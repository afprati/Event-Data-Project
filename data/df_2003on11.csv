 The hostage-taking in North Ossetia school topped the bulletins of Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya and Al-Alam throughout the day. Other stories that featured regularly include the first meeting of the newly appointed Iraqi National Assembly, foreign hostages in Iraq and demonstrations in Kathmandu, Nepal, against the killing of nationals in Iraq. The three channels also covered, albeit with less focus, the story of Iraqi politician Al-Chalabi escaping attempt on his life, the arrest of a high-ranking member of Al-Qa'idah in Pakistan, Taleban attack of US base in southern Afghanistan, the killing of Iraqi in Musol attack and the US Republican convention held in New York.
:as listed
The long coverage of the events in North Ossetia by the three channels was factual and neutral in tone. They all showed almost similar footage from the scene. They also went over yesterday's Moscow attack, and recalled the crash of the two Russian passenger planes, highlighting the possibility of Chechenyan involvement. The three channels carried lengthy live relays by their correspondents and interviewed analysts. Al-Jazeera spoke to a Russian fluent Arabic speaking analyst from Moscow and to a Chechnyan academic from Jordan. They both stressed the Chechnyan presidential elections as possible motivation for the attacks.
 The issue of hostages in Iraq also featured consistently throughout. Al-Arabiya, in particular, devoted ample air time to it and opened a number of its bulletins with related latest developments. It also broke the story of the release of seven hostages by the Black Flags groups and covered it live, as well as the release of a Turkish hostage and the kidnapping of a Jordanian in Iraq. But of all three, Al-Alam was the only one to show part of the video of the gruesome execution of the 12 Nepalese. As for Al-Jazeera, it carried a lengthy interview with French Foreign Minister Barnier. It is worth noting that the interviewer's questions sounded like prompters to the minister to stress the pro-Arab French foreign policy and appeal for the release of the two French journalists.
 The coverage of the first meeting of the Iraqi National Assembly was factual and neutral by the three channels. However, Al-Arabiya carried live the news conference of the newly elected speaker, while the Iraqi station Al-Iraqiyah showed live part of the morning's proceedings.
 Coverage of follow-up to yesterday's attacks in Beersheba featured on Al-Alam and Al-Arabiya. Speaking on Israeli reaction, Al-Alam's reporter said: ""The Jewish state vowed to continue the building of the racist separation wall"". Both channels showed a demonstration by Hamas in Gaza, celebrating the two attacks.
 Some channels had exclusive coverage of some stories, such as:
 Fire in oil pipeline in northern Iraq by Al-Alam
 Hikmatyar's call for the boycott of Afghan presidential elections, and north Korean seeking political asylum in a Japanese school in Beijing, by Al-Jazeera
 Rally in Lebanon marking anniversary of disappearance of Shi'a leader Musa al-Sadr, by Al-Arabiya. Clip of Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri attacking ""the Libyan criminal regime"" was shown repeatedly.
 In its 1600 gmt main bulletin, Al-Iraqiyah focused mainly on domestic issues: The opening session of the Iraqi National Assembly; Allawi condemning the attack on Al-Chalabi; youth centre; computer training in Basra; water treatment station.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 14 January, by Dirgha Raj Upadhyay
Dhangadhi [far-west Nepal], 13 January [Saturday]: Maoists have detained a group of forestry officials, including the regional forest director. The team had visited a community forest to investigate timber smuggling.
The team of foresters had visited the Sunpat community forest located near the Maoist camp after getting the information that khayar trees were being smuggled by a company that had won a contract to collect timber. [passage omitted]
The Maoists detained them when they were returning after investigations on Saturday [13 January]. The Maoists claim they took the forest officials under their control because they were involved in smuggling timber.
Kailali district Maoist chief Paras Mani said the forestry officials were stopped at the request of the local people. The rebels said they had received complaints about involvement of forestry officials in timber smuggling. They admitted that six forest officials were in their control and they would be freed after necessary questioning.
With the permission of the district forest office, the Sunpat community forest had granted permission to local man Binod K.C. to collect and sell fallen and old trees in the community forest.
The valuable khayar trees were reportedly being smuggled from the forest. The security agency in the district was not able to take any action in the absence of solid evidence.

General Pyar Jung Thapa said the military was determined to crush the insurgency, dismissing their four-month-old ceasefire as ""crooked tricks"" and a ""ploy.""
""The Maoists have abducted over 8,000 civilians, forcibly recruited children, tormented and displaced army families and extorted money during the so-called truce,"" a military statement released on Tuesday quoted Thapa telling troops in eastern Nepal Monday.
On Friday, Nepal's insurgent Maoists extended a three-month unilateral ceasefire by one month, a move welcomed by the United Nations and the European Union.
Human rights groups accuse both the Maoists and the Royal Nepalese Army of abuses that include torture.
The Maoists and seven mainstream opposition parties agreed last month to form an anti-royal alliance to restore democracy in the troubled Himalayan kingdom. Nepalese King Gyanendra fired a civilian government and seized power on February 1 ostensibly to end the deadly Maoist revolt.
The rebels and opposition parties set out a 12-point plan and called for an end to fighting and for elections to be held under UN auspices.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed more than 12,000 lives.

"7492",20112404,"Title: Pakistan _ India and Pakistan _ retrospect and prospect.rtf; Date: January 15, 2011 Saturday; Text: KARACHI, Jan. 15 -- Mani Shankar Aiyar, an MP of Indian Rajya Sabha and former Consul-General of India had delivered a lecture to Karachi Council of Foreign Relations on 'India and Pakistan: Retrospect and prospect' a few days ago.
Following is second part of the text of his address - Part-I was published on Thursday - in which he has described his personal experience while living in Pakistan as an Indian official and also highlighted relations between India and Pakistan:
""Yet, there are several levels at which this argument breaks down. First, the Indian Muslim community: are they not living in harmony with their Hindu brethren? If there were no compatibility, how is it that almost every icon of India's 85% Hindu youth is unabashedly Muslim: the four Khans - superstars Shah Rukh, Aamir, Salman, and Saif; leading ladies like Katrina Kaif following Madhubala, Meena Kumari and Nargis of yore and Waheeda Rahman and Shabana Azmi more recently; the golden voice of Mohd Rafi and Talat Mehmood; the lyrics of Sahir Ludhianvi and Javed Akhtar; music director AR Rahman (who was born Dilip Kumar and converted to Islam, where his renowned predecessor in the run-up to partition, Dilip Kumar, the actor, was born Yusuf Khan in Peshawar and converted to Bollywood under an assumed Hindu name); the makers of Peepli Live, Mehmood Farooqui and Anusha Rizvi, India's sure-fire entry for this year's Oscars; ustads such as Bismillah Khan, Vilayat Khan, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Amjad Ali Khan and tabla maestros, Allah Rakha and Zakir Hussain; cricketers like Tiger Pataudi and Azharuddin, and tennis star, Sania Mirza, whom we share, besides a whole galaxy of highly influential opinion-makers of whom I need mention only three - the Group Editor of the India Today stable, MJ Akbar; columnist Saeed Naqvi; and historian Mushirul Hassan, Director of the National Archives - and business barons, Aziz Premji and Anu Agha. The point needs no labouring.""
Except that the Justice Rajinder Sachar report will immediately be thrown at those who suggest that the lived experience of secular India shows no incompatibility between the two alleged 'nations' of Hindu and Muslim. Yes, indeed, in many, many respects the denizens of the Muslim community are worse off than their non-Muslim counterparts in northern India. Equally undeniable is that while the North Indian Muslim elite largely took off for Pakistan at partition, the vast majority of the ordinary Muslims voted with their feet to remain where they were. Deprived of a middle-class and a political leadership, the community has striven to raise itself by its boot-straps and while there are success stories there is much leeway to be made up. This points to the need for more affirmative action; it emphatically does not mean that Hindu and Muslim cannot live under one national roof.
Moreover, it needs to be recognised - in Pakistan, of course, but much more in India - that where population transfer did not take place, as in South India, the Muslim community is doing quite exceptionally well - and is not resented by the majority community for doing so.
I do not want to make a polemical point. I simply want to assert here on Pakistani soil that whatever might have been the argument for a Muslim-majority State on this South Asian sub-continent at the time of independence and partition, now that Pakistan has been in existence for sixty years and more, the generic argument for Hindu-Muslim incompatibility has lost its sheen and transmuted more into national hostility than communal animosity.""
""In this context, I'd like to share a story with you about what happened when I addressed a Jang Forum meeting in Karachi a few years ago. I was asked from the audience how I could claim to be a friend of Pakistan when I rejected the Two-Nation theory. I replied that whatever the merits of the theory in the period leading up to independence and partition, it was time now to recognise that the Two-Nation Theory had given way to the Three-State Reality, and that if we continued to advocate the Two Nation Theory, it would have to mean that the 15 crore Muslims in India are traitors to their country. At this, the questioner, delighted with my answer, bounded on to the stage, embraced me, and handing over a visiting card describing him as the Vice Chairman of the Karachi Marriage Hall Owners Association, whispered in my ear that when I got married again, he promised me a marriage hall for free! That, I regard, as the highest compliment I have ever received. My wife, however, disapproves - I wonder why?
Reciprocally, it is little known in India, and little bruited about in Pakistan, how many members of Pakistan's non-Muslim minorities hold positions of distinction and responsibility in Pakistan, not only in the higher echelons but in the grassroots institutions of local government, in the civil services, in the judiciary, in agriculture, in business and the arts. Partition over, as the Quaid-i-Azam said before Pakistan "

Police were posted on most streets as organisers said they were expecting up to 300,000 people to join the rally at the Open Theatre in the city.
They are protesting the king's sacking of the elected prime minister on October 4. Gyanendra took power for a week before appointing a royalist interim government and also indefinitely postponed a general election.
The political parties say that the current government does not have a mandate to negotiate with Maoist rebels.
Talks between the government and the rebels opened Sunday after a ceasefire was announced in January following seven years of insurgency that have cost 7,800 lives.
The rally is being organised jointly by the Nepali Congress (NC), the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninists (NCP-UML), the Nepal Peasants and Workers' Party (NPWP), People's Front-Nepal (PF-N) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NGP).
""The government is liberal and will respect the rights of the opposition parties to demonstrate and voice their grievances, but it should be peaceful,"" said Minster for Information and General Administration Ramesh Nath Pandey.

Shops and businesses shut across much of the country as the opposition pressed a general strike. Tensions had eased in the previous two days due to the Nepali New Year's holiday.
Thousands of people marched for miles Saturday afternoon along the ring road encircling Katmandu, shouting ""Down with the monarchy! Salute the republic!""
""Life will be brought to a standstill,"" said Subash Nemwang of the Communist Party of Nepal, one of the seven opposition parties organizing the strike and protests, which entered their 10th day Saturday.
About 200 journalists tried to march through Katmandu Saturday morning to demand more press freedom and the release of dozens of reporters detained since King Gyanendra seized absolute power 14 months ago.
Police blocked the rally and charged with batons, injuring seven people and detaining at least a dozen, organizers said.
""We will continue ... protests until all restrictions on the media are fully lifted,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists.
There were demonstrations demanding King Gyanendra relinquish power in numerous other towns and cities, officials and local media said.
""There should be no constitutional monarchy. There should be pure democracy because the monarchy has been very bad to the people of Nepal,"" said one of the Katmandu marchers, 24-year-old agriculture student Ujwal Dhakal.
The Katmandu protest moved through neighborhoods in the capital that have been flashpoints for violence between protesters and police. It remained peaceful until demonstrators tried to enter the city center, where rallies are banned.
When police blocked their way across a small bridge, a brief melee broke out as officers beat them back with batons and fired a few cylinders of tear gas. No one was injured in the skirmish, which ended within minutes. The protest ended a short while later.
Gyanendra said he took control to restore political order and end a communist insurgency that has left nearly 13,000 people dead in the past decade.
His royal government has since banned criticism of the king, the government and security forces, along with independent reporting on the rebellion to abolish the monarchy and establish a communist state.
The protests, which began April 6, are the worst unrest Gyanendra has faced since his power grab in this mountain kingdom, which long has attracted mountain climbers looking to scale peaks like Mt. Everest and Western hippies searching for Eastern spirituality.
Although most demonstrations have been peaceful, some have degenerated into battles between brick-throwing demonstrators and security forces, who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, on a few occasions, live ammunition.
Four people have been fatally shot and hundreds have been beaten, fueling anti-royalist sentiment and prompting criticism from the United Nations.
The seven main opposition parties decided late Friday to continue with the strike and protests after Gyanendra offered few concessions in his annual New Year's message.
""The strike appeared to be relaxed over the last two days, but that will change from today,"" Nemwang of the Communist Party said Saturday.

The abductions happened between Saturday and Wednesday in Accham district 400 kilometres (250 miles) northwest of the capital Kathmandu.
The students and teachers, mainly from secondary schools, were forcibly marched to an undisclosed location for indoctrination by the rebels, a human rights official said.
""We have received information from our bureau that the Maoists have abducted hundreds of students, teachers and other civilians from scores of villages in Achham district,"" said Subodh Pyakurel, president of the Informal Sector Service Centre human rights group.
Pyakurel said ""they were taken as flocks of sheep to undisclosed locations.""
Police also reported the abduction of 60 students from a school in Dolpa district, 475 kilometres (270 miles) northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday.
""The Maoists selected 60 sturdy looking boys and girls of grades six to 10 and abducted them,"" police said after a teacher at the school reached the district headquarters Dunai on Thursday.
The rebels, who are fighting to install a communist republic, regularly abduct students for indoctrination sessions and normally release them several days later.
Local human rights groups and the United Nations Children's Fund have routinely condemned the abductions and have received pledges from the Maoists to halt the practice.
Pyakurel appealed to the rebels to release the children.
""We appeal to the Maoists to be sincere in their words and stop abducting  docile villagers, students and other civilians,"" Pyakurel said.
Separately, a district security officer who declined to be named, said the rebels destroyed three government buildings with explosives in southwest Nepal Tuesday after evacuating workers.
""The rebels had forced the staff to leave and set off the explosive devices destroying the offices,"" the official said from Doti district, 425 kilometres southwest of Kathmandu.
The rebels announced a unilateral ceasefire in early September aimed at winning support from political parties for a joint challenge to the king.
King Gyanendra sacked a four-party government in February for failing to tackle the Maoist rebellion that has claimed about 12,000 lives since 1996.
In August the parties said they would hold talks with the Maoists on forming a broad front against Gyanendra provided the rebels stop killing civilians.

Speaking at a programme organized today by Nepal Youth Society in honour of media, Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Sarbendra Nath Shukla said that the government is always ready for peace talks.
 ""I request the Maoists to translate cease-fire into practice,"" he said. Explaining that bloodshed would never solve the conflict, Shukla also asked them to quit violence and come to the negotiating table.
 The Maoists, following appeals from civil society and different political parties to halt bloodshed during the Dashain festival, announced a nine-day cease-fire from Saptami through Purnima.
 On the occasion, RPP ruling Rastriya Prajatantra Party central committee member Bhuvan Pathak also appealed to everyone for peaceful settlement to the conflict.
 Meanwhile, appreciating the Maoists' nine-day cease-fire, seven agitating student unions have urged the government and the Maoists to find a political way out to the current crisis.
 ""We would like to clarify that translating the cease-fire into lasting peace is the call of the day, ""they have stated in a joint press release issued with Dashain greetings.

 Biratnagar, 3 April: Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa today warned that if the agitation spiralled out of hand, the government would not hesitate to crack down on the protesters. Thapa had arrived here to inaugurate the Hridyendra Children Garden.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Apr 04
While issuing his warning, he also appealed to the five agitating parties to conduct the agitation in a dignified manner. Stating that staging rallies was a fundamental right of the parties, Thapa lashed out at them for choking the streets of the capital in the name of exercising their democratic rights.
 Asked if the government had tried to take the present agitation in its own control, Thapa said it was not so. The PM added that patience was the need of the hour if the present political crisis was to be solved. Emotional outbursts would never provide the way out of the impasse in the country. Thapa also called for consensus among the parties.
 Thapa said everything about the date of polls was clear from the king's recent address in Pokhara in which he called for conditions to be created to make it possible to hold an election within the next 12 months .
 ""Didn't you hear the king's address in Pokhara? Everything is clear,"" the PM said.

"4895",20066755,"Title: Dalai Lama urges against generalizing Muslims after meeting pope.rtf; Date: October 15, 2006 Sunday 1:17 AM GMT; Text: The Dalai Lama said after meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in Rome that efforts should be taken to overcome dangerous generalizations depicting all members of a religion as ""militants"" ready to take up violence, the Italian state news agency reported.
The Dalai Lama's remarks Friday followed a speech Benedict gave in his native Germany last month in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as ""evil and inhuman,"" particularly ""his command to spread by the sword the faith.""
The speech provoked protests from Muslims across the world. The pope said the quotation did not reflect his personal view of Islam, and he expressed deep regret that Muslims had been offended by it. Some Muslim leaders have demanded a fuller apology.
The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, also referred Friday to ""mistaken"" judgments sparked by ""a few mischievous Muslims,"" the ANSA news agency quoted him as telling reporters.
His remarks echoed comments he made in an interview with The Associated Press last month when he said: ""Mischievous people often use religious faith for their own interests and create conflict. We have to look at the real message of all these traditions.""
The Vatican has maintained a low profile on past visits by the Dalai Lama, including his last in 2003 to meet with John Paul II, to avoid a further chill in its icy relations with China.
The Dalai Lama wants autonomy for Tibet, which China has occupied since 1951. He led about 80,000 Tibetans into exile in 1959, and heads a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India.
China's government bars Catholics from having contact with the Vatican and allows worship only in government-monitored churches. Millions remain loyal to the pope and worship in secret, but priests and members of their congregations frequently are detained and harassed.
Activist groups said earlier in the week that Chinese forces had detained a group of Tibetan children after border guards fatally shot at least one refugee trying to flee to Nepal across a Himalayan mountain pass.
Asked about the border case, the Dalai Lama told AP Television News on Saturday that it was ""very sad.""
""We have been experiencing such cases for more than 50 years. Very sad,"" he said.
Rome's Third University, part of the state university system, gave the Dalai Lama an honorary degree in biology Saturday in recognition of ""considerable progress"" made by the spiritual leader's Mind and Life Institute in exploring the relationship between the brain and the mind, biochemistry professor Pier Luigi Luisi said.

""No foreign country should intervene in the peace talks between the Maoist leaders and the Nepalese government,"" ambassador Shyam Sharan said at a press meeting in Kathmandu.
He indicated though that India could play a role in reconciling the monarchy and the political parties who have been protesting against King Gyanendra since he sacked the elected prime minister in October and postponed elections.
""If it is needed, India can to play a role in improving relations between the king and parties,"" he said.
""The major political parties of Nepal must participate in the peace dialogue to make it effective and successful,"" he said.
The rebels and the government, who declared a ceasefire in January, have both asked the five main parties to join the talks.
But the parties have refused as they are boycotting the government of Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who was appointed by the king.
The two sides have held two rounds of talks and a third is due on Sunday.
Sharan said the rebels had links with Maoist groups in India including the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and the People's War Group (PWG), which are active in the eastern states of Bihar and Jharkhand and the southern south of Andra Pradesh.
But he added: ""If the Maoists give up terrorism and come under the multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy parameters, we will accept them.""
The Maoist rebels in Nepal have been fighting since 1996 for a communist republic and the violence has so far claimed more than 7,800 lives.

"6861",20082962,"Title: Nepal 's former king adjusts to life as commoner.rtf; Date: June 12, 2008 Thursday 8:21 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's former king Gyanendra woke up Thursday as a commoner after leaving his sprawling palace home and army of servants, in line with the abolition of the country's 240-year-old dynasty.
He will have to adjust to living in a former hunting lodge on the outskirts of the capital after leaving the Narayanhiti palace late Wednesday in the back of a black Mercedes with his wife, Komal Shah.
Two weeks ago, the impoverished Himalayan nation's new constituent assembly, dominated by former Maoist rebels, voted to abolish the monarchy, making Nepal the world's newest republic.
Early Thursday, police replaced the soldiers who had guarded the palace set in acres of manicured lawns -- which is now set to become a national museum, featuring the former king's diamond, ruby and emerald crown and sceptre.
Gyanendra, who once was revered as a reincarnation of a Hindu deity and ruled the country's armed forces, said late Wednesday in his first comments since the vote that he would abide by the assembly's decision.
""I have assisted in and respected the verdict of the people,"" he said in a short address in a hall decorated with stuffed tigers and a rhino head.
Gyanendra, who assumed the throne after a bloody palace massacre in 2001 and was deeply unpopular with the people here, said he ""will not leave this country"" and go into exile.
Nepal's Maoists, who waged a deadly insurgency for a decade before a landmark peace deal with the country's mainstream political parties in 2006, praised Gyanendra's decision to abandon the palace without a struggle.
""It's very significant that he has accepted the decision made to end his reign with no trouble. He has made the right decision,"" Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told AFP.
Narayan Wagle, editor of the Kantipur Nepali-language daily, said it was a ""graceful"" end to the world's only Hindu monarchy.
""He has exited gracefully and peacefully and his message focused on garnering sympathy from the Nepalese people in the future,"" said Wagle.
In his address, Gyanendra hit back at charges he was behind the palace massacre that vaulted him to the throne.
""My family and I have been continuously defamed with ill intentions which was saddening and still is. The accusations targeted against us were inhuman,"" he said.
Gyanendra became king when his nephew Dipendra, the then crown prince, killed most of his family, including the king and queen, in a drink- and drug-fuelled rage after being prevented from marrying the woman he loved.
He then shot himself and was briefly declared king while brain dead, before Gyanendra became monarch.
Many in the country believed Gyanendra had himself plotted the palace killings, even though an official probe cleared him of any involvement.
Gyanendra ended more than a year of authoritarian rule in April 2006 after massive protests organised by the parties and the Maoists -- a stepping stone to their peace deal.
The government has allowed the former king to keep 75 security personnel. But Gyanendra and his former queen lost 600 domestic staff when they moved to their new smaller premises.
""All former royal staff including palace secretaries, housemaids, gardeners, cooks and cleaners have become government employees,"" a home ministry spokesman said.

"5025",20065451,"Title: Nepal 's communist rebels call indefinite nationwide strike starting April 3.rtf; Date: February 18, 2006 Saturday 2:59 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's communist insurgents on Saturday called for a nationwide indefinite strike starting April 3, while the country's major political parties prepared for a large weekend protest in the capital amid growing anger at the king's autocratic rule.
The strike will be preceded by a series of blockades on roads leading to the capital, Katmandu, and other main cities starting March 14, said a statement said by rebel leaders Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai.
Schools and businesses will be forced to close, and transportation disrupted during the strike, the statement said.
The rebels' strike call and Sunday's planned rally follow a series of political setbacks to King Gyanendra's authoritarian rule.
""The (royal) regime is counting its final days,"" the rebel statement said. ""Time has come to make the final strike on the regime that has been isolated and defamed.""
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have fought for a decade to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist state.
Gyanendra seized power in February last year, saying it would help quell the festering insurgency and clean up corruption in the government. But fighting between the rebels and security forces has since escalated and the king is facing growing criticism both at home and abroad.
The past week has seen the Supreme Court order the release of dozens of political detainees and dissolved an anti-corruption body, allegedly used by the royalist government to crack down on opponents.
Emboldened by the court's rulings, political parties hope Sunday's rally will be the biggest since the royal takeover.
More than 10,000 protesters are expected to join the rally, said Shobhakar Parajuli, a spokesman for the Nepali Congress party, which is among seven major parties that have formed an alliance to push for democracy.
The demonstration marks Democracy Day, which celebrates a popular movement of the 1980s that forced the previous king to establish a multiparty democracy.
Hundreds have been jailed since the monarch seized power a year ago and declared a state of emergency, some for a few days and others for several months.
On Friday, the Supreme Court ordered the release of 37 political detainees, including senior party officials. Judges Pramananda Jha and Rajendra Koirala said they could find no reason for the detentions and ordered the government to immediately free them.
Also last week, the court released several other detainees and scrapped the Royal Commission for Corruption Control, which had jailed several political leaders on bribery charges in an apparent bid to prevent them from mobilizing support against the king's direct rule.
The court's rulings show the king's activities are ""nothing but illegal,"" Parajuli said.
The political impasse has also resulted in increasing violations of human rights both by the security forces and the rebels.
On Friday, an abducted government official died in rebel custody in eastern Nepal, a news report said.
Prem Prasad Sapkota, an administrator for Koshi zone, died of an asthma attack, the Samachar Patra newspaper quoted a local rebel leader as saying. Sapkota was kidnapped along with 14 other government officials and security personnel during a Feb. 7 rebel raid in the region. Eleven were later released, but Sapkota and three others were not.
Elsewhere in southern Nepal, the rebels freed three employees of tobacco company Surya Nepal Ltd. after detaining them for two weeks, said a report posted on the Internet site of the Kantipur group of publications.
The Maoist insurgency has claimed nearly 13,000 lives in the past decade.

Excerpt from report by privately-owned Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 27 February; subheadings inserted editorially
[By Baburam Kharel] Kathmandu, [Sunday] 27 February: A visibly exhausted group of 62 Nepali migrant workers evacuated from conflict-ridden Libya on Saturday landed in Nepal from Alexandria of Egypt. Penniless, but happy; happy to be where the heart is - home
They were brought home on an Air Arabia flight arranged by SOS manpower company and the Nepali mission in Egypt. After landing at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the first batch of returnees in dishevelled outfits recalled ordeals that they faced in Libya and how they managed to escape from armed protesters who ransacked their dormitories and camps, and also how they reached the Libya-Egypt border with the combined efforts of Egyptians and the construction company.
Beaten
Among the returnees, Shree Bahadur Garbuja, 43, a native of Myagdi, was the one who was beaten black and blue by armed protesters while he was staying in a camp near the construction company where he had been working in Durnah in Libya. ""It was a nightmare... staying safe from armed protesters was tough and we had not sufficient food and water,"" Garbuja said, tears rolling down his cheeks. 
Some of his colleagues lost their passports while others were robbed of their money and belongings. Nepali blue-collar workers are facing a tough time fleeing Libya after protests escalated. Garbuja had gone to Libya in search of green pastures some eight months ago through SOS manpower company but his dreams shattered as he could not bring home money and some gifts for his little daughter and son. [passage omitted]
Officials said more than 60 Nepali workers in Alexandria, Egypt, are expected to land in Nepal by Sunday. They said that efforts are being made to bring back home remaining 500 Nepalis. Around 562 Nepalis working for A-One construction company were stranded after their quarters were burnt by local assailants last month, and their problem compounded in the wake of anti-government protest about two weeks ago in Libya.
Undersecretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dhan Bahadur Oli, who is involved in rescue operation of Nepalis in Libya and Egypt, said that the Nepali mission is facing hurdles entering crisis-ridden Libya. ""We are trying to reach out to the Nepali community there by all possible means,"" Oli said.
Some returning via China
Some 20s [as published] Nepali are likely to cross the Libyan border soon. Of those of the 600 staying in Benghazi city of Libya, 193 are coming through China, he said. The Nepali mission in Cairo is also planning to bring back close to 200 Nepalis by a charted flight by Monday.
Meanwhile, foreign employment agencies have sought security from the government as they fear that those who returning from Libya could be provoked by hostile elements.
""Although they returned here due to crisis in Libya, who knows that they will not be provoked against us. We suspect that they could forward demands to return again to Libya after the situation calms down. Some might even want their money back,"" an owner of a foreign employment agency said.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) made its appeal in letters to both sides.
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire last month to pave way for negotiations to end seven years of violence.

""I hope the new government which is going to be formed soon will work in consensus and include all the political parties and bring policies and programmes that will benefit all,"" Ram Baran Yadav said in a televised address.
""We don't have any alternative other than maintaining our politics of consensus and reconciliation to bring the peace process to a logical conclusion,"" the new president said.
Nepal has been without a proper government since May 28, when a newly-elected assembly that will write a new constitution for the Himalayan country abolished a 240-year-old monarchy and declared a republic.
""We have an arduous task of drafting a new constitution in two years' time, so the need of the hour is to maintain unity among all the parties represented in the assembly,"" said Yadav, a 61-year-old former health minister.
Nepal's Maoists won over a third of the seats in April elections to the 601-seat constitutional assembly but have been unable to muster a majority to form a government on their own.
Despite earlier saying they would not head the government to lead the impoverished nation after their presidential candidate lost, they now say they are willing to lead a new administration if certain conditions are met.
The former rebels want the main rival political blocs to guarantee that no attempts will be made to topple their government for at least two years.
They also want the rival parties to agree to allow the Maoists to push through a ""minimum programme.""
The ex-rebels want to deliver sweeping reforms, including a major shake-up of what they see as a feudal land-ownership structure.
However, the two largest parties in the assembly after the Maoists, the centrist Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, have rejected the Maoist demands.
Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told AFP that negotiations were in progress.
""We are in discussions with the parties regarding our proposal for the formation of the government under our leadership,"" said Mahara.
""It will take a few days more before we come to a decision. As of now, the government under our leadership cannot be ruled out.""
The ultra-leftists' continued involvement in mainstream politics is seen as crucial to the survival of the peace process which ended a decade of civil war.

The IPI said ""almost every country in Europe has introduced new anti-terrorism laws after September 11 (attacks in the United States) and a number have inhibited the media's work.""
It said ""in Russia, where eight journalists were killed, a new draft law seeks to regulate the media during an attack by terrorists.""
""In Asia, with 13 journalists murdered, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines have proposed new anti-terrorism measures while, in Malaysia, the war on terrorism undermined efforts to repeal the notorious Internal Security Act,"" the report said.
It added that ""after securing the favour of the United States in the war on terrorism, countries such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan suppress the media with impunity.
""Terrorists and security forces in Nepal also deliberately targeted the media this year, but there were improvements in Sri Lanka,"" it said.
""Fuelled by conflict in Palestine and Israel, seven journalists were killed in the Middle East and North Africa, where countries routinely stifle dissent and free speech,"" the report said.
It said that ""in Iran, the struggle between conservatives and reformers has led to the closure of publications and harsh prison sentences for journalists.""
""Jordan has used the war on terrorism to tighten its restrictive penal laws while Tunisia and Saudi Arabia remain reluctant to loosen their grip on the Internet.""
Africa ""confronted by famine and wars"" had problems that ""transcend the war on terrorism,"" the report said.
Two journalists were killed last year in Africa, where ""leaders of impoverished countries seek new ways to stay in power.""
But ""the Americas is still the most dangerous region in the world with 22 journalists killed, 15 of them by left- and right-wing terrorists in Colombia,"" the report said.
""In the United States, growing surveillance and enforcement powers to combat terrorism have raised fears over the balance struck between security and liberty; while Venezuela and other Latin American countries contain groups united in their hatred of the media,"" it said.
It added that ""although no journalists were killed in the Australasian and Oceanic region, the influence of traditional kings and local politicians is ever present. The media are often prevented from reporting critically and even excluded.""

"2229",20043056,"Title: Near_Middle East_ Round-up of Friday sermons 24 Sept 04.rtf; Date: September 28, 2004, Tuesday; Text: The following is a round-up of Friday sermons carried by the news media of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Syria, Iraq, Qatar and Egypt on 24 September.
 Saudi Arabia
 Saudi Arabia TV1 and TV2, official television stations of the Saudi government, on Friday 24 September carry live sermons from the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina.
 Saudi Arabia TV1 carries at 0922 gmt a live sermon from the holy mosque in Mecca. Shaykh Salih Bin-Abdallah Bin-Humayd delivers the sermon.
 The preacher begins by counting God Almighty's blessings and thanking Him for them. He warns Muslims against ""travelling without rations and going to a lonely grave without a companion"". He goes on to highlight the importance of time and warns against squandering it. He also warns against wasting time in the markets, in front of the television, and on Internet websites.
The shaykh says the topic of the sermon is education, curricula, guidance and good utilization of time as families are welcoming the new scholastic year. He says: ""Creativity, finding new talent, and developing one's gifts are essential requirements and good means for the mind, as are character-building and investing time in useful studies and activities.""
 ""On the other hand,"" he says, ""providing a sound and public atmosphere in which to practice activities, correct worship and good ethics will ensure young people and the youth are brought up in a sound, honest, and balanced manner in both life and religion. These public activities will prepare them to be honest and successful so they can be of benefit to themselves, their kin, nation, and homeland"".
 The shaykh advises the worshippers to invest their time in social services' offices, educational courses, and Koran recitation and memorization classes. He says: ""These offer educational opportunities and a useful gathering of well-informed young people who invest their time, do good deeds, and bolster relations. These classes are well-prepared to educate people about good behaviour, religious practices, remedying mistakes, and straightening what is crooked in the footsteps of our forefathers."" He adds: ""These educational lectures, albeit short, have benefits that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. These centres, courses, lessons and activities give instruction in high morals and preach against bad and inferior ethics. They take part in nurturing and cultivating the spirit of creativity. These centres, activities, courses, lessons, and so on are testimony that the young need a kind and merciful hand that can offer them advice and guidance in a friendly and sympathetic manner. Kindness will help them appreciate their role in life, their impact on society, and their significance for their nation. This way they will become aware of the dangers threatening them, their religion and country. They will remind them of good examples to follow from the past and from the nation's leaders, scholars, and figures so they can learn how to truly believe in belonging to their religion and feel proud of their nation and protective of their country. This will make them less susceptible to campaigns of Westernization, assimilation, penetration, all forms of fundamentalism, radicalism, and exaggeration.""
 Shaykh Bin-Humayd adds: ""It is certain that these centres, courses, lessons, and so on are educational incubators that protect the time of our youth, both boys and girls, guiding them in terms of education, good upbringing, and behaviour as well as professionally and vocationally to the right and honest way and high morality. They also bolster their belonging to God's faith, religious brotherhood, allegiance to the leaders or guardians, love for scholars, appreciation for the nation's prominent figures, as well as affection and respect for both young and old. They will also gain skills, explore their gifts and talents, and learn to deal with problems and contribute to identifying and solving them.
 ""These centres, courses and classes also spread the spirit of cooperation and productive collective work, conscientiousness, and pride and they generate positive attitudes towards work, training, accuracy, creativity, and renewal using advanced technical means and stimulating and innovative training methods. They also train the youth to provide public services, maintain public facilities, repair both public and private property, abide by good manners, and join scientific courses and intellectual seminars in which they can learn good manners of speech, listening to others' opinions, dealing with others, and accepting the right from wherever it might come.""
 Shaykh Bin-Humayd continues: ""Hundreds of thousands of young men and women have joined centres, seminars, classes and courses in various extra-curricular activities not offered by schools, colleges, or universities, nor can they be found in the school syllabus. In these centres, young people discover and explore their abilities and talents. This is all done under "

""No foreign country should intervene in the peace talks between the Maoist leaders and the Nepalese government,"" ambassador Shyam Sharan said at a press meeting in Kathmandu.
He indicated though that India could play a role in reconciling the monarchy and the political parties who have been protesting against King Gyanendra since he sacked the elected prime minister in October and postponed elections.
""If it is needed, India can to play a role in improving relations between the king and parties,"" he said.
""The major political parties of Nepal must participate in the peace dialogue to make it effective and successful,"" he said.
The rebels and the government, who declared a ceasefire in January, have both asked the five main parties to join the talks.
But the parties have refused as they are boycotting the government of Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who was appointed by the king.
The two sides have held two rounds of talks and a third is due on Sunday.
Sharan said the rebels had links with Maoist groups in India including the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and the People's War Group (PWG), which are active in the eastern states of Bihar and Jharkhand and the southern south of Andra Pradesh.
But he added: ""If the Maoists give up terrorism and come under the multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy parameters, we will accept them.""
The Maoist rebels in Nepal have been fighting since 1996 for a communist republic and the violence has so far claimed more than 7,800 lives.

Koirala, the president of the Nepali Congress party, said he has maintained his silence on the issue because he feared his revelations would result in fresh unrest in the Himalayan kingdom, the Kathmandu Post reported.
Koirala's party was ousted from government by the new king last year, though he was not prime minister at the time.
""I deliberately choose to keep (quiet), but I will expose everything at an opportune time … the time is not far away,"" the Post quoted Koirala as saying.
King Birendra, Queen Aiswarya and eight other members of the royal family were shot dead in the Narayanhiti Royal Palace on June 1, 2001. A government investigation found that Crown Prince Dipendra, high on drugs and alcohol, carried out the shootings before killing himself.
Koirala's comments came two days before King Gyanendra, brother of the slain King Birendra, was to make a public appearance in Koirala's hometown of Biratnagar, 500 kilometers (312 miles) east of Katmandu.
Gyanendra assumed power after the massacre and has been gaining support of the people, despite firing the elected Nepali Congress government in October and replacing it with a pro-monarchy prime minister and Cabinet.
Security has been beefed up with soldiers and policemen mobilized in the industrial city near the Indian border, where the king was expected to address the gathering.
Thousands of people were expected to attend, despite threats and a general strike called by the Maoist rebels fighting to end the monarchy and democratic parliament.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to turn Nepal into a communist state. More than 7,000 people have been killed in the insurgency.

 Kathmandu, 27 March: US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Christina Rocca said that the United States would continue to support Nepal, both militarily as well as in development aid, according to information posted in the web site of the US Department of State.
 In a prepared statement for the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in Washington Wednesday 26 March , Rocca said minor military aid to Nepal would continue.

She also welcomed the recently declared cease-fire and code of conduct and attributed the Maoist willingness to come to negotiating table to effective action of the RNA army . ""We believe the parties have come this far only because the RNA was able to make an effective stand - a goal which US security assistance aims to bolster.""
 Rocca added that if a political solution to the insurgency was reached, then the US should be in the forefront of donors to help Nepal hold local and nations elections and strengthen administrative and democratic institutions. The US assistant secretary of state said that in the short term ""we will continue to support improved governance and respect for basic human rights, improved health services and rural livelihoods, and sustainable development"".
 On the issue refugee problem between Nepal and Bhutan, Rocca said Bhutan must take back those refugees who are bona fide Bhutanese nationals.

"5608",20066925,"Title: Stakes high in Nepal 's renewed peace talks_ analysts.rtf; Date: October 7, 2006 Saturday 5:13 AM GMT; Text: The stakes are high for Sunday's second set of talks between Nepal's government and rebel Maoists in determining whether a slow-moving peace process to end a decade-old insurgency remains on track, analysts say.
The rebels have warned that if the peace talks break down, they will call crippling, mass protests in the capital Kathmandu.
""The rebels' threat of protests in the capital cannot be taken lightly. They are a political group who have weapons, and they have concentrated their cadres in Kathmandu,"" said Rabindra Khanal, who teaches politics at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan University.
Both sides have observed a ceasefire since protests, spearheaded by the Maoists and political parties in a loose alliance, forced King Gyanendra to end 14 months of absolute rule in April and restore parliament.
But little progress has been made in ending the insurgency, which has killed at least 12,500 people, and the rebels have accused the government of dragging its feet and reneging on promises.
""We can't expect the meeting between the prime minister and the rebel chief to resolve all issues,"" said Kapil Shrestha, who also teaches political science at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan University.
""But it will be crucial in showing how the two sides can move forward.""
The areas of dispute between the rebels and government, and within the multi-party government itself, are manifold.
They include the future of the monarchy, disarmament of the rebels and control of the army and bringing the insurgents into an interim government.
The first meeting between Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and rebel leader Prachanda in June led to a breakthrough announcement that a temporary  constitution would be drafted within a month that would allow the Maoists to join a new interim government.
In addition the two sides agreed to hold elections for a constituent assembly that would rewrite the constitution permanently, a key rebel demand.
But little headway has been made since then.
The temporary constitution remains unfinished because the ruling seven-party alliance is divided on such issues as whether a referendum on the 238-year-old monarchy can take place to decide its ultimate fate.
The second round of high-level talks had been scheduled for late September, but were postponed because the alliance could not reach a consensus.
The slow-moving pace plays into rebel hands, said political analyst Khanal.
""The longer the seven party leaders take time to reach an understanding, the more the Maoists benefit. It will give them a chance to pile on more pressure and cash in on people's frustrations at the slow pace,"" Khanal said.
While Maoist protests in the capital are a possibility, a return to full-scale war is unlikely, said Rhoderick Chalmers, deputy South Asia project director of the International Crisis Group, an organization working to prevent conflict worldwide.
""They'd try to use mass demonstrations as a calibrated tool to pressurise the government to give ground in certain areas,"" said Chalmers.
""They (the rebels) do seem to have realised that they have pushed the military campaign as far as it will go and they would be loath to sacrifice the political openings they have worked hard to develop,"" he added.
Pressure from ordinary Nepalis is another factor that could prevent a return to war, said Tribhuvan University's Shrestha.
""For the parties and the Maoists, peace is the only option. The rebels can't go back to the jungle as they have come a long way since April,"" Shrestha said.
""Plus, there's immense pressure from the Nepali people. The people have had enough of the conflict.""

"6169",2007595,"Title: UN office releases human rights report on Nepal.rtf; Date: February 22, 2007 Thursday 7:00 AM EST; Text: UN human rights office in Nepal  Thursday released a report on Nepal's human rights situation and  the office's activities in Nepal.
    Lena Sundh, representative of the United Nations Office of the  High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal (OHCHR-Nepal),  delivered a statement to mark the release of the report on Nepal  by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour.
    ""Re-establishing law and order, particularly as the Constituent Assembly elections approaches, continues to be a priority for this Office,"" The statement said.
    Arbour's report said that ""creating a climate conducive to  those elections without threats or violence will be extremely  difficult unless there is the political will on the part of all  parties to strengthen rule of law and to respect the political  rights of all,"" according to the statement. 
    The report examines the human rights situation in Nepal in the  context of the peace process up to the beginning of January 2007.  It concludes that while some improvements have been seen in the  human rights situation, major challenges still lay ahead,  including ending impunity for human rights violations and stopping the exclusion of marginalized groups.
    ""As the High Commissioner's report makes clear, addressing the  growing demands for a state structure which protects the human  rights of all and enables all Nepalese people to participate  equally in society is a fundamental challenge of the peace process and the Constituent Assembly,"" The statement said. The constituent Assembly is to be held in mid-June.
    The report has been submitted by Louise Arbour to the fourth  session of the UN Human Rights Council, which is to be held from  March 12 to April 5.
    The OHCHR was particularly asked to monitor the human rights  provisions of the Nov. 21 Comprehensive Peace Accord, signed by  the ruling Seven-party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal ( CPN) (formerly known as guerrilla).

"2159",20044419,"Title: Nepal government frees opposition leaders in sign of resolution to showdown.rtf; Date: May 3, 2004 Monday; Text: Nepal's pro-royal government Monday lifted restrictions on protests against King Gyanendra and released opposition leaders rounded up hours earlier, urging reconciliation to end a month-long showdown.
The olive branch came after at least 28 people were injured in clashes near the royal palace as police fired tear gas at stone-throwing opposition supporters demanding the king restore democratic rule.
""All people should now stop street protests so we can move ahead as we work towards elections by April next year,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters.
The opposition made its own U-turn after the day of violence, saying Girija Prasad Koirala, a three-time prime minister and key opposition leader, was ready for talks with the king, who sacked the elected government in 2002.
""Mr Koirala has agreed to see the king. The meeting will likely take place in the next couple of days,"" said a member of Koirala's Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Himalayan kingdom.
Koirala had been defiant earlier Monday as police took him into custody from his Kathmandu home, vowing to ""continue our movement to restore the people's sovereign rights.""
Thapa said Koirala was released late Monday along with five other opposition leaders detained Monday including Madhav Kumar Nepal, a communist whom the opposition has proposed for prime minister.
Meeting a key opposition demand, the home minister said all restrictions on public assembly would expire Monday.
The government banned protests April 8 saying the gatherings would be infiltrated by Maoist rebels waging a bloody anti-monarchy insurgency in the countryside.
The Maoists have expressed moral support for the protests and Madhav Kumar Nepal has said he met with the rebel leadership in November in a hotel in India to forge a potential alliance against the king.
An official close to the palace said the king, who had accused elected leaders of failing to tackle the Maoist insurgency which was launched in 1996, was ready for a compromise with the opposition.
""The king may be ready to give up his executive powers, although possibly not until new elections are held,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
The king had in late April promised elections by April 2005, infuriating the opposition which demanded the vote be held under a ""neutral"" all-party government.
Opposition leader Nepal had told a rally of 20,000 people Sunday that the opposition demanded the right to select the prime minister. The current premier is royalist Surya Bahadur Thapa, an appointee of the king.
Police also released some 1,500 people rounded up at the protest Monday near Narayanhiti Palace. Demonstration leaders had vowed a stronger campaign against the king after their leaders were taken into custody.
""By arresting our leaders, the distance between the king and the political parties has widened and we will mount our protests with a new vigour,"" Narayan Man Bijukchhe, leader of the Nepal Workers and Peasant Party, told the crowd as police carried him off.
The protest was called to mark the one-year anniversary of the opposition's pledge to oust the royalist government through demonstrations.

"7413",20118716,"Title: Strong quake hits India , Nepal ; 23 dead.rtf; Date: September 19, 2011 Monday 4:15 AM GMT; Text: The death toll from a strong earthquake in northeastern India and Nepal climbed to 23 on Monday, but police said the full extent of the damage in the remote region was not known.
The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, struck at 6:10 p.m. Sunday local time, triggering landslides, damaging buildings and sending people rushing into the streets. The epicenter was in India's Sikkim state near the border with Nepal, but shaking was felt across northern and eastern India and as far away as Bangladesh and Tibet.
At least seven people in India's Sikkim state were killed and more than 50 injured, according to the state's top official, Chief Secretary Karma Gyatso. The north Indian state of West Bengal reported six deaths, and Bihar state reported three.
Nepal's government said seven people died there, including two men and a child who were killed when a brick wall toppled outside the British Embassy in the capital, Katmandu. Nearly 70 people were injured, some of them seriously, and were in hospitals across the city.
The full extent of damage was not immediately known because the region is sparsely populated with many people living in remote areas now cut off by mudslides triggered by the quake, Sikkim state police Chief Jasbir Singh told The Associated Press.
TV stations reported buildings buckled, sidewalks cracked and two major roads collapsed in Sikkim's state capital of Gangtok, 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of the quake's epicenter near the border with Nepal. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police said two of its buildings had collapsed in Gangtok.
Small army columns fanned out across the city of some 50,000 overnight to search for anyone pinned under fallen debris.
""We have sounded a high alert. Police are on the streets in Gangtok and other major towns,"" Gyatso said.
Electricity and some phone service was interrupted in the area.
Gyatso said paramilitary soldiers worked through the night Sunday trying to clear the national highway blocked at two places due to landslides.
Power lines snapped in the West Bengal cities of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which ""are now in total darkness,"" state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said, according to Press Trust of India.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh summoned the National Disaster Management Authority for an emergency meeting.
The region has been hit by major earthquakes in the past, including in 1950 and 1897.
In neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh, the quake Sunday night sent residents rushing out of their homes, offices and shopping centers.
In Katmandu, members of Parliament who were debating the national budget ran out of the assembly hall into a parking area. They returned 15 minutes later and resumed their session.
The quake was also felt as far as the Indian capital, with New Delhi residents also rushing out of shaking buildings, and in the Chinese-ruled Himalayan region of Tibet. According to China's official Xinhua News Agency, the quake caused three houses in Tibet to collapse, injured one person and disrupted a border county's telecommunications services.
There have been at least two aftershocks of magnitude 6.1 and 5.3, Indian seismology official R.S. Dattatreyan said. He warned more aftershocks were possible.
Associated Press writers Binaj Gurubacharya in Katmandu, Nepal; Julhas Alam in Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report.

"7405",20118771,"Title: What drives a biker_.rtf; Date: March 22, 2011 Tuesday; Text: There are people who would rather live in the company of Mother Nature instead of being seen in the city lights. Sanal Nair is one of them. Whether it's riding in hilly areas with a punctured tyre for 100 km or traveling from Delhi to the mighty snowclad peaks of Leh and Ladakh, he is one guy who has certainly been there and done that.
""Help comes from unknown places and strangers you will never again meet. The feeling that there is always help waiting somewhere if you have the heart to do something drives me to unknown terrains. I'm sure bikers all over the world feel the same. Riding gives us a sense of freedom,"" says Sanal, an engineer with a bike manufacturer.
When Sanal was in Class IX, his brother gave him a bike for the motocross race. He says, ""I used a duplicate driving license for it. As time passed, my craze for speed and the thrill to explore new places kept increasing and the passion turned into a profession.""
As quoted in the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, ""When you drive a car, you look at the world through a frame. When you are riding a bike, you become the frame."" Every biker has a fascinating story to tell. Ameya Inamdar remembers a horrific experience on a ride from Leh to Manali. He was stuck for five days braving the chilly winds at Keylong as he waited for the bridge at Khokar, at the base of Rohtang, to get repaired.
When Ameya was finally allowed to cross , he recalls, ""I went ahead, with the hope that I would have a cup of garam chai and Maggi noodles at Rohtang. However, Rohtang was like a graveyard. The chilly wind numbed my fingers and the fog blinded me. When a couple of trucks passed, I couldn't utter a word for help. Finally, a Sumo driver realised my state, he followed me till Marhi, throwing his car light for support.""
After this experience, Ameya has started valuing life more. He says, ""There is nothing that we bikers wish to prove. It's a never-ending passion to ride. Biking helped me a great deal in my professional life. It has made me richer in experience, more confident and a go-getter. Each time I come back from a trip, I feel like a new man ready to take on life again!""
For documentary filmmaker Gaurav Jani, biking is about losing his identity and becoming part of the land and the people he travels to. A former assistant to director Ram Gopal Varma, he realised his dreams lay in being a biker and set off on his Enfield. During one such ride to Rajasthan, he decided to form the club 60 Kph for Indian bikers. He functioned as a one-man film unit, filming his first film Riding Solo to the Top of the World as he rode through some of the most difficult terrains in the world. Gaurav continues to go on long solo rides, recording his experiences and the thrills and spills of travel. He is out with his second flick One Crazy Ride.
For Gursaurab Singh, biking is about rediscovering the little joys of life. He started riding when he was 14 years old and got himself a Bullet when he turned 21. He got his first taste of adventure in 2003 when he rode from Delhi to Nepal and on to Arunachal Pradesh and Burma, covering a distance of 10,500 km with a team of fellow riders. Says Gursaurab, ""I'm rolling on, not really knowing where I'm going. I just know that riding gives me the means to escape to unknown places. It gives me a sense of power.""
He cautions, ""There is a famous saying among bikers - there are riders who have fallen and others who will fall. Accidents tend to happen, but we can take precautions. Most importantly, if you are going on higher attitudes, you need a good pair of socks to protect you from the cold.""
Biking helped Gursaurab become more confident and responsible. He says, ""When you're driving through no-man's land with a fellow rider who has met with an accident, your decision can save someone's life. My never-saydie attitude has helped me interact with clients and customers and has done wonders for my leather business.
According to psychiatrist Vasanta R Patri, every passion has a limit and after some years, these bikers can get exhausted, their physical health doesn't remain what it used to be or they get involved in family life. She says, ""There are reasons why these bikers drive thousands of miles on risky terrains in higher altitudes. Some are adventurous and love to face challenges, others want to test their limits and toughness while many want to do something new and different.""
She adds, ""The thrill and adventure brings out the best in a person and he becomes more confident, responsible and daring in real life. On the negative side, people going on such rides are always in danger of losing their life or a limb. The rate of failure is also high, people push themselves to extremes to achieve certain goals, but if they can't achieve them, they turn depressed and suicidal.""
Where there's a will, there's a bike!

"4692",20061166,"Title: Babloo's henchman to extortion king.rtf; Date: August 7, 2006 Monday 1:24 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Aug 7 -- FAZLUR REHMAN is in the same league as mafia dons Dawood Ibrahim, Abu Salem and Anis Ibrahim. Fazlu graduated to big league after Dawood shifted base from Dubai to Karachi, Salem shifted from Dubai to Africa, and Irfan Goga was killed. This is how the don is introduced in the Delhi Police's dossier.
  Fazlu, it says, was a small operator for Babloo Srivastava and slowly graduated to becoming a big name in extortion and kidnapping circles in Delhi, Gujarat, UP, Bihar, Mumbai and Kolkata. His operational skills, honed over the years, are reflected in the fact that he has been running simultaneous operations in Delhi with Rajkot in the west and Kolkatta in the east. School dropouts, rural bumpkins and small-time criminals are on his payrolls. Rehman, a Muslim Sheikh, was born on July 21, 1967, to Abdul Basit and Jamun in Dharbanga, Bihar. He has six brothers.
  It took a special cell team under Joint Commissioner Karnal Singh and DCP Alok Kumar months to track the don who has eluded police for the last nine years.
  Fazlu completed schooling from Millat College, Dharbanga, in 1987 and committed his first crime - kidnapping a minor girl - in 1988. He was arrested in this case and remained in jail till 1992. In jail he met notorious criminal Jameel Khan (arrested for murder in Delhi).After his release, Fazlu started collecting extortion money on behalf of Jameel from Dharbanga.
  Later, on Jameel's direction, he kidnapped a doctor, who was released after ransom was paid to Jameel. Jameel was later arrested in another case and lodged in Tihar jail in Dlehi in 1993. Fazlu would meet him at Tihar. He kidnapped one Kanwaljeet Singh on Jameel's instructions. In 1995, Fazlu was arrested in Delhi and was lodged in Tihar, where he met members of Babloo gang. After the kidnapping of Gautam Adani, there was a dispute between Jameel and Babloo on sharing of Rs 15 crore ransom. On Babloo's orders, Fazlu killed Jameel, his brother and one Chand Khan in Nepal. In 1999, he fled to Dubai on a fake Nepali passport. Fazlu had shifted base of Nepal and had kept Jameel's wife in his house.

    The guerrillas will suspend all of their armed operations on  Oct. 20-28 during the Deshain festival in Nepal, the Image FM  quoted a statement issued by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda,  supreme leader of the guerrillas, as saying.
    ""We suspend our offensive operation with immediate effect from  Oct. 20 to Oct. 28 considering the appeals and sentiments of  various human rights organizations, civic society and general  public on the eve of Dashain festival,"" Prachanda said in the  statement.
    They declare the truce for the Nepalese people to celebrate the greatest traditional festival in the Himalayan kingdom, he claimed.
    But the government hasn't answered the six questions put  forward by the guerrillas as a pre-condition to hold the peace  talks, including to write a new constitution, he added.
    The Nepali government is yet to respond to the latest move by  the guerrillas so far.
    More than 10,000 Nepalese people have lost their lives since  the anti-government insurgency broke out in the Himalayan kingdom  in early 1996.

"4618",2006737,"Title: Nepal faces mounting international criticism over crackdown.rtf; Date: April 7, 2006 Friday 5:13 AM GMT; Text: A crackdown on anti-royal protesters has sparked a new wave of international criticism against Nepal with the United States, European Union, India and Japan all voicing concern.
A four-day general strike called by opposition parties ousted when King Gyanendra took direct control 14 months ago paralysed Nepal for a second day Friday.
The opposition parties have vowed to go ahead with plans for a major rally in Kathmandu on Saturday, despite a ban on public meetings and mass arrests.
More than 300 people have been arrested for defying the ban, activists said, and arrests continued Friday morning with a dozen people taken away at a protest in the capital, an AFP reporter said.
""The arrests and harassment of pro-democracy activists violate their fundamental civil rights,"" US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington.
Powerful neighbour India called the arrests ""counter-productive,"" and called on the royal government to free the hundreds of activists detained in recent days.
""We urge the immediate release of those arrested and a return to the path of dialogue and reconciliation,"" an official government statement said Thursday.
The European Union and Japan rasied similar concerns, calling on Gyanendra's government to allow peaceful protests, stop the arrests and free those already detained.
Rights group Amensty International called on the goverment to halt the arrests.
""Targeting leaders of the peaceful political opposition is not only wrong, it is dangerous,"" said Purna Sen, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific Director.
""Squeezing the space for legitimate political activity heightens the risk of violent confrontation and human rights abuse,"" Sen said.
UN chief Kofi Annan on Wednesday urged the Kathmandu authorities not to deny citizens their right to peaceful protest and expressed concern as the arrests started.
Last November, Nepal's rebel Maoists formed a loose alliance with the sidelined political parties, further isolating King Gyanendra, the world's last Hindu monarch.
Since the rebels began their ""people's war"" in 1996, at least 12,500 people have been killed.

The rebels bombed the police post at Lubhu, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Katmandu during the early hours of Tuesday, a senior police officer said on customary condition of anonymity.
No one was wounded in the attack, the officer said, adding that the post was unoccupied. Police moved to a different location earlier in the week because of security risks.
Police were hunting for the attackers in the area, he said.
The rebels - who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong - have been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's monarchy.
The violence has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government in February, a measure he said was necessary to quell the insurgency, which has left more than 11,500 dead.

Baburam Bhattarai, second-in-command of the rebel group, appeared before reporters with four key colleagues. It was his first public appearance since the rebels began their violent campaign in 1996 to end the constitutional monarchy in this Himalayan kingdom.
""Instead of creating a conducive environment for the peace talks, the ruling side has been involved in acts that could disrupt the talks,"" Bhattarai told a crowded press conference in the capital Katmandu.
""We have taken a big risk to come out in the open because we are sincere and serious about finding a peaceful resolution to the problem,"" said Bhattarai, who arrived in Katmandu on Friday but had avoided the public and media.
Bhattarai said government troops were harassing rebel supporters, preventing them from holding peaceful gatherings and meetings, and was delaying the release of rebel supporters still in custody.
He said the rebels were ready for the talks and would like them to begin immediately.
""The talks will succeed,"" Bhattarai said.
On Friday, government peace negotiator Narayan Singh Pun, who is minister for physical planning, said the two sides would hold an introductory meeting on Tuesday.
It is expected to last one day. The two sides would be formally introduced and decide when to meet again to discuss key issues, officials say.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They are demanding an interim government and an election for a new constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.
The rebels decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
During previous peace talks in 2001, rebel negotiators and government ministers met three times. The rebels accused the government of being inflexible and withdrew from the talks.
Following the failed talks, the rebels launched attacks on government targets that prompted King Gyanendra to impose a state of emergency in November 2001. Emergency rule was lifted in August.

""The strike has affected over one million students in 5,500 schools and colleges in the Bagmati and Narayani zones which comprise 24 districts of the country's 75 districts,"" an education ministry official said.
The strike was called by the All Nepal National Independent Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) to demand the authorities reveal the fate of 152 students arrested after a ceasefire between the government and Maoist rebels broke down on August 27. They were arrested for ""Maoist activities.""
""We don't know whether they are still safe or killed by the security while in detention,"" a student source said.
The Private and Boarding School Association-Nepal (PABSON) said many institutions had decided to shut down for five days, fearing attacks if they stayed open.
Earlier this month the ANNISU-R enforced a three-day strike in eastern Nepal which closed hundreds of schools and colleges.
The union says it also wants the government to implement an agreement reached with it last year, including giving free education to all students until the age of 16.

Text of report published by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 17 February
Nepalgunj [town in mid-western Nepal], 16 February [Monday]: Just as in the eastern Terai [southern plains of the country], the west is also witnessing a day-by-day rise in the number of armed groups. Incidents of [forced] donation terror, issuing of threats and abductions are also on the increase. 
Meanwhile, a new armed group has emerged in Banke [district in mid-western Nepal], claiming to have shot Shakti Bahadur Basnet, the prime minister's personal secretary and politburo member of the Unified Maoist party, and to have attacked the police post in Pyuthan [district in the mid-western region]. 
A new armed group, which calls itself the Defence Nepal of Trishul [trident] Army and claims that the two incidents were perpetrated under the command of their central commander Surajit, has now emerged. 
Just two days earlier, an armed group calling itself the Bhishan Himali Bagh [Raging Himalayan Tiger] emerged to take responsibility for the bomb blast that occurred at the Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Nepalgunj. 
In a communique issued to media people on Sunday [15 February], the Defence Nepal Trishul Army, which styles itself in favour of monarchy, claimed responsibility for the attack on the police post in Pyuthan and the physical attack on the prime minister's personal secretary. The communique is targeted at various individuals and organizations in Banke District in an interesting fashion. It says they were associated with various incidents, and warned of revenge and physical action. Issued in the name of the supreme commander Chandra Kant, it also says that the group is active in Dang, Banke, Bardiya and Kailali districts [along the southern belt in mid- and far-western Nepal]. The group, which has not come to public notice before this, claims to have been involved in armed activities for the past two years. 
Some time back donation terror in the name of various groups had been rife in Banke District. 
Rights workers in Banke had been repeatedly drawing the attention of the local administration towards the need to control the donation terror and to confiscate illegal arms. 
Meanwhile, various individuals released as prisoners of conscience after being arrested on different charges have also been creating terror in the rural areas.

"1930",20044291,"Title: Maoists open to talks to end Nepal bloodshed.rtf; Date: December 20, 2004 Monday 11:10 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebel leader offered hope Monday of breaking a deadlock on talks to settle the kingdom's bloody insurgency that has killed more than 10,000 people since 1996.
The rebel chief said Maoists were ready to meet political parties if it could lead to mediated talks with the king's representatives on the constitutional role of the monarchy and army.
In a rare question and answer exchange, Puspa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachand, denied to the Nepali-language daily Samacharpatra that he only wanted direct talks with the king, who is head of state and controls the Royal Nepalese Army.
""We have never said we are ready to hold talks only with the king,"" Prachand said of efforts to end the bloodshed.
The government has said if the rebels do not come to the negotiating table by January 13 it would press ahead with long-awaited parliamentary elections.
The Maoists want any negotiations to include their call for elections for an assembly to draft a new constitution that eventually envisages ousting the monarchy and setting up a communist state.
They have threatened to sabotage any polls that are not held to elect a constituent assembly.
A political solution could come from negotiations with fully mandated representatives of the king as head of the country and army, the Maoist leader said.
""What we said should not be misinterpreted,"" said Prachand, which means ""fiery one"".
His comments coincide with a surge in violence, with 141 people including Maoists, soldiers and civilians killed in the past week, ahead of the government deadline for the rebels to resume peace talks.
A strike called by a pro-Maoist group closed schools and slowed transport Monday in the Kathmandu valley.
The rebels are battling to oust the constitutional monarchy led by King Gyanendra.
King Gyanendra named Sher Bahadur Deuba as premier in June with a mandate to hold peace talks with the rebels and stage general elections by mid-May in 2005.
""Our policy mainly aims at forging solidarity with the political parties battling against anti-democratic forces and thereby compel the king to find a political way,"" Prachand said.
However, he ruled out the possibility of holding talks with any representative of the king without preconditions.
""We think it would be pointless to hold talks with anyone's representative without first agreeing on reliable and acceptable mediation or on widely acclaimed democratic procedures,"" he said.
He also said he saw a bleak prospect of holding peace talks with the Deuba-led four-party coalition government.
""As the Deuba-led government has done such things as increasing the budgetary appropriation of the feudal palace and enforced the Terrorist and Destructive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance (TADO) it does not stand a chance of holding the peace talks,"" he said.
The Maoists have refused to negotiate with the present government, describing it ""as without appropriate mandate, and demanding constituent assembly elections to redraft Nepal's democratic constitution.""
""If the Deuba-led government has any capability to hold the peace talks, it should not have any difficulty in deciding on reliable international mediation and on the procedures of constituent assembly election,"" he said.
The crux of the matter hinges on how to make the people sovereign and about the future of the old regime and the overall structure of its army, he said.
""As elections in the present context are nothing but a part of reactionary plot, we are determined to foil it,"" he said.

Both countries would achieve new heights during my tenure,"" said Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known as Prachand, after returning from the Asia's highest 2400 MW Tehri hydel project at Jolly Grants Airport in Dehradun on Friday.
He was received by Chief Minister Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri, who presented him a shawl in his honour.
""A lot of hydropower potential has been identified in Nepal. We would like to develop more power projects with India. Why Pancheshwar only?"" Prachanda told reporters at Jolly Grant Airport after visiting Tehri dam where he had thorough discussions with the Tehri dam officials.
Indicating towards changed political scenario in his country, he said Nepal and India would work jointly in other fields also with an aim to develop the region. When asked whether Nepal would prefer dam based power projects or run-of-the-river projects, Prachanda said his country would build both.
The Rs 30,000-crore Pancheshwar dam, which is proposed on the river Mahakali on Uttarakhand-Nepal border, has a lot of similarities with Tehri dam which displaced over one lakh people. Earlier in the day, Prachanda travelled to the 2400-MW Tehri dam site on a chopper. He also went inside the powerhouse and showed keen interest in the functioning of the plant. Prachanda said he went there to study various aspects of the hydel project.
Prachanda's visit to Uttarakhand is expected to give a new lease of life to Pancheshwar dam which is hanging fire since the last one decade especially in the wake of Maoist violence in the neighbouring nation. India and Nepal held a series of meetings related to the dam and also decided to set up a Pancheshwar Development Authority.
During his brief stay, he visited Asia's highest 2400 MW Tehri hydel project and discussed to the officials on issues like displacement and rehabilitation of people due to the power project. The 6000-MW Pancheshwar dam, which is supposed to be built over the Mahakali river, is likely to submerge a large chunk of land. Tehri hydro power project officials gave power point presentation to the dignitaries.

""There is need for a much higher level of engagement with neighbouring countries,"" said former Foreign Secretary Shashank, ""because their internal problems directly impact on us.""
  Also, an analyst said, Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri would not be able to crib, as there will be a counterpart with whom he can interact directly. Combating terrorism and the formulation of a joint mechanism against terror with Pakistan are other key areas the new external affairs minister will need to focus on. Other areas include a high-level meeting of aid donors for Afghanistan in November. Also in November, the US administration will aim to schedule a crucial Senate vote for the Indo-US civil nuclear deal to go through.
  Discussions with members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group will have to be followed up simultaneously, to ensure India returns to the international nuclear mainstream as soon as possible. High-level visits, including those of Chinese President Hu Jintao in November and Russian President Vladimir Putin in January, will require crucial monitoring by Mukherjee. ""Morale in the foreign office needs to be raised,"" Shashank said.

"3675",20052625,"Title: With Rebels Roaming Nepal , Tourism Plunges.rtf; Date: July 3, 2005 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final
BEFORE setting out from Katmandu, Nepal's capital, for a trekking trip in the countryside in February, Amber Manners got a practical tip. If you see guerillas on the road, she was warned, do as they say, even if they ask you to get off your bus. ''If they burn your bus,'' she recalled being told, ''they'll ask you to get off first.''
 Sure enough, Ms. Manners, 23, from Brisbane, Australia, did see five scorched buses lying on the side of a road as she made the trip out of the capital and into the hills. And on the third morning of her trek, she did meet the guerillas, but not in the manner she had expected. When a man came walking up behind her, she mistook him for a local resident, peddling tourist kitsch. ''Excuse me, excuse me,'' he said, as Ms. Manners recalled. She replied ''No, no, we don't need anything.'' Then he said, ''We are with the Maoist party.''
  The stranger was peddling tourist kitsch of a certain sort. In exchange for the requisite tax that the Maoists impose on trekkers -- she paid $1.50, at 65 Nepali rupees to the dollar -- Ms. Manners returned from her trek with a receipt from the rebels: it was stamped with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and, of course, Mao. 
 If Nepal once marketed itself as a land out of time, a Himalayan kingdom inhabited by yaks and yetis, a Maoist uprising in the hills and a royal clampdown on political protests in tourist-friendly Katmandu has certainly tweaked that image. ''The kingdom has long exerted a pull on the Western imagination,'' according to the Lonely Planet Web site, in a prelude to its travel warning on Nepal. ''Check travel advisories for possible bandhs (strikes) that may be called at short notice. If a bandh is called, do not travel during it and keep an extra low profile until it is over.''
 The hardy continue to flock to Nepal to bask in its stark natural beauty, tour its ancient monuments, see elephants in the wild, and, increasingly, fetch a rebel receipt for their scrapbooks. But a nine-year insurgency and the state of emergency declared on Feb. 1 by King Gyanendra has radically crimped tourism in Nepal. Last month, two bus bombings killed dozens of people. 
 The United States and many countries in Europe have warned their citizens against traveling to Nepal. And even though emergency rule was officially lifted at the end of April, the travel warnings remain, as do a host of political restrictions imposed by the king. The United States renewed its warning last month. Small clashes continue, and the Maoists continue to deploy their key weapon -- strikes that can shut down huge swaths of the country for tourists and locals alike. 
 In the first four months of this year, a period that covers the peak spring tourist season, Nepal logged roughly 72,000 tourists, a reduction of 34 percent from the same period last year, according to the Nepal Tourism Bureau.
 The number of tourists from India, who have long been drawn to Nepal's temples, mountains and casinos, fell by 37 percent in the same period. Last month, Nepal sweetened the pot with a package for Indian citizens: Fantastic Family Offer, it was called, and it came with a free fourth ticket for every three tickets purchased, and casino coupons worth nearly $200. 
 The Tourism Board has also tried to lure back trekkers, slashing fees by half -- to about $5,000 for a team of seven -- for some prime peaks, including the 28,169-foot Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain.
 Government tourism officials have pitched the notion that Nepal, after King Gyanendra's emergency proclamation, is safer than ever before. And tour group operators have had to refine their intelligence about safety in the field, and pump out that message to stay afloat. ''We've had to grind out this mantra that things aren't that bad,'' said David Jones, director of Himalayan Encounters, an upscale trekking and tour company. ''It's fantastic value at the moment.'' 
 The Maoist insurgents, who have been fighting the government since 1996, officially welcome foreign tourists. In the parts of the hilly countryside where they roam freely, tolls on individual tourists, lodges and other tourism-related industries generate what are believed to be substantial revenues, although these are impossible to quantify. A hotel chain owner reported to having paid close to $9,000 in 2003 as extortion money to the Maoists. In short, there is no question that local people are at far greater risk than any visible foreigner. 
 Nevertheless, many foreigners have kept their distance. Peace Corps activities were suspended last September. Nonessential members of the United States Embassy's staff pulled out of Katmandu last September, but began returning the following month. Because the United States government lists the Maoist rebel group as a terrorist organization, American citizens are forbidden to contribute funds, goods, or services to, or for the benefit of the Maoists, according to the State De"

Excerpt from news report headlined ""People's army integration into all security bodies"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 17 October
Kathmandu, 16 October: Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) has said preparations are being made to integrate the people's liberation army into all the security bodies of the state including the Nepal army.
""The people's liberation army can be integrated in the Nepal police, the armed police, the security force to be set up for industrial, border and forest area security and the investigation department also"", Prachanda said to media persons who had gone to meet him at his residence on Thursday [16 October], ""The people's liberation army will be integrated into all those areas"".
He said that in the course of preparing a model for restructuring the security sector, an overall security policy would be worked out under which arrangements would be made for the army, the civil and armed police, the investigation department and the force to be set up for industrial, border and forest area security.
""The integration will be carried out as per the wishes of the people's liberation army"", he said in response to a question from a journalist, ""For those who want to leave the army and take up politics, arrangements will be made accordingly"". He disclosed that the coming cabinet meeting will form a special committee for army integration and the integration process then taken forward.
Stating that he was astonished at the controversial statements being made from various quarters about integration, he said that since the comprehensive peace accord mentions army integration and rehabilitation, the process would be taken forward accordingly. [Passage omitted: clarification of what the foreign minister said about integration]
In reply to another question, Prachanda said a special committee would work out the criteria for army integration.
Since then prime minister and Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala also signed the comprehensive peace accord with its points on army integration and rehabilitation, there was no need for any further controversy, Prachanda said.
[Passage omitted: other matters]
Stating that consensus remained to be worked out among the parties only on the federal structure, he said there is already consensus on other issues. [Passage omitted: other issues]

Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal where they discussed the Tibetan protests and other issues, Dahal's spokesman Hira Bahadur Thapa said.
""The Chinese foreign minister said China appreciates Nepal's alertness and role in controlling anti-China protests,"" Thapa told reporters after the meeting.
""China also urged Nepal to continue with the policy,"" he said.
Nepalese authorities banned anti-China protests by Tibetan exiles in the months preceding the Beijing Olympic Games in August and detained hundreds of protesters.
Tibetan exiles in Nepal staged almost daily protests in March to show their support for the unrest that erupted in Tibet's capital, Lhasa. The demonstrations were among the biggest in almost 50 years of Chinese rule.
Beijing clamped down with a huge mobilization of paramilitary police. China's government said 22 died in the violence, while supporters of Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama said the death toll was 140.
Many Tibetans insist they had an independent nation before Chinese communist troops invaded in 1950. Beijing says the Himalayan region has been part of China's territory for centuries.
""Nepal is an excellent neighbor, friend and partner of China,"" the Chinese minister said in brief remarks after the meeting.

"1428",20045093,"Title: Asian free trade deal jeopardised as Bangladesh pulls out.rtf; Date: February 7, 2004 Saturday; Text: The signing of a free trade deal among South and Southeast Asian nations was thrown into doubt Saturday as Bangladesh withdrew after demanding compensation in return for abolishing tariffs, officials and sources said.
Thai Commerce Minister Watana Muangsook announced at the opening of the BIMSTEC ministerial talks on this Thai resort island that the deal was to be inked on Sunday after agreement was reached among member nations.
BIMSTEC's more developed members, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, were expected to pledge to cut tariffs to zero by 2012 while the two less-developed members, Bangladesh and Myanmar, were to be given an additional five years.
However, sources said the discussions hit a roadblock when the Bangladesh delegation, led by a civil servant after Trade Minister Manjur Morshed Khan fell ill, insisted they be compensated for any losses incurred.
""Bangladesh is not in a position to sign,"" Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow confirmed.
""Bangladesh did not want to be an obstacle to the signing of the agreement so they said -- you go ahead and sign and we can join later,"" he told reporters.
With only four of the seven-nation bloc now able to join the deal, BIMSTEC foreign ministers meeting here Sunday will discuss whether they should now aim instead for all seven members to sign at a summit planned for July, he said.
Incoming members Nepal and Bhutan were not part of the trade negotiations and had already been invited to join at a later date.
Sources at the talks said delegates were ""flummoxed"" by Bangladesh's proposal which they said did not outline in detail how they would be compensated.
They said that other member nations, particularly Sri Lanka which has already agreed on a free trade deal with India, tried unsuccessfully to convince them that their concerns could be addressed within the agreement.
In upbeat opening comments before the controversy blew up, Watana said the deal would unleash the ""enormous potential and resources"" of the region of 1.3 billion people, which had so far gone largely untapped.
""I am convinced that our success in establishing the free trade area will greatly increase both our inter-regional and intra-regional trade,"" he said.
Watana also took a swipe at Western nations, saying that while they promoted free trade they raised protectionist tariffs that diminished purchasing power for their own products, and that Asian nations should not follow their example.
""Has uncontrolled self-interest blinded all rational decisions? Have benefits from free trade been blurred by greed? We do not wish to fall into this trap,"" he said.
Sihasak said the foreign ministers' talks would focus on establishing a common position on terrorism, and finding ways to cooperate to fight infectious diseases like the bird flu which has swept across Asia.
""It's been agreed that we need to work closer together on terrorism and transnational crime, and infectious diseases like SARS and bird flu. The foreign ministers will discuss how to take this further,"" he said.
""I think they will recognise that the challenge now is not just the traditional security issues.""
The bird flu outbreak has killed 18 people in Vietnam and Thailand and emerged in poultry in eight other Asian nations, only a year after the SARS epidemic caused panic as it swept the region.
BIMSTEC leaders were originally due to meet here Monday for the grouping's first summit, but those plans were postponed when Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee cancelled his trip.
BIMSTEC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- Economic Cooperation) was initiated seven years ago by Thailand as part of its ""look West"" policy.

 The Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) said in a statement that the policy change was agreed during a recent politburo meeting.
 The promise came a day after a government army soldier was killed and eight injured when their truck drove over a land mine that Maoist rebels are suspected of setting, while government troops killed 24 rebels in weekend clashes across the kingdom.
The statement, signed by Maoist leader Prachanda and distributed to the local Nepalese media Tuesday evening, said Maoist militia will refrain from attacking workers of rival political parties, junior police and army officers on leave as well as their family members.
 The Maoists said they will stop sabotaging bridges, airports, telecom towers, and sites of natural heritage.
 Nepalese and international non-government organizations (NGOs), except those directly run by the 'American imperialists,' would be spared from attacks by the Maoist militia, the party said. Instead, the rebels would try to work with the NGOs in the rural areas where they claim to have complete control.
 Following the collapse of peace talks in late August, the Maoist rebels have bombed a score of police outposts, training centers, and infrastructures such as roads and bridges.
 Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa said Monday the government would wage an all-out war against the rebels.
 No leniency would be shown to the rebels if they continued with their acts of rampage, he told a public meeting in the Parsa district of southwestern Nepal.

"2850",20044018,"Title: A Haitian Village Gets a Barrage of Care.rtf; Date: May 31, 2004 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final
The awful truth is that life in this ruined patch of Haiti may be better now than it has ever been, or will ever be again.
 Doctors and nurses treated the sick and wounded on Sunday in a shack that passed for a clinic. Hulking American helicopters delivered tons of food. People with money and power -- aid workers and American soldiers -- attended to Mapou.
 For the first time, and perhaps the last, someone strong is looking after the people of Mapou and its outlying hamlets. The people here lost as many as 1,670 of their friends, neighbors and relatives in the floods that have destroyed swaths of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to one Red Cross official in Mapou on Sunday, Erich Baumann.
 The 1,900 American soldiers in Haiti -- and their helicopters, now Mapou's lifeline -- will start leaving the country on Tuesday. They will all be gone in a month.
 About 1,500 of them are marines based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. More than 1,000 of them were scheduled to go to Iraq in August. Some may take a bit more time to rest, retool and retrain, but almost all will head to Baghdad and beyond by year's end.
 The Haitian government has about $3 per person to help the estimated 75,000 people affected by the flood. With so little money to aid Mapou's survivors, the government may force them to move. Many of the survivors say they might as well leave forever.
 ''This land is cursed,'' said Lilie Jean-Baptiste, 26, who like most of her neighbors had willed a living out of the earth, growing a little cassava, buying rice and beans when she scraped a dollar or two together. ''Mapou is over.''
 Marcberth St.-Louis, 21, is the son of dirt farmers who dreamed of a better life abroad someday. Mr. St.-Louis, who speaks fluent French, Creole, Spanish and a little English, said: ''For many people here, life is finished. People loved their little piece of land but it's all gone now.''
 Raymond Delaba, 15, a survivor of the torrent that took Mapou and now the sole support for his six younger brothers and sisters, said: ''It's just impossible to survive here, with or without the flood. My parents are gone. My house is gone. Our pigs and goats are gone. How am I going to survive? Are we going to eat a handful of rice out of a bag from abroad for the rest of our lives?''
 This is what life was like before the flood in Mapou and its six surrounding hamlets -- one of which, Barrois, was completely destroyed:
 As in most of Haiti's villages, the average income here is a dollar a day or less. Last year, a drought shriveled the corn. For Christmas, fate gave Mapou a flash flood. During and after the February revolt that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the price of rice -- the staff of life for Haitians -- rose 50 percent in Mapou. That meant 50 percent less to eat, Mapou's survivors said.
 No leader of Haiti has ever visited Mapou, the people said. ''For the poor, there is no government,'' Ms. Jean-Baptiste said. ''The only government of Haiti is God.''
 Now, starting June 1, a coalition of foreign soldiers cobbled together by the United Nations will begin to replace the American-led force that occupied Haiti after the fall of Mr. Aristide, who flew to exile in South Africa on Sunday.
 It is unclear that this force will have the organization, money or equipment to deal with the emergencies of food, medicine and shelter facing survivors of the flood, who will need help for months to come.
 The force is supposed to include soldiers from Brazil, China, France, Argentina, Nepal, Bangladesh, Uruguay and the Philippines. But it remains largely a force on paper, though a ceremony beginning the transfer is to take place on Tuesday and the new United Nations force is set to assume command on June 20.
 The question is what happens to the people of Mapou when the world's fleeting attention -- and the American soldiers -- move on.
 The same might be asked of the people of nearby Fond Verrettes, where the dead and missing now number close to 200, and Jimani, just over the border in the Dominican Republic, where more than 700 are dead or missing. No one has counted the dead in two small floodstruck Haitian towns, Nan Galet and Boulou, but unofficially the toll in both nations is now well over 2,000.
 The United Nations is already running more than a few major operations in places like Liberia, where thousands of peacekeepers patrol a devastated country. The world's aid agencies are struggling to handle a world of crises, many man-made, in places like Afghanistan. The charitable responses of the world's governments to Haiti have been far less than the United Nations sought.
 So the withdrawal of American forces will not help Haiti cope with its latest disaster.
 The American military began arriving Feb. 29, the day President Aristide fell, as the capital, Port-au-Prince, was stormed by armed rebels calling for a return of the notorious Haitian Army he ha"
"6257",2007156,"Title: Feature_ Delayed celebration of Children's Day in Nepal by Rajeeb Tamrakar, Chen Qiaoyan.rtf; Date: June 2, 2007 Saturday 12:00 PM EST; Text: Despite being weekend holiday  throughout Nepal on Saturday, students of New-town Children's  School in Kathmandu gathered in their school premises to  participate in a program organized to mark the International  Children's Day (ICD) celebrated on June 1 every year.
    The International Children's Day had its origin in the World  Conference for the Wellbeing of Children in Geneva, Switzerland in 1925.
    The reason they could not be the part of ICD celebration held  throughout the world on June 1 was that almost all the schools  throughout the country remained closed due to the general strike  organized by various groups calling to fulfill their demands.
    Talking to Xinhua on Saturday, Ramesh Pradhan, a child rights  activist said, ""It is direct violation of the rights of children."" Referring to the recent shut-down of schools by the teachers  throughout the country, Pradhan maintains that children's rights  to education in Nepal is being directly violated at the moment.  Some 8 million children were directly affected as the school  teachers throughout the country shut down some 35,000 schools for  more than one week with various demands. 
    However, there are various organizations working in  collaboration with the government for the wellbeing of the  children in the country like Nepal which had been ravaged by a  decade-long armed conflict that obstructed social and economic  development of the country as a whole.
    After the current government was formed on April 1, 2007  comprising seven party alliance along with the Communist Party of  Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M), the concerned authorities are facing  numerous challenges in the area of children's welfare in the  country.
    Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Women, Children and Social  Welfare Mahendra Prasad Shrestha told Xinhua that the Ministry is  currently drafting new Acts Related to Children as the Act that  was formulated in the year 1991-92 has become irrelevant at  present circumstances.
    Joint Secretary Shrestha said that the government is working to draft policies and facilitate in collaboration with public  organizations.
    Talking about recent initiatives taken by the government, he  said that the government is currently supporting some 57 children  in four different districts by providing financial assistance of  nearly 20 U.S. dollars every month to the conflict affected  children. Admitting that the number is very few, he, however,  expressed optimism to increase the number in near future. 
    Similarly, the Central Children Welfare Committee has been  working on toll free numbers: 104 for inquiry about the missing  children inside the Kathmandu Valley and 1098 as a help line.
    The Government of Nepal has also suspended the ""Inter-country  Adoption"" at the moment as the Ministry is working towards  introducing a new policy related to adoption of children by  foreign citizens within one month.
    Stressing on the need to encourage coordination between the  locals and the government authorities for the welfare of children, Shrestha said that there are some 6,000 to 7,000 Children's Clubs  working throughout the country for the welfare of children and to  safeguard their rights. 
    He also relates a recent incident in which members of local  Children's Club thwarted the marriage between under-aged children  in one of the remote districts of Nepal.
    While talking about the growing number of street children in  the country, Joint Secretary Shrestha said that even the concerned authorities are facing the problem due to ""resource gap"" and could not determine the exact data. The Central Children Welfare  Committee is currently setting up a database to determine the  exact number of street children in the country and other  information regarding the status children under different  circumstances.
    Although the government could not confirm the exact number of  street children in the country at the moment, through the  statistics provided by Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), some 3,000-5,000 children are living in the streets of Kathmandu only. 
    Meanwhile, among various NGOs, the Child Protection Centers and Services (CPCS), a local NGO, is currently working with and for  the hundreds of street and working children in Nepal living under  very difficult circumstances and generally deprived of any social  support after it was established in July 2002 and was later  registered with the government of Nepal in 2004.
    According to Arjun Mohan Bhattarai, the administration manager  of the CPCS, they are currently working with two objectives- risk  reduction which includes short term actions to reduce the dangers  of ""street life"" and social rehabilitation for long term plans to  reintegrate the child back into society.
    The CPCS claims that they are supporting up to 350 children  through field activities while 350 to 400 children are sheltered  in two of the ""socialization shelters"" they are operatin"

About 100 journalists pushed through a line of police officers who tried to stop them, saying that the demonstrators were violating a ban on public assemblies.
Baton-wielding riot police later arrested more than two dozen of the journalists and detained them at a local police station. It was not immediately clear if they would be charged.
""It was a peaceful protest. They had no right or reason to arrest and treat journalists like this,"" Rishi Dhamala of the Reporter's Club Nepal said while still in custody.
Journalist Gyanendra Khadka, a reporter for state-run Rastriya Samachar Samiti news agency, was killed at Melamchi village, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of the capital, Katmandu, on Sunday.
Police said they suspect the rebels were responsible for his killing. The assailants took Khadka to a field near a school where he taught part-time, tied his hands and slashed his throat.
A motive for the killing was not known. The rebels rarely claim, or comment on, their actions and have been in hiding since they broke off from a peace process last month and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.
The rebels, who say they're inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have sought since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.

"4350",2006866,"Title: RAY OF HOPE IN NEPAL.rtf; Date: April 27, 2006 Thursday 1:51 AM  EST; Text: GUWAHATI, April 27 -- A semblance of normality, but only just, has returned to Nepal following King Gyanendra's televised announcement of reinstating the kingdom's Parliament that was dissolved on May 22, 2002. Coming after days of violent demonstrations against the monarchy, which has led to several deaths and numerous injuries, the announcement has led the seven-party political alliance to withdraw their agitation. But the decision of the rebel Maoists to reject the King's offer has come as a major setback to hopes of lasting peace in the beleaguered country sandwiched between India and China. In a statement on Tuesday, the Maoists termed the king's offer to reinstate Parliament as a ploy to defuse the agitation and vowed to continue with the protests through countrywide rallies and economic blockades. For once, the seven party alliance has been put in a quandary as to what it should do next. 
The agitation it launched, was primarily demanding the restoration of democracy. The King has done his bit, by first asking the alliance to nominate a Prime Minister and now reconvening Parliament next Friday. The Maoists, who joined the popular demonstrations, have set themselves higher goals--that of establishing a republic and the formation of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution. Though the King, in his address to the nation, made no specific mention of elections, the fact that Parliament is being restored suggests that elections will be held in the near future.
  The seven-party alliance had signed a 12-point pact with the Maoists, some months earlier, agreeing to work together for the ""restoration of democracy"" though the actual shape of that democratic structure was left undefined. Signs of difference in opinion have now emerged with the Maoists stating that the seven-party alliance has committed a blunder by welcoming the King's proclamation. The rebels have urged the people to continue the agitation with the ultimate aim to depose the monarchy. The rebels have already announced their plans to intensify the people's agitation. It has confirmed the worst fears expressed by several quarters, including the King, who had predicted that the rebels would ultimately usurp the agitation to further their goals. It may be noted that the United States had month's earlier appealed to the seven-party alliance to withdraw from the pact with the Maoists. The coming few weeks will be critical for the country and may see widening of the chasm between the Maoist rebels and the mainstream parties. It will be a major disappointment for the people of Nepal who had dreamed of democratic bliss once the King restored democratic rights to them. Yet another problem that is likely to crop up soon is the fight for power within the seven-party alliance itself. With the restoration of parliamentary democracy, the grand alliance has lost the glue that bound them together. 
  India, meanwhile, is faced with a dilemma. With the seven-party alliance welcoming King Gyanendra's latest offer, it is clear that the King has made his way back to the good books of the parties, even if temporarily. On the other hand the Maoist stand suggests that the honeymoon between the rebels and the parties is over. It is India that played the key role in bringing the two anti-King forces together. Officially, India has hailed the restoration of multiparty democracy and handing over of political power calling it as a victory of the people of Nepal. Its silence on the Maoist stand is proof enough of its doubts about lasting peace in the Himalayan kingdom. It is a doubt shared by many. The Maoist rebels had a ghastly record of violence even when the political parties wielded power in Nepal. So far over 13,000 people have been killed since the rebellion began over a decade ago. The kingdom is set for more violence in the days to come, democracy or no democracy. The rebels already control a large part of the country and it has the strength to extend its sway. The trouble for Indian diplomacy has only just begun. After drawing the King's ire by openly supporting the anti-monarchy demonstrations that included the Maoists, India will have to pay attention to the Maoist rebellion in its northern neighbourhood while battling Maoists at home as well. The Nepal Maoists have been advocating the abrogation of the Indo-Nepal friendship treaty. Their growing influence in Nepalese affairs does not bode well for the relations between the two countries.

 It has been confirmed that tourists in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACAP) ""did not turn back mid-way"" despite the area being affected by the ""search operation"" of the security forces and the ""donation terror"" of the Maoists.
 A few days back there were reports that due to the security forces and Maoists' terror, tourists who have gone to areas like Tatopani, Ghandruk and Poon Hill were looted and returning mid-way.
 But according to the survey conducted by the Trekking Agents' Association of Nepal (TAAN) in that tourist area, no such untoward activities took place. The ""regional chapter"" of TAAN, located in Pokhara, has claimed that to date no tourists in that area have turned back. Rather the tourists, instead of going through the usual trekking route, are taking alternative routes, the chapter informed.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 Oct 03 p1
""Sometimes, the security forces and Maoists are not both in that area,"" TAAN chairman Deepak Mahat said, adding: ""Tourists are arriving in the Annapurna area without any hindrance.""
 Referring to the observation made by people of Ghandruk one of the villages in the Annapurna Circuit trekking route , he said that even they were stunned by such information i.e. presumably suggestions that trekkers were avoiding the area .
 TAAN's regional office, situated in Birethati the gateway to the Annapurna trekking route , said that tourists are moving towards their destinations. ""It is true that the army's presence has dispersed the Maoists,"" said Mahat, the chairman of TAAN.
 The negative information concerning the Annapurna area could affect the annual 35 per cent tourist influx, the entrepreneurs pointed out. According to them, 35 per cent of tourists who visit Nepal come to travel in the Annapurna area. According to TAAN, even after the Maoists broke the truce unilaterally and resumed their violence, tourist arrivals have not been affected.
 While the condition of tourists going through travel agencies is positive, the actual condition of those who have gone on their own has not come to their notice, said TAAN.
 In the Annapurna area, some unscrupulous persons, in the name of the Maoists, are indulging in activities like collecting donations from the tourists, behaving rudely to them, beating them and turning them back mid-way, the tourist entrepreneurs said.
 According to the entrepreneurs, the Maoists have not asked the tourists for donations with a view to create terror. ""It was found that whatever the tourists gave willingly, the Maoists willingly accepted it,"" said Mahat.
 TAAN, referring to what Denis, a Spanish tourist going towards Poon Hill from Ghodepani said, said only a day earlier the army had intensified its search operation. Even the American embassy in Kathmandu said such activities are widespread around the world and expressed its belief that tourists would not be affected that adversely.  passage omitted

 The three-day Regional Conference on Poverty Reduction Strategies brings together delegates from Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, East Timor and Vietnam and observers from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka.
The forum, sponsored by development agencies that include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund, the U.N. Development Program and the World Bank, will focus on three major themes -- governance, 'pro-poor' growth, and the challenges of linking specific development goals with strategies that are seen as key factors in Asia's fight against poverty.
 The conference centers on sharing country experience with poverty reduction.
 In an opening address, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told participants his government sees the war on poverty as 'not just a policy, but a passion.'
 'We still have a long way to go and will encounter countless obstacles. We all must recognize that we cannot solve all the issues of poverty in one day or one month or one year,' he said.
 Cambodia is among the world's poorest countries, with about 30% of its 13 million people earning less than $1 a day.
 And with a population of 1.8 billion, East Asia and the Pacific is one of the world's largest developing regions where in 2000 about 261 million people lived on less than $1 a day.
 But the ADB expects regional development initiatives will reduce that number to about 80 million by 2015.

The changes, to be implemented over the next three years, will be instrumental in promoting rights and equality for women, said Shashi Kant Mainali, a top official in the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare.
The announcement comes a day after a female wing of Nepal's Maoist rebel movement called a general strike to mark International Women's Day and to protest the abuse of women in this Himalayan nation. Schools and businesses were closed across the country.
Though Nepal's constitution outlaws sexual discrimination, there are dozens of laws that disadvantage women, including on matters of property ownership, citizenship, marriage, employment and education.
The government will redraft each law that discriminates against women, Mainali said.
New laws will be enacted that require all political parties to nominate women as at least a third of their candidates in elections, from district level to national. They also will require all government departments to have a minimum of a third of their work force as women, Mainali said.
Details of the proposed laws were not released, including a timetable for their implementation.
Women currently make up about 8 percent of the government work force. The percentage of women in politics is not clear because Nepal's king suspended parliament in 2002 amid a dispute with the former government over its handling of a Maoist insurgency.
No date has been set for new elections or when parliament will resume.
New laws will also be passed to require the establishment of health clinics for women across the country, especially in rural areas where residents have little access to medical care.

 Text of report by Nepalese Kantipuronline.com website on 12 August
 Kathmandu, 12 August: The Royal Nepal Army [RNA] has said that 75 security personnel are still missing after clashes with Maoists in Kalikot [mid-western region] on Sunday night [7 August]. Speaking at a press meet here in the capital Friday, RNA Spokesman Deepak Gurung said: ""Forty-three security personnel and a civilian contractor died during the overnight battle at the Pili security base camp.""
 The death toll in one of the deadliest attacks has now reached 70. Maoists had admitted that they lost 26 cadres in the gun-battle.
Kantipuronline.com website, Kathmandu, in English 12 Aug 05
Gurung said that 108 security men have come into contact and that the search for missing troops was on.
 Based on the accounts of locals, Gurung said that some 300 Maoists were killed in the clash. He, however, said that the army could not verify the fatalities on the Maoists side. ""We have recovered only six bodies of the Maoists so far,"" he added.
 The army spokesman said it was the first attack ever on the workforce (non-combatant forces) group. ""We never expected our workforce who were deployed for the purpose of road construction to come under attack,"" he said.
 ""The Maoists wanted to bring all development works in Karnali to an end,"" Gurung said, ""but the attack will not change our plans."" Stating that the army will continue with the development works in the Karnali region, he said the road construction works will resume within the next few days.
 The army spokesman also reiterated that the Maoists had blatantly violated the international humanitarian laws and the Geneva Convention by brutally killing the soldiers after taking them under control, a claim that has been refuted by the Maoists.
 ""Some of our soldiers were burnt alive, some were mutilated and some were shot in the head after being captured,"" he said.
 A video clip of an injured soldier currently undergoing treatment at the military hospital in Chhauni was shown to the journalists present in the press meet.
 ""The Maoists asked some 12 soldiers to surrender, tied their hands with ropes and then shot each of them in the head,"" the soldier, said.
 Gurung also informed that the RONAST [Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology] is conducting forensic tests of the slain soldiers and that the reports would be handed over to the National Human Rights Commission.
 Over 230 security personnel including 100 non-combatant soldiers were deployed at the camp for carrying out development works.
 The temporary base camp was established to construct the Surkhet-Jumla road section in the Karnali zone, the most underdeveloped zone in the country.
 At the press meet, it was informed that 4,513 Maoists and 557 army men have been killed since the breakdown of the second round of cease-fire in August 2002

Text of report by Bikas Lamsal, published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 16 December
Gadgade, Nagarkot [Bhaktapur]: The faces of all were melancholic. After an armed member of a ""disciplined institution"", the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), went berserk and killed 12 innocent villagers, the Gadgade village of Nagarkot wore a deserted look Thursday [15 December], nursing a wound that will cause pain forever.
Following the killing of 12 villagers for no fault of theirs, no one was in a condition to speak coherently. With voices hoarse with grief and tearful eyes boiling with rage, they were cursing the RNA soldier Basudev Thapa. The revelry that took place every year at the jatra [religious procession] of Mangsir Purnima was turned into a bloody tragedy by a deranged man.
Ram Lal Nagarkote, who was attending the jatra along with his wife, two daughters and a son to light a sacred lamp, had his forehead pierced by the soldier's bullet as he poured oil into the lamp, before he could pray to Lord Shiva. ""Father was putting oil in the lamp; suddenly a bullet hit his forehead,"" said Nagarkote's eldest son, Pratap. ""I could not do anything. Bullets were being fired rat-a-tat. I left my father and ran and survived.""
He said that as he ran his elder sister, Nanu, fell after being hit by a bullet.
After an argument between local youths and Thapa, a soldier at the military school, not only the siblings of the Nagarkote family but the families of Bhagwan Tamang, Aite Tamang, Sujan Shrestha and Ram Prasad Pant, too, have been rendered bereft of a guardian.
""My parents left me when I was a kid. Now my husband has died. How will I provide for my six kids,"" lamented Krishna Kumari, Ram Lal's first wife. ""I'm so unlucky. I have to always suffer such a fate.""
Kale Tamang had gone to the temple leaving behind his seven-months' pregnant wife, four-year-old daughter and old mother - never to return. His family has been grief-stricken since midnight Wednesday.
After the incident, his pregnant wife fainted while she cried and his old mother was just staring, speechless. As the entire village is steeped in grief, many aggrieved families lack hands to help bring the bodies back.  Her eldest son Dipak having been killed in the incident, Maili Tamang, a local, is in such a predicament.
Spent bullet casings were strewn all over the site of the incident. The trees around the temple were pockmarked by bullets.

"6094",20073431,"Title: Former communist rebels join interim government in Nepal , pledge to hold elections.rtf; Date: April 2, 2007 Monday 12:35 AM GMT; Text: Six former communist rebels have been sworn in as part of Nepal's interim government, a major step in a peace process that ended their decade-long insurgency.
The Maoist leaders pledged during the ceremony Sunday to ensure development in the impoverished Himalayan nation and hold credible elections in June.
""This day marks the beginning of a new Nepal,"" said the top rebel leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who goes by the name Prachanda. ""Our next goal is to provide some immediate relief to the people and then turn toward long-term development of the country.""
Prachanda said the rebels' main focus would be the upcoming elections for a special assembly that will rewrite the constitution and decide whether Nepal will continue as a constitutional monarchy. The Maoists had fought for 10 years to replace Nepal's monarchy with a republic.
More than 13,000 people were killed before a cease-fire was declared in April 2006, following weeks of pro-democracy protests that forced King Gyanendra to give up sole political power and restore the disbanded parliament.
On Sunday, the six former insurgents took an oath of office in a ceremony broadcast on national television, along with 16 other ministers and junior ministers. Five former rebels were appointed ministers, while a sixth was given a junior minister position in the new government to be headed by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. Prachanda was not among those appointed.
The former insurgents have been given a number of powerful positions, including rebel spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who became minister for information and communication; and longtime militant Dev Gurung, who is the new minister for local development.
""This is the beginning of a new chapter in Nepal's history. I urge all to leave behind all minor differences and move forward together to get to our goals,"" said Koirala, who was re-elected prime minister for the sixth time earlier Sunday.
""The government will be fully devoted to establishing peace and security in the country.""
The interim government was welcomed by the international community, which has pressed Nepal's politicians to hold elections on time and restore peace and security.
""As a partner in the Interim Government, the Maoists must now be held fully accountable for their actions. They must meet their commitments and at last join the mainstream as a nonviolent political party,"" said a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Nepal.
The European Union, in a statement, called on the government to ""to move the peace process further forward by preparing vigorously for timely elections.""
The inclusion of the former rebels is part of a peace process that began when the Maoists signed an accord in November. The Maoists have since locked up their weapons, confined their fighters to U.N.-monitored camps and joined the parliament.

 Kathmandu, 30 June: Dayaram Yadhav and Rajaram Yadhav of Bagara-6, Madhpura, Mahottari district central Nepal were deliberately killed by the security forces even though the intelligence they received was incorrect, say local residents.

They have also insisted that the guilty be punished and that the families of the victims are compensated without delay.
 They also said at the press conference that an investigation committee had been set up headed by the of the district, the deputy chief district officer but, because the head of the committee was enmeshed in a controversy, the hearing had not taken place.

Reluctance by international institutions to lend money to developing countries would make it difficult for some of them to manage their balance of payments positions, said Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
By lowering the growth rates of developed countries, the financial crisis may also lower exports of developing countries, said Singh.
""The G-20 must do everything in its power so that the process of development is not adversely affected by the global crisis.""
Leaders of India, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Bangladesh also agreed to work for an early conclusion of negotiations for a free trade agreement for the group, known as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, or BIMSTEC.
The agreement on trade in goods, services and investment for the BIMSTEC region is aimed at boosting economic growth and strengthening the global bargaining power of the Southern Asian region home to more than 1.3 billion people, or nearly one-fifth of the world's population.
Latha Reddy, a BIMSTEC representative, said the free trade agreement was likely to be completed in a couple of months.
The seven nations also decided to expand rail, road, air and shipping links, Singh said. In addition, members decided to coordinate efforts in fighting terrorism.
""Terrorists are using the Bay of Bengal sea lanes to transport arms and ammunition,"" said Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The BIMSTEC summit came ahead of Friday's meeting convened by U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington of representatives of some of the world's biggest industrial democracies, emerging nations and international bodies to review causes and solutions for the financial mess.
Besides the United States, countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey and the European Union make up the so-called G-20.
BIMSTEC was launched in 1997 to increase economic cooperation among the member countries.

"4147",2005564,"Title: The year that was.rtf; Date: December 9, 2005 Friday 11:35 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Dec 9 -- It was the coldest winter I can recall: late winter monsoon added dampness to the chill to usher in morning mists. I was down with joint pains and stayed in bed much of the days and nights. Quite a few celebrities felt they had had enough. Among those that departed were J.N. Dixit (former foreign secretary), Bollywood villain Amrish Puri, S.S. Grewal (former cabinet secretary) and film star Parveen Babi, who was found dead in her flat after three days.
  Spilled over from the year past were continuing confrontations in Jammu and Kashmir between jehadi militants and our security forces, amid continuing official assertions that infiltration of hostile elements was on the decline. Also a continuance from the past year were the turns and twists of the trial for murder of the seer of Kanchipuram. A stampede in a temple in Gujarat left 350 dead.
  What was new was Justice Banerjee's finding that the fire in the train at Godhra railway station was not caused by a Muslim mob from the outside but by mischievous elements from within the compartment. It gave the lie to Chief Minister Narendra Modi's assertion that the pogrom of innocent Muslims that followed was a revenge for the attack on the train. What brought cheer to Sikhs was the appointment of General J.J. Singh as Chief of Army Staff, the numero uno. The general, not known for modesty, was the loudest in self-praise.
  By February, winter loosened its grip and the season of flowers was in full swing. I suffered a grievous loss in the death of my closest friend for over 70 years, Prem Kirpal - professor, secretary of the Education Ministry, head of the cultural department of Unesco and much else. Turmoil in neighbouring Nepal gave the king an excuse to dismiss the elected government and assume dictatorial powers along with gagging the press. Goa opted for a change of chief minister. Three states, Haryana, Jharkhand and Bihar, went to the polls. The Congress won a clear majority in Haryana. Bihar and Jharkhand failed to give any party a clear majority and ushered in a period of horse-trading.
  The season of flowers continued in March. Among those who departed were actor Gemini Ganesan, cartoonist O.V. Vijayan, my young friend Surinder Singh, MP (s/o Bansi Lal) and industrialist O.P. Jindal in a helicopter crash. The last to go was Bhapa Pritam Singh, founder of the leading Punjabi publishing house Navyug. Almost all the top Punjabi novelists and poets were published by him.
  Cheering news was India trouncing China in the Davis Cup and the US snubbing Narendra Modi by denying him a visa. Not so cheerful was the acquittal of men charged with conspiracy to blow up Air-India Kanishka which killed well over 300 innocent men and women. This was evidently a miscarriage of justice and a re-hearing of the case began.
  A short spring gave way to summer. The month started off with the death of Pope John Paul (84), pontiff for 26 years. A German cardinal was elected the 265th Pope of the Catholic world under the papal title Benedict. At home Indo-Pak cricket matches held centrestage. India won the first two matches (Tendulkar took five wickets in Cochin), and at Visakhapatnam, Dhoni scored 148. Pakistan won the series. Despite unabated terrorist violence in Kashmir, Indo-Pak moves towards peace continued. The road between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was opened. The Sabarmati Express met with an accident, killing over 20 and injuring over 150. When Railway Minister Lalu Yadav went to condole with the victims and relations of the dead, Modi's hoodlums stoned him.
  There was a change in the leadership of the CPI(M). Harkishen Singh Surjeet was succeeded by Prakash Karat; his wife Brinda was elected member of the politburo. The Chinese and the Japanese premiers were in Delhi: one to discuss the boundary dispute, the other to enhance trade relations. May saw the departure of Gen. J.S. Arora, liberator of Bangladesh, actor-minister Sunil Dutt and film-maker Ismail Merchant.
  I had grossly misjudged the weather. I fled Delhi in the last week of April to the balmy cool atmosphere of Kasauli. It was chilly and rained almost every day forcing me to stay indoors by the heater. Early June, I came to Delhi hoping to welcome the monsoon. There was not a sign of it. Meanwhile, two friends I admired, respected, cherished took their leave. One was R.S. Narula, retired Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court and as true a gursikh as I have known. The other was H.D. Shourie of Common Cause, who went in his sleep at the age of 93. He was an upright and bold man who single-handedly brought relief to millions who had been denied justice.
  Two others who went were the cricketer Mushtaq of Indore and Sunder Singh of the BJP. India's decline in hockey continued. We lost to Pakistan, Korea and Malaysia. As if to make up for the debacle four Indian girls hoisted the tri-colour atop the Everest. Hizb militants continued to kill innocent Kashmiris - 14 one"
"1816",20044753,"Title: South Asia has low AIDS rates but conditions 'ripe' outside India.rtf; Date: July 6, 2004 Tuesday; Text: South Asia has a low overall prevalence of AIDS but lack of sexual awareness coupled with intravenous drug use made conditions outside India ripe for the spread of the virus, a UN official said Tuesday.
India has 5.1 million people living with HIV, the largest number in the world apart from South Africa, but it represents only a small proportion of its one billion-plus population.
""What we see in South Asia is that the overall prevalence rate is low which is encouraging, but we see concentration of the epidemic in marginalised populations -- like intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men -- which should alarm us,"" warned Purnima Mane, director of the Social Mobilisation and the Information Department of UNAIDS in Geneva.
The spread of HIV/AIDS through intravenous drug use was affecting Nepal, Pakistan and several states of India's northeast, she said.
""Injecting drug use needs to be looked at very carefully,"" she told a press conference in New Delhi where a new UNAIDS report was released.
Though most infections were through unprotected sex, injecting drug use in India's north-east bordering Myanmar and close to the notorious Golden Triangle drug-producing area saw HIV infection rates of up to 75 percent, the UN report said.
Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, project director of the National AIDS Control Organisation, said Tuesday India had successfully brought down new HIV infections with a multi-faceted strategy.
""India recorded 520,000 new HIV cases in 2003, down from 610,000 in 2002, she said adding, ""The drop in new infections in 2003 is proof that India's anti-AIDS campaign is working.""
India launched its biggest anti-AIDS operation after announcing last year's figures, with the then-Hindu nationalist-led government speaking openly for the first time of the need to use condoms.
A study three years ago found that a quarter of the Indian population had never even heard of AIDS, the UNAIDS report said.
Elsewhere in south Asia ""behavioural information suggests that conditions are ripe for HIV to spread,"" according to the report.
In Bangladesh, despite currently low HIV rates, a rise in drug use in some areas, a highly active commercial sex trade and the widespread shunning of birth control threatens a spike in infections.
Surveys there showed fewer than 20 percent of married women and 33 percent of married men had heard of AIDS.
""In Bangladesh, the interesting thing is that the country has taken the epidemic seriously. It has a very small epidemic which has continued to remain small,"" Mane said.
""But they have recognised that they have a situation which is hidden -- of men who have sex with men. And because it is hidden, it is almost inaccessible for prevention programmes. They have recognised that this is a serious issue for a country that has such high levels of poverty,"" she said.
The UN report noted the first outbreak of HIV infection among intravenous drug users in Pakistan was reported in 2003. Few had heard about AIDS and even fewer had ever used a condom.
Pakistan at present has a estimated adult prevalence of 0.1 percent, it said.
The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka has been quite low, Mane said. ""The problem is with sex workers, especially young boys and paedophilia,"" she added.
However, the UN official was critical of ""the policies in many of these countries which are not as open as they should be for many of the marginalised populations"" of HIV infected.
""What one has to remember is to be careful not to be complacent and say the epidemic is small and so no need to worry,"" she said.
""The time to worry is when it small because that is when you can make a difference by keeping it small.""

"5907",20072245,"Title: British museum refuses to return Nepal soldier's Victoria Cross - paper.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: July 19, 2007 Thursday
Excerpt from unattributed report titled ""Upon seeing his Victoria Cross in a British museum..."" published by Nepalese newspaper Gorkhapatra on 19 July
Kathmandu, 18 July: Upon seeing his Victoria Cross, taken away deceptively from him 30 years ago, at the Winchester Museum in UK, 84-year-old Tul Bahadur Pun requested its return. The museum authorities however turned down Pun's request.
Tul Bahadur Pun, who put his life in danger fighting for England in the Second World War, was awarded the Victoria Cross.
Pun, who had gone to Britain to accept an honour that the UK wanted to confer on him, visited Winchester Museum last Friday [13 July].
Pun, who suffers from cataract, had to be satisfied with looking at the medal through a glass window. The veteran soldier, who went through much anguish searching for his medal, had heard that it was kept in a museum but had not seen it. On seeing his medal he swelled with pride and said: ""I am happy to see the medal after such a long time, but my eyes cannot see it properly, I cannot make out clearly what is inside the glass.""
He asked the museum authorities to have his medal back, but his request was turned down. ""This is my medal, I want to take it back, I have to take it back"", Pun insisted to the museum authorities. Ironically, the museum features a picture of Victoria Cross winner Pun in the publicity material it uses to attract visitors,
""After his request was turned down Pun lost hope and gazed at the medal for a long time without batting an eyelid"", Gorkha Army Ex- Servicemen's Organization (Gaeso) Chairman Padam Bahadur Gurung, who accompanied Pun to the museum, told the Gorkhapatra.
Pun fought in Burma for the British in 1944 during the Second World War. He was awarded the Victoria Cross by the British government for his courage during the war. The Victoria Cross is Britain's highest military honour.
Thirty years after receiving the Victoria Cross, Pun received a letter from the Sixth Gurkha Rifles, in which he had served. At the time he did not think it urgent to read the letter. Some time later a British Army officer came to his house at Begkhola in Myagdi district [in western Nepal] and informed him that his medal was an invaluable possession. The officer said that he was taking the medal for safe keeping with the army. ""When he said that the invaluable possession would be kept safely, I gave it to him"", Pun says.
Some days later Pun was paid 40,000 Indian rupees but was not told what the money was for. Pun, who was then living in difficult circumstances, thought it to be ""some kind of award for his role in the war"".
Winchester Museum Chairman Christopher Bullock informed that the medal was bought from Pun at the then going rate, Gaeso chairman Gurung said. ""The medal has been showcased here to inspire the world to take up military service"", Gurung quoted Bullock as saying.
After Michael Howe, a British lawyer who has been representing Pun, assured him ""that the medal belongs to Pun, he won it at risk to his life and he should get it back no matter how"", Pun has been considering the option of approaching the court for retrieving his medal.

"7739",20115960,"Title: 102 pilgrims killed in stampede at Indian festival.rtf; Date: January 15, 2011 Saturday; Text: KOCHI, Jan. 15 -- - A stampede of pilgrims returning from one of India's most popular Hindu festivals killed at least 102 people and injured 44 others, officials said Saturday.
The stampede was set off Friday night when a group of pilgrims in a jeep drove into a crowd of worshippers walking along a narrow forest path as they returned from offering prayers at the hilltop Sabarimala shrine in the state of Kerala in southern India, said local police official Sanjay Kumar.
All the injured were hospitalized, some in serious condition, Kumar told The Associated Press.
""We have recovered 102 bodies. The rescue work is almost over,"" he said.
The area was flooded with pilgrims and the stampede occurred nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of the temple site, Kumar said.
The annual two-month festival attracts millions of worshippers to the remote temple to the Hindu deity Ayyappan. The ceremony Friday marked the end of the festival, and an estimated 150,000 devotees were thought to have taken the narrow path out of the densely forested hills where the stampede took place, said Thomas Isaac, the state finance minister.
Millions of devotees make the pilgrimage each year, and nearly 2,000 police officers were deployed near the shrine to prevent such an accident from happening.
Isaac said police had scoured the forest area near the stampede site and did not expect to find any more bodies.
""So far 56 bodies have been identified. Our priority now is to identify the rest of the bodies and hand them over to the families of the victims,"" he said.
Rescue workers found it difficult to reach the stampede site due to the dense tropical forest on the hills surrounding the vast Sabarimala temple complex, Isaac said.
Manoj Kutty, 33, was returning from Sabarimala after participating in a ritual lamp lighting ceremony and evening prayers at the temple complex when the stampede occurred.
""People were rushing downhill, and we could see people fall down and others fall over them. It all happened in seconds,"" Kutty said Saturday.
A small stampede at Sabarimala last week killed one pilgrim, Press Trust of India reported.
Deadly stampedes are relatively common at temples in India, where large crowds - sometimes hundreds of thousands of people - gather in tiny areas with no safety measures or crowd control.
In March, 63 people were killed when poor villagers scrambled for free food and clothing being given away at a ceremony at a temple in northern Uttar Pradesh state. In 2008, more than 145 people died in a stampede at a remote Hindu temple at the foothills of the Himalayas. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

There was no immediate comment from the home ministry, but a family member of former government spokesman Shrish Shumshere Rana said he was being held on charges of plotting against the new administration.
""He has been accused of conspiring against the current government,"" said the relative on condition of anonymity.
The relative added that Rana was arrested by plainclothes police on Friday afternoon.
Former Home Minister Kamal Thapa and ex-Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey were arrested at around the same time, according to police and family members.
""My father has been served a 90-day arrest warrant and has been taken to police barracks,"" said Pandey's son Nischal Nath Pandey.
Local media said the three were arrested on the orders of the home ministry.
Former local development minister Tanka Dhakal was the fourth man detained Friday, state-run media reported.
""The former local development minister was arrested,"" Radio Nepal reported.
The new government took power last month after weeks of pro-democracy protests forced King Gyanendra to give up absolute rule and restore parliament.
A commission formed to probe government rights abuses during the 14 months of King Gyanendra's rule recommended to the home ministry Thursday that former senior officials be closely monitored while their investigation was taking place, a commission member told AFP.
The commission has recommended that the government suspend the heads of the army, police, armed police and the national investigation department.
""The security chiefs could hamper investigations into abuses,"" Radio Nepal reported.
The interim government established after the royal climbdown has agreed to begin peace talks with rebel Maoists, and to form a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution, clipping the powers of the king.

Government officials met with representatives of two private school organizations, but the talks did not yield any agreement and another session was due Tuesday.
""We have asked the private schools to reconsider their decision to close indefinitely because this has affected a great number of students,"" said education ministry spokesman Laba Prasad Tripathi.
Private school bodies announced Sunday they would shut down indefinitely around Nepal after leftist students padlocked the offices of principals and accountants at 160 institutions.
The decision has affected 1.5 million students and around 125,000 staff members, said Umesh Shrestha, head of the Private Boardings and Schools Organization (eds: group name correct).
A coalition of seven student unions said Saturday that activists would forcibly shut down the head offices of all schools charging tuition of more than 500 rupees (6.65 dollars) a month.
The protesters contend that tuition fees have rarely gone to help students' welfare or improve the quality of instruction.
Nepal has seen frequent protests at its schools and universities.
In December, more than 4,000 schools around the capital Kathmandu were shuttered for two weeks over demands for lower tuition by a student group affiliated with Maoist rebels.

""At least 40 rebels were killed Saturday morning when they clashed with  security forces in the Sundariphanta area in Kanchanpur district but so far, only the bodies of six Maoists have been recovered,"" an army statement said.
""The Maoists fled the area carrying many of their injured or dead colleagues,"" the statement added.
Violence has been rising in recent months since a pledge by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to hold long-delayed elections if the Maoists failed to agree to resume peace talks by January 13.
The deadline passed with the Maoists rejecting the call for negotiations and vowing to wreck the polls.
The rebels are holding out for talks with King Gyanendra under international mediation focusing on their demand for elections for an assembly that would draft a fresh constitution aimed at establishing a communist republic.
Authorities have rejected their demands.
Deuba was appointed last year by the monarch with orders to call elections and hold talks with the rebels.
Gyanendra has been under mounting domestic and international pressure to restore democracy after dismissing parliament in 2002 amid political turmoil and spiralling rebel violence.
More than 11,000 people have died since 1996 when the Maoists launched an insurgency to topple the monarchy and install a communist republic.

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala made the announcement after meeting with leaders of the seven ruling parties and former Maoist rebels who are set to join the government soon.
He said the constitution would be immediately amended to accommodate the changes.
""I am urging all the protesting groups to take back their agitation and to find solution to all the problems through peaceful means,"" Koirala said.
The number of people killed since violence erupted mid-January in southern and southeastern Nepal has reached 21.
Several groups began organizing protests Jan. 19 to demand more autonomy and greater representation for their region in the legislature and administration. They say the south has been sidelined in favor of the more populated mountainous areas in the north.
There was no immediate reaction from the protesting groups on Koirala's pledge. Leaders of these groups could not be reached immediately for comments.
Earlier Wednesday, police opened fire on hundreds of protesters in a southeastern Nepal city, killing at least two and wounding several more in fresh violence.
Police first fired warning shots and then fired at the protesters as they marched toward a police post on the outskirts of Biratnagar, the second largest city in Nepal, about 250 miles southeast of Katmandu, police official Gopal Bhandari said by phone.
""There were about 10,000 people armed with spears and other weapons marching toward the policemen. First shots were fired in the air and when they did not stop, the policemen were compelled to fire on the crowd,"" Bhandari said. Twenty-two police and 16 protesters were injured.

Royal Nepalese Army spokesman Col. Deepak Gurung said the army was providing security to hundreds of buses and trucks each day and even using army planes to fly stranded passengers.
The attempt by the rebels to shut down trade and transportation has paralyzed business and forced vehicles off roads in at least 30 of Nepal's 75 districts since March 7.
Businesses are losing about 1 billion rupees (US$13.3 million) a day because of the blockade, which was announced by the rebels when they celebrated the eighth anniversary of their armed rebellion last month.
Since the blockade began, groups of rebels have been stopping vehicles on the roads and ordering them to return. They have burned at least half a dozen buses and trucks for failing to comply.
""There has been a significant increase in traffic since we began to provide security to these vehicles,"" Gurung said. Traffic on highways is beginning to return to normal, he said.
Industries in many parts of Nepal have been forced to close because of a shortage of raw materials, and agricultural products have been rotting because farmers have been unable to transport their goods.
The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives.

Amik Sherchan and Lilamani Pokhrel of the People's Front Nepal party were freed Wednesday evening after the court ruled they were being held illegally.
Their party is one of seven political parties which have formed an alliance to protest the king's seizure of direct power in February.
Party official Pari Thapa said the two politicians were in hiding and feared they would be re-arrested if they were found by police.
Unmarked police vans followed the men's vehicles after their release, but they were able to elude the police. Family members said they had not heard from the two men.
""It is illegal for the government to disobey the orders of the Supreme Court. It shows that the government does not abide by the law,"" Thapa said.
Government officials refused to comment.
Sherchan and Pokhrel were arrested along with hundreds of other politicians immediately after King Gyanendra seized absolute power in February.
Most have been freed in the past few weeks after the lifting of a state of emergency, but some remain in jail.
Another senior leader of the same party, Navraj Subedi, was re-arrested by police at the party's office in Katmandu on Wednesday, just hours after he was freed by the court. The government did not give any reason or specify any law in re-arresting him.
Its action was condemned by legal groups.
""The government is going against the Supreme Court despite repeated warnings. This is a direct insult to the highest legal body,"" said Indra Lohani, secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association.
Last month, the Supreme Court summoned Home Minister Dan Bahadur Shahi and ordered him to obey the court. The government had earlier re-arrested several politicians after the court ordered their release.
The king seized control of the Himalayan nation on Feb. 1, fired the government and imposed a state of emergency, saying the restrictive measures were needed to quell an anti-monarchist communist insurgency. He suspended civil liberties, including freedom of the press, and jailed hundreds of political prisoners.

 Narayangad, central Nepal , 13 March: A British couple who survived a tourist bus attack arrived Kathmandu on Friday 12 March . The couple survived the stoning by Maoists by hiding under the seat.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 14 Mar 04
""They lobbed many big stones at the bus. We were afraid. We survived by hiding under the seat,"" 58-year-old Briton Jennifer Janian name transliterated and his wife Stadder said recalling the incident three days earlier.
 They reached Chitwan Thursday 11 March for a jungle safari after spending five days in Pokhara in western Nepal . Maoists stoned the bus as they were going to Tiger Tops Hotel in the Royal Chitwan National Park.
 The Maoists came on three bicycles, smashed all glass of the passenger bus and attempted to set it alight.
 Showing the cuts on her legs caused by smashed glass Jennifer said, ""They forced us out of the bus after shattering all glasses and doused the seats with kerosene."" The driver sped away before Maoists could torch the bus and the rebels fled to the nearby jungle.
 The locals found a rickshaw and sent them to Bharatpur from Mangalpur.
 The couple had come to Nepal for the first time. ""This was our first visit. Such incidents will not help Nepal and Nepalese,"" they said.  Passage omitted: They are leaving Nepal after five days without cutting short their visit.

High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour on Wednesday warned leaders of Nepal's Maoist insurgency that they cannot escape punishment for human rights abuses.
 'In every part of the world, political and military leaders who thought themselves immune from persecution are now answering before the law for the gross human rights abuses they have perpetrated,' Arbour said.
She was addressing a press conference at the end of her four-day visit to Nepal, which she said was motivated by a growing concern over reports of a grave human rights crisis afflicting the Himalayan kingdom.
 Nepalese people are subjected to violence and brutality which the warring Maoist rebels have chosen as the means to advance their cause, she said, adding many of those means are contrary to fundamental human rights and international laws.
 Agents of the state too have abused fundamental rights of the people and a climate of impunity prevails, said Arbour, who is the most senior U.N. official to visit Nepal in recent times.
 'I warn the leaders of the insurgency not to misread developments in the wider world nor to believe that they can operate outside of the law,' she said.
 'It is increasingly clear that we have entered an era of accountability,' she added. 'In every part of the world, political and military leaders who thought themselves immune from prosecution are now answering before the law for the gross human rights abuses they have perpetrated.'

New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said the passing of Hillary was a profound loss. ""Sir Ed described himself as an average New Zealander with modest abilities. In reality, he was a colossus,"" Clark said in a statement.
""He was an heroic figure who not only 'knocked off' Everest but lived a life of determination, humility, and generosity,"" she said. ""But most of all he was a quintessential Kiwi. He was ours -- from his craggy appearance and laconic style to his directness and honesty.""
Hillary, who was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II shortly after his historic feat on May 29, 1953, died of a heart attack in Auckland Hospital.
""He was a truly great hero who captured the imagination of the world, a towering figure who will always be remembered as a pioneer explorer and leader,"" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, former New Zealand deputy prime minister Don McKinnon, called Hillary a ""leader of men"" and fully-deserving of the state funeral now being prepared.
""We just saw him as that iconic New Zealander, slightly self-effacing, didn't take life or himself particularly very seriously,"" he told BBC radio.
Nepal's Sherpas went into mourning and pledged to ensure his legacy lives on in the community he has helped with his Himalayan Trust since his Everest ascent.
They plan a memorial and are considering putting a statue in the mountaineering park, said Zimba Zangbu Sherpa, vice president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
""We consider him as a second father,"" said Zimba Zangbu Sherpa, who attended one of the first schools set up by Hillary in the Solokhumbu region in Everest's foothills.
""His work changed the life of the whole Sherpa community. Without his work, especially the schools, the Sherpas would be nowhere. I am sure it (his work) will continue.""
The New Zealander conquered the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) mountain with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. He returned the following year to launch community projects in the impoverished region around the base of the world's tallest mountain.
Hillary's trust, set up in the 1960s, built schools and hospitals, and trained health workers in the harsh, mountainous region. He also helped build an airstrip to promote tourism.
""We have lost a dear friend of Nepal and a worldwide hero,"" Prithvi Subba Gurung, Nepal's Minister of Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation, told AFP.
There was also a tribute from the oldest man to conquer the world's tallest peak.
""Unlike myself among many others, who climb an already beaten path, he climbed with no clue what was ahead of him,"" said Katsusuke Yanagisawa, who last year became the world's oldest person to climb Everest at 71 years old.
Australian mountaineer Lincoln Hall, who survived after being left for dead on Everest two years ago, told national radio: ""Edmund Hillary is immortal, really.
""The legacy left behind is not just achieving one of those great feats of exploration and human endeavour, but the contribution he's made to altruistic work in developing countries sets an example that no one, I think, can better anywhere.""
New Zealand's cricket team will wear black arm bands and observe a minute's silence in Hillary's honour along with the crowd before play starts in the second test against Bangladesh in Wellington on Saturday.

""The Maoists will be included in the government when the process of arms management is completed,"" Koirala told Friday's state-owned Rising Nepal newspaper.
""The government will be constituted within 15-20 days, after the separation of arms from the Maoist militia.""
Under a historic peace pact in November, the Maoists agreed to end their ""people's war"" in which at least 12,500 people were killed, and join mainstream politics.
The Maoists began handing over weapons Wednesday at two sites, a process that is due to spread to 28 camps.
Weapons were being stored in UN containers, but media have not been allowed to witness the handover which has no formal completion date.
The Maoists dissolved on Thursday their ""people's government"", which had controlled large swathes of the Himalayan nation, as part of the peace deal to end a bloody decade-long insurgency.
That followed the entry by the ultra-leftists into a new parliament alongside the seven main political parties on Monday after a new temporary constitution was approved.
The rebels claim to have 35,000 soldiers in their army, but independent estimates put their numbers at closer to 12,000.
Apart from those needed to protect Maoist camps and leaders, the rebels are to place all weapons in the UN containers.
Under the peace deal reached late last year, the Nepal Army is due to be confined to barracks and place the same number of weapons as the Maoists under UN supervision.

The Maoists have ordered traffic not to enter Kathmandu, sending prices of food essentials soaring in the city of 1.5 million people even though hundreds of trucks continue to enter and leave daily with military protection.
The government has been in contact with pro-Maoist students in a bid to end the blockade, a cabinet official said. The students have been demanding the release of allegedly missing colleagues and threatening to add to the chaos by calling a strike at Kathmandu's universities.
""We have told the students that we will come to the negotiating table with you provided you insist that your sister organisations withdraw the blockade,"" the official said.
He said Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was meeting Tuesday with his cabinet to decide whether to concede a major demand for ending the blockade: that the government stop calling the rebels terrorists.
The classification has kept underground the leadership of the guerrillas, who want to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist state.
Repeated government appeals to the Maoists to end the blockade, the last one made Monday by Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari, have fallen on deaf ears.
Padma Ratna Tuladhar, who was a go-between for the Maoists and government in failed peace talks last year, called the government's appeals over the past week a ""gimmick.""
""The government has not even met a contact person from the Maoist side,"" Tuladhar said, adding that the rebels were unlikely to respond to statements broadcast over state-run radio.
Opposition politicians and industrialists have been demanding the government go further to end the mayhem by declaring a unilateral ceasefire with the Maoists to halt the war that has claimed some 10,000 lives.
But the government has refused and previously said it would only consider Maoist demands during peace talks.
The United States said Monday that foreign support was key to defeating the rebels, who are strongly anti-American.
US State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said: ""Clearly we see them as insurgents that need to be defeated.
""We think it's important that other countries work with Nepal towards this end.""

""Naxalite (Maoist rebel) activity has caused some problems in Andhra Pradesh but it's manageable and one need not be unnecessarily panicky about it,"" Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters on the fringes of a conference in New Delhi.
Andhra Pradesh's capital, Hyderabad, is second only to the southern city of Bangalore as a centre for India's rapidly expanding information technology and outsourcing industries.
When asked whether the rebel violence might deter foreigners from investing in Andhra Pradesh, Mukherjee said: ""It is for the investors to decide ... I'm saying there's no need for panicking."" 
Mukherjee's comments came after US Ambassador David C. Mulford on a visit to Hyderabad told reporters earlier this week he had asked the local administration about political violence.
""I asked about the political violence ... (which is a) concern for foreign investors ... the Naxalite activity which is a concern for people outside,"" Mulford said.
The United States is one of the top 10 foreign direct investors in India.
The Maoists have sometimes targeted foreign-owned companies and factories during the three-decade-old conflict in Andhra Pradesh that has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Last week, the rebels pulled out of a fledgling peace process with the state government, accusing it of ""unprovoked killings"" of their comrades. The police, for their part, accused the rebels of using the peace process to re-arm.
India's ultra leftists have ties with Maoists battling to overthrow the monarchy in neighbouring Nepal and some Indian commentators have expressed concern that the Maoist revolt in Nepal could spill over the border.

The Maoists stormed out of government this week demanding the monarchy be immediately abolished and have embarked on a campaign of strikes and street protests aimed at ousting King Gyanendra and closing the palace.
The move is a major blow to a peace deal signed late last year, under which the ultra-leftists agreed for the issue to be decided after democratic elections set for November. The Maoists have now vowed to disrupt the polls.
""Prime Minister (Girija Prasad) Koirala had three responsibilities. To keep the alliance of eight parties intact, to run the government and to conduct free and fair elections,"" Maoist central committee member C.P. Gajurel told AFP.
""He has failed in all three and morally he should resign,"" he said, adding that the ex-rebels' ""protest programmes will continue.""
Koirala, an elderly and respected figure, is widely viewed as the architect of the November 2006 peace accord that ended a decade of civil war.
The Maoists insist King Gyanendra needs to be dethroned before the polls, arguing the embattled monarch and his supporters may find a way of clinging to their positions.
The ex-rebels have said they have no intention of returning to war and that their People's Liberation Army will remain in camps monitored by the United Nations.

""Our revolution is not over yet.
We have completed only half our task,"" Baburam Bhattarai, the rebels' second-in-command, told a cheering crowd at the Tudikhel Open-Air Theater in heart of the Nepalese capital.
The theater, festooned with red flags, was packed to capacity. Rebel recruits, many wearing red headbands, were directing the crowds.
Security was tight with police posted throughout the capital to prevent any violence. But the rally - which the government allowed - was peaceful.
Last weekend, Bhattarai emerged from hiding and made his first public appearance in years to take part in planned peace talks with the government.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
But it was still not clear when the peace talks would take place. Bhattarai has said the government must first free rebel supporters still in jail, as agreed by the two sides. The rebels also claim their supporters were being harassed.
""Despite the cease-fire, our supporters and sympathizers are still harassed by the army. They have not released our people and made public information on those missing while they were still in custody,"" said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a rebel leader.
The rebels are demanding an interim government and an election of a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.

Taking strong exception to the move of JD(U), RJD chief Lalu Prasad said Mr Kumar had done great damage to united fight for protecting the pride of the state and gave a clarion call for enmasse resignation of MPs, MLAs and MLCs of all political parties from Bihar to launch nation-wide campaign. Mr Kumar dubbed the resignation call of Mr Prasad as nothing but a clever move to create circumstances for imposition of the President Rule in Bihar. 
Despite extension of the deadline by Mr Prasad for seeking resignation of MPs, MLAs and MLCs, the cold response of the Chief Minister virtually put all these exercise in back burner. North Bihar which faced problem of floods by turbulent rivers almost every year, was hit by catastrophe flood from the Kosi river claiming more than 100 lives and damaging property worth of crores of rupees. The gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that the Chief Minister dubbed it as 'unprecedented catastrophy' in the state and made a call for assitance from all sectors besides seeking a comprehensive package from the Centre. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi made an aerial survey of the flood affected areas of north Bihar to make an on the spot assessment of the situation. Moved by enormity of the suffering of the people in devastating flood, Prime Minister declared it as 'national calamity' and announced a package of Rs 1000 crores to Bihar for carrying out massive relief operation. On one hand, people of north Bihar were reeling under the spate of floods while on the other hand, the political masters were engaged in trading charges on the lapses leading to breach of the Kosi embankment at Kushaha in Nepal on August 18. Bihar Chief Minister said the Kosi flood was a catastrophy and pointed out that devastating effect of natural calamity could only be minimised by carrying out relief and rescue operations. No fool proof arrangement could be made to prevent the breach of the embankment as it turned vulnerable with the increase in flow of water in the river following heavy rain.

"1255",20031195,"Title: 1996 catastrophe on Everest could happen again_ Jamling Tenzing.rtf; Date: May 27, 2003 Tuesday; Text: A devastating tragedy similar to what occurred on Mount Everest in May 1996 could happen again unless Nepal restricts access to the world's highest mountain, a leading climber has warned.
The warning came from Jamling Tenzing, 38, son of the late Sherpa Tenzing Norgay who conquered Mount Everest for the first time with Sir Edmund Hillary 50 years ago this month, who has himself climbed the peak but several dozen climbers, including many lacking experience, got lost in the storm leading to the 1996 disaster.
Nine of the climbers in the group died on the mountain, including two expedition leaders.
""I was very much part of the tragedy. I wouldn't like to see that happen again,"" Jamling, who is in Kathmandu as part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations marking the first ascent of the mountain, told AFP.
Asked if a similar tragedy could occur as a record number of expeditions assault the mountain to mark the legendary climb 50 years ago, he said: ""Yes, it can.""
Jamling is representing his father at the ongoing celebrations. He summited Everest in 1996 as part of an American expedition and participated in the rescue of the survivors stranded on the mountain.
As a youth he followed the advice of his father who told him that it was too dangerous to become an Everest sherpa guide, the local Nepalese climbers that do a lot of the back breaking work that goes into a climb.
""From the safety point of view, they should limit the expeditions to six at most, 23 is too many,"" he said, referring to the number of teams this year.
He also urged Nepalese tourist officials ""to make sure that some climbers at least have some experience in mountaineering.""
""Everest is still very difficult, we should never take the mountain for granted,"" he said, adding that paying 60,000 dollars to join a commercial expedition was not a sufficient enough criteria to climb the mountain.
As the son of one of the two heros of Everest, Jamling also criticized the commercialization that has come to epitomize climbing in the Himalayas.
""What has changed it most is attitude, today with the commercialisation, there are people who shouldn't be on the mountain,"" he said.
Evoking Hillary and his father, he recalled that ""their motivation was the passion to climb, the love for the mountain, that was what motivated them.""
At the same time Jamling, who heads an adventure tourism agency that operates in several Himalayan countries, did not think it was necessary to ban the access of people to the mountain.
""It has become very commercialized but you cannot stop people from climbing. The mountain is there for everyone to climb,"" he said.
In spring 1996, a total of 15 climbers died on the mountain, the record for fatalities in one season.
Among the victims were leaders of two commercial expeditions, New Zealander Rob Hall and American guide Scott Fischer.
The climbers were taken by the bad weather as they waited to make their way up or down the route that was first used by Hillary and Norgay.
Exhaustion, a lack of experience in some of the clients and a bottle neck in a key climbing passage caused by the large number of climbers produced the catastrophe.
Paradoxically, media attention from the disaster has led in subsequent years to another influx of climbers who have at times hoped to prove that they could survive where others had perished.
Jamling also said the environmental situation on the mountain, once called the ""world's highest garbage dump,"" has improved a lot in recent years. But he warned it vital clean-up efforts continued as trekking expeditions increased.
""It has become quite cleaner, we should continue to maintain that otherwise it would become dirty again,"" he said.

A rebel statement said individual Maoists attacked the tankers in a Nepalese border district out of anger at the arrest last week in India of senior guerrilla Mohan Baidya.
""A section of Maoist activists acted out of anger at his arrest,"" said the statement signed by Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara.
""But let us not sensationalise events. It is not our policy to cause harm to Indian interests or nationals.""
The Indian government had said it held the Maoist leadership responsible for the attack Saturday on the tankers, which were empty.
""This is a blatant act of terrorism and its perpetrators must be apprehended and punished for their crimes,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said Monday.
The Maoist rebels, who are fighting to overthrow Nepal's monarchy, oppose India's widespread political and economic influence in the landlocked Himalayan kingdom.
India, along with Britain and the United States, has provided financial support and military equipment to the government to tackle the insurgency, which has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.

Residents of Katmandu and its closest suburb, Lalitpur, will be prohibited indefinitely from leaving their homes between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. in an attempt to prevent violence, said Susil Ghimire, chief administrative officer of Katmandu district.
Violators will be jailed for one month and those who try to avoid arrest will be shot, he said.
The government also banned political protests in the capital, including a pro-democracy rally scheduled for Friday in Katmandu, saying that terrorist groups were planning to infiltrate the gathering, according to Ghimire. He had no other details.
The rally was being organized by political parties opposed to King Gyanendra, who took power after firing the previous government last year.
Earlier, the government urged residents of the Himalayan kingdom to stay calm after the Maoist rebels killed 12 policemen Saturday in bold attacks on police posts on the outskirts of Katmandu. It was the closest they have come to the capital since ending their unilateral cease-fire earlier this month.
The group said on its Web site Monday it was the beginning in a wave of violence.
The guerrillas, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to create a socialist state. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.

""It is part of our roadmap that the present Parliament, constitution and the government should be dissolved and replaced by an interim government and constitution,"" said Dinanath Sharma, part of a three-member rebel negotiating team which is in Katmandu for peace talks with the new government.
No date has been set for the talks.
Weeks of protests last month against King Gyanendra's direct rule forced him to reinstate Parliament and appoint a new prime minister.
Although the rebels supported the protests, organized by an alliance of seven major political parties, they have no representation in Parliament. The rebels have remained underground for the past decade fighting the government, and now control much of the countryside.
""This Parliament does not truly represent everyone and it is not in a position to resolve any problems and issues, that is why it should be immediately dissolved,"" Sharma said reporters.
Sharma said the rebels planned to join the interim government before elections are held for the constituent assembly that would rewrite the constitution.
""We will join the interim government ... not just us, but all those involved in the recent movement should be in the interim government, including civil society and rights activists,"" Sharma said.

Maoist spokesman Ramesh Koirala said in a statement that the 29 people captured would be ""gradually released after the necessary procedures.""

At least four soldiers, seven policemen and four rebels died when around 4,000 Maoists stormed security targets and government buildings in Palpa district, the defence ministry said after the battle.
The ministry said it believed casulaties among the rebels ""could have been very extensive"".
The Maoists said ""dozens of security personnel"" were killed, but gave no exact figure, and vowed to intensify its ""attack against the autocratic regime.""
The rebels have been fighting to establish a communist republic for the last 10 years -- a conflict that has claimed at least 12,500 lives.
The rebels have formed a loose alliance with mainstream opposition parties against the monarchy and to press for a return to democracy.
Gyanendra said he seized power to quell the insurgency. But his moves have left him politically isolated and analysts say he is nowhere near achieving his goal of ending the revolt.

""We will continue with this series of military actions,"" rebel leader Prachanda, who uses only one name, said in a statement.
The warning comes after a battle in central Nepal on Saturday described as the fiercest fighting since a cease-fire collapsed last year.
Hundreds of rebels swarmed into Beni, a mountain town 280 kilometers (175 miles) west of Katmandu, the capital, and battled security forces for nearly 12 hours before being chased away by reinforcements.
Army spokesman Col. Deepak Gurung said the army has taken control of the area and is hunting the rebels from both land and air.
The government said its forces killed as many as 500 rebels, but the guerrillas said they lost only about 40 fighters.
Eighteen soldiers and policemen were killed and 18 others were injured, Gurung said. Rebels attacked the town's jail, bombed the district administration office and set fire to the police station.
Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said the rebels were victorious in the battle, capturing many government security officials and taking many modern weapons from them.
There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims.
Fighting between the rebels and government soldiers has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire in August and broke off peace talks. The two sides failed to break an impasse over the rebels' demand for a special elected assembly to draft a new constitution and decide whether Nepal's king should continue as a constitutional monarch.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace the monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

  Singh is carrying a ""strong message"" to the King, stating that multi-party democracy needs to be restored if the popular unrest in Nepal was to end.
  Singh is popularly known as the 'Jamai' (bridegroom) of Kathmandu. His wife is Princess Yasho Rajya Lakshmi, grand daughter of' Maharaja Mohun Shumsher Rana, the last Rana prime minister of Nepal.
  ""I have brought good message from India for the King, and best wishes from the people,"" Singh told newspersons at the Tribhuvan International Airport, adding that he was optimistic that his meeting with the monarch would help restore peace.
  Accompanied by Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and India's ambassador Shiv Mukherjee, Singh urged the seven-party alliance of political parties to stay united to ensure a return to democracy.
  Saran also met chief of the Royal Nepalese Army Pyar Jung Thapa on Wednesday. The RNA, has close links with the Indian Army and has supported the monarch's efforts to retain power after he took direct control of the government on February 1, 2005.
  The RNA has managed to ensure relative peace in Kathmandu till date. But it has a difficult task ahead as the SPA plans to lead a mass rally into Kathmandu on Thursday, defying curfew and prohibitory orders.
  The Maoists on Wednesday appealed to the people to gather in large numbers, while asking them not to pay any tax. Analysts feel the mass pro-democracy demonstration would bring the confrontation sweeping the Himalayan kingdom to a head.
  Meanwhile, the local media kept speculating about Singh's ""magic formula"" for Nepal. The inquisitiveness only grew stronger when even Koirala refused to talk about the outcome of his meeting with Karan Singh.

In a report earlier Wednesday before the latest deaths were announced, one of Nepal's leading human rights groups said at least 39 people had died and 25 others disappeared since the rebels ended the truce on August 27.
The Informal Sector Service Centre said the rebels had killed 22 people and the security forces the other 17.
The Maoists broke the seven-month ceasefire after the government refused to set up a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa's government Monday announced a 22-day ban on public meetings and demonstrations in the capital Kathmandu and two neighbouring cities due to the surge in violence.
The major political parties -- which reject Thapa's authority as he was appointed by King Gyanendra and not elected -- plan a rally Thursday in Kathmandu in defiance of the ban on public assembly.

"412",20032146,"Title: Rebel leader warns of confrontation in Nepal.rtf; Date: September 9, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai warned Tuesday of confrontation between the rebels and security forces in Nepal after the breakdown of the peace process.
""A head-on collision between the regressive and progressive forces would be unavoidable and a victory of the progressive forces is a foregone conclusion, at a high cost though,"" Bhattarai said in a column in the English daily The Kathmandu Post.
Bhattarai, in his first public comments since the rebels pulled out of a ceasefire on August 27, said the main reason for the collapse of peace talks was the refusal of the government to draft a new constitution.
""The most significant hurdle was the obstinate unwillingness of the old regime to go for a new constitution and its ridiculous stand to introduce reforms through amendments to the old moribund constitution of 1990,"" he said.
""A cursory glance at the two political proposals put forth by two warring sides at the negotiating table… would suffice to bring out a huge gap between the two political positions,"" he said.
Bhattarai, the chief rebel negotiator who led his team to three rounds of talks earlier this year, said a free and fair election to a constituent assembly, which would redraft the constitution, would have been the best compromise for the monarchy, political parties and the rebels.
""It is quite ironic that both the monarchist and pro-parliamentarian forces, who swear by the sovereignty of the people and multi-party democracy, have chickened out of going to the sovereign people to elect a constituent assembly, and thus precipitated a bloody civil war in the country,"" Bhattarai said.
The two sides had held two rounds of talks in April and May, but the delayed third round in August broke down over the issue of the constituent assembly and days later the rebels announced they were pulling out of the truce which had been in place since January 29.
Since then there has been an increase in violent incidents blamed on the rebels, including shootings, bank robberies and a series of bomb blasts in Kathmandu on Monday, which left a schoolboy dead.
Also on Monday, army sources claimed up to 100 rebels could have been killed in a huge battle with security forces in western Nepal.
Bhattarai, who had come out of hiding for the first time in seven years during the ceasefire, also said the real power in the Himalayan kingdom was centred in the monarchy and Royal Nepalese army.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.

    BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) is  a stubborn advocacy group for ""Tibet independence"" supported by  the Tibetan ""government-in-exile"", which upholds complete violence  and has become an armed spearhead of the 14th Dalai Lama group,  says a senior Chinese Tibetologist. 
    The TYC was set up in 1970 under the ""direct incitement of the  Dalai"", said Bi Hua, a senior researcher with the Beijing-based  China Tibetology Research Center (CTRC), a research institution  established in 1986. 
    Bi said that in the early 1970s, some Tibetan youths ""in exile""  became decadent and tired of life, as either independence or  returning to China was hopeless years after they fled the country.  The group was established against such a backdrop. 
    The Dalai Lama and major officials of the ""government-in-exile""  had attended the TYC's inauguration ceremony in 1970 and  encouraged Tibetan youths to pursue Tibet independence ""with  resolution and courage"". 
    Bi said the Dalai Lama intended to break geographical shackles  and resolve conflicts among sects via the TYC so as to move  Tibetan youths and train his successors. 
    The TYC constitution's chapter four clearly stated that  extensive movement should be organized ""even at the cost of blood  and life"" to achieve the independent goal, said Bi. 
    The organization affiliated to Dalai Lama supporters, rapidly  spread to major Tibetan outposts in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Britain,  Canada and the United States in the 1980s and sprouted 81 branches  worldwide covering more than 30,000 members, he said. 
    Eighty percent of the staff of the ""government-in-exile"" were  TYC members. More than 60 key members joined the ""government"" and  assumed major posts since 1980s, he said. 
    In 1993, six of the seven Kalons (Ministers) in their executive  body came from the TYC. Samdom, the current principal Kalon, and  Gyarig Lozhoi Gyaincain, were members of the organization when it  was newly founded, he alleged. 
    Bi said the TYC organized many activities to achieve their  independence goal. The annual March 10 protest against the Chinese  government was typical. It included violent assaults on overseas  Chinese embassies and consulates, or means of protest such as  sit-ins and hunger strikes. 
    Bi said the organization also commemorated the the Dalai Lama  birthday (July 6), the anniversary of the Dalai Lama's acceptance  of the Nobel Peace Prize (Dec. 10) and ""Democratic Day"" (Sept. 2),  Bi said. 
    Bi alleged that the TYC former president Cedain Norbu told  ""pro-democracy movement representatives"" during an interview in  2002 that they would use various measures, including terrorism, to  achieve independence. 
    Previously, many TYC presidents and secretary-generals had  claimed, ""armed struggles and violence was the only way to  independence"" and ""terrorism could achieve maximum effect with  minimum cost"", said Bi. 
    Bi said the organization exposed its violent nature in many  events such as the 1974 incident in Bhutan. In that year, in order  to turn Bhutan into a forefront against Tibet, the Dalai Lama  group plotted to upset the Bhutan government, but the plan was  thwarted and 28 suspects were seized by the Bhutan police when  Dalai's people prepared to set a palace on fire and assassinate  the King. 
    Bi said Tibet Autonomous Region had long been considered by the  TYC as a major battlefield. The group planned and directly  participated in the Lhasa riots in 1987, 1988 and 1989 as well as  the March 14 riot. 
    The day after the March 14 Lhasa riot, the TYC approved a  decision to ""found a guerrilla movement as soon as possible to  secretly enter China and carry out armed struggles"" at a meeting  of its ""central executive committee"" in Dharmsala, the location of  the Dalai Lama's ""government-in-exile"" in India, said Bi. 
    They made detailed plans about personnel, fund and armament  purchase, and planned to smuggle into China via the border with  Nepal, which they had carefully surveyed, said Bi.   
    TERRORISM 
    CTRC senior Tibetologist Liu Hongji told Xinhua that the  pro-independence group had actively engaged in training its armed  forces and reserve troop. They also sought mutual support from  international terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida and East  Turkistan groups. 
    Liu said that this year the TYC had organized training  sessions, such as one on ""dynamite techniques"" and another on how  to carry out violent and terrorist activities. 
    ""The TYC has become a terrorist organization as concepts of  violence have taken root in the organization,"" said Liu. 
    He said that from the late-1980s Lhasa riots to March 14  incident, the TYC was behind the scenes organizing and  masterminding these events.

"7165",20082756,"Title: The Man who told the Kosi sutra.rtf; Date: September 13, 2008 Saturday 4:16 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Sept. 13 -- Dinesh Kumar Mishra is a busy man these days. He has been following the twists and turns of the Kosi river for more than 20 years. Now he has published Trapped! Between the Devil and Deep Waters, The Story of Bihar's Kosi river and journalists are making a beeline to scribble down as much information on the floods raging in north Bihar from Mishra as possible.
Is he going back to Ground Zero soon? ""Yes. But this is nothing new. It's the national media that has suddenly developed interest in this,"" he says, quickly adding that he hopes that this spotlight will ignite a debate on what he has been saying for decades now: embankments along Kosi have led to such crises, and no dam in Nepal will solve this recurring problem. About 380 villages in Bihar are trapped between the two embankments of Kosi and around a million people are subject to its onslaughts every year. This time, it just happens that we sat up and noticed.
""A dam won't control the silt-laden waters. Moreover, the catchment below this proposed dam gets good showers and the water from this area will threaten downstream areas,"" argues Mishra, an IIT Kharagpur civil engineering alumnus. But despite such devastation wrought by the river every year, Mishra is against calling Kosi Bihar's 'River of Sorrow'. ""The British called it so because when Kosi was in spate, revenue collection used to be a problem. But even they never jacketed it. The local people continue to adore Kosi,"" he points out. British administrator Charles Elliot, he says, once said that if there is anything that could be said about the behaviour of Kosi, it is uncertainty. ""But our engineers sought a quick-fix solution initiated by their political masters,"" he laments.
Many would think that Mishra comes from Bihar and that recurrent floods compelled him to take up 'the cause'. He laughs at the notion. He points out that he's from the 'Abu Salem town', Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. It was just a coincidence that got him interested in Kosi. ""A close friend of mine, Vikas, once asked me to go to flood-hit Saharsa to compile a report. Reluctantly, I agreed. I reached the place and was completely taken aback by the amount of water I saw. I was sent again after six months to do a larger report on rivers of north Bihar. To do that, I had to read newspapers from the 1940s. And I discovered that everything that we had been told about the floods were lies, lies, lies. After that, there was no turning back,"" he recalls.
So how effective has the state government's disaster management plans been? ""I met the Bihar Disaster Management Minister Nitish Mishra on August 5 when Kosi had started cutting the spurs,"" he says. ""Mishra was enumerating all that his government had done. But the present situation tells a different story"". He points out how the government has changed the name of departments. ""'Irrigation' has become 'Water Resources', 'Relief and Rehab' has become 'Disaster Management'. But the character of these departments has remained the same.""
His years of ground-level experience and intensive research are captured in the book in a clear-headed manner. Starting from the scriptures, it includes the legends of Kosi, folklores, history of attempts to tackle floods in India, the efforts and 100-year-old debates to tame the river, the decision-making and construction process, scams and their outcomes and aftermath. It is also littered with voices of people who have been affected by the Kosi and by administrative attempts to 'fix' the Kosi problem.
Before the meeting, one expected to meet someone agitated at the turn of the events brought about by faulty planning. But Mishra, unlike his muse, the Kosi, turns out to be calm, collected and logical - something that is reflected amply in the book he has written.

The officials, reached by telephone, said the policemen were on patrol in the village of Dhankhola, where rebels are known to operate. The vehicle hit the mine, and the rebels opened fire.
The civilians who died were on a bus right behind the police.
Dhankhola is 250 miles southwest of the capital Katmandu.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives.
The fighting has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last August.

The demands by the communist rebels in the Birgunj area, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of the capital Katmandu, have closed factories for the past three days, said the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industries.
""These industries have been shut because of the extortion demands and other threats by the Maoists,"" said Sushil Mittal, the chamber's vice chairman.
Mittal said the rebels were willing to negotiate and a meeting was to be held later Sunday.
News reports Sunday said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala called the rebel chief Prachanda on the telephone Saturday and urged him to stop the harassment. The Kantipur newspaper reported Prachanda whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he would issue an order to his cadres to halt the extortion demands.
The Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries, in a statement published in newspapers on Sunday, alleged the rebels were demanding large sums of ""donations"" and had threatened managers if they didn't pay, which led to the shut downs.
Since launching their insurrection in 1996, the rebels have extorted money from people and businesses to support their fight. The practice has continued despite the announcement of a cease-fire earlier this month and an agreement to enter peace talks with Nepal's new government.
About 13,000 people have died in the decade-old insurgency.

Not only do they plan to boot out the king, who is still viewed by many as the reincarnation of a Hindu god, they also want to dismantle the 240-year-old monarchy and turn royal palaces into museums.
Moreover, the former rebels want to overturn what they view as a wider, ""feudal"" caste-ridden system, vowing sweeping land reforms and an end to the impoverished country's reliance on foreign aid and remittances by overseas workers.
""We are now in an epoch-changing time,"" Maoist leader Prachanda told jubilant supporters as the scale of his party's performance at the ballot box began to emerge after last Thursday's elections.
According to the latest figures, the Maoists are on track to win an absolute majority, based on one-third of seats in a new 601-seat constitutional assembly already declared or close to being allocated.
The new assembly will be tasked with rewriting the constitution and deciding how to tackle a wealth of problems facing one of the world's poorest countries, and the Maoists will be in the driving seat.
A look at the party manifesto hints at what their first moves could be, assuming they get past the first task of kicking out King Gyanendra -- who still has powerful allies in the national army.
""Revolutionary land reforms will be implemented where the land will be owned by those who plough the fields,"" promises the election manifesto. ""We will end the practice of land being owned by feudal landlords.""
This would entail tearing land from wealthy landowners who have held sway for generations over the country, which was closed to the outside world until 1950.
The Maoists, who fought a deadly insurgency for 10 years, also say they will improve economic conditions so that young people do not have to go overseas for work.
But they do not lay out any plans for getting Nepal's economy back on track.
In addition, they say they want to accept development aid on their own conditions, and to ""end the tradition of taking loans and grants based on the interests and conditions set by international foreign institutions and donor countries.""
Nepal, however, relies on foreign aid for 25 percent of its annual budget.
The Maoists are happy to welcome tourists, with the industry a crucial part of the economy, but apparently dislike British army visitors and say they want to put an end to recruitment for the fabled Gurkha regiment.
The one billion dollars sent back annually by an estimated two million overseas workers -- including maids in the Middle East and security guards in Iraq -- is the only thing that has prevented a complete economic meltdown in the impoverished country, economists say.
Kundan Aryal, editor of the weekly Himal magazine, said the ultra-leftists are facing a formidable foe in Nepal's conservative establishment.
""They have brought this concept of new Nepal where there will be a federal structure, no monarchy, a restructured army, the existing bureaucracy changed and power decentralised to a grassroots level,"" said Aryal.
""All of these groups are dominated by powerful elites. The Maoists will face a strong fight against them as they still have large political influence.""
Despite the strident communist rhetoric in the manifesto, Prachanda took a conciliatory tone when he addressed journalists after winning his seat in the capital.
Observers predict that even assuming their election victory is confirmed as more results roll in, the Maoists may choose to tread carefully.
""There are many things that they had to put in the manifesto but that might not actually come about,"" a Kathmandu-based Western diplomat told AFP on condition he not be named.
""But now they are in politics, and in the end they are going to have to compromise.""

Santosh Nepali hit back the equalizer for Army during stoppage time to put a brake on Jawalakhel's bid to extend its winning run to five matches. Nepali hit a powerful shot from the arch of the box to earn a point for the departmental team that has been eyeing its second victory in the league.
Earlier, Laxminath Shrestha had given a 53rd minute lead to Jawalakhel in the match affected by heavy downpour. An unmarked Shrestha headed home from the box in a cross of Kenyan striker Gerard Mukonza.
Following the draw, Jawalakhel remained unchanged in second position with 13 points in its kitty, behind Laxmi Hyundai Manang Marshyangdi Club (MMC) who beat Machhindra Club 3-0 earlier in the day. Despite having equal points as that of Jawalakhel, MMC leads the table on the basis of goals superiority. A victory could have put Jawalakhel on top of the standings.
Army also remained unchanged in 10th position with five points while Machhindra is three places behind Army with two points.
In the competitive match, both Army and Jawalakhel crafted some attractive moves. In the 21st minute, Tek Bahadur Budhathoki's strike in Tanka Basnet's pass sailed high above the bar. Two minutes later, Jawalakhel replied to Army's attack when Thomas Wangira Biket's powerful free-kick from near the center went out hitting the crossbar.
In the 39th minute, Nawayug Shrestha's feeble acrobatic shot from close range was denied by Jawalakhel custodian Dinesh Thapa. Six minutes later, Bishal Rai's (Jersey No 9) header from his namesake's pass sailed inches above the bar of Army's post. A minute later Army glovesman Bikash Malla made a brilliant save when he blocked a close-range shot from Mukonza.
Army coach Dambar Singh Gurung said that his team was slowly gaining momentum. He also lamented the lack of strikers. ""Strikers Bikarna Shreshta and Deep Lama could not play today due to injuries and I had to test defender Ram Kumar Biswas in the forward line-up,"" Gurung said. Gurung's counterpart Kishor KC said that he was satisfied with the team's performance.
In the earlier kick-off of the day, South Korean coach Lee Tae-Ho achieved victory in his first match in charge of MMC as Santosh Sahukhala netted twice after Anil Gurung had put the team ahead. Gurung opened the scoring for MMC three minutes before the interval to stun Machhindra goalie Ibrahim Bashir. Gurung made a diving header near the goalline in the goalie's rebounder off Bijay Gurung's shot. Sahukhala doubled the scoring two minutes into the second half through penalty after Bobby handled the ball in the box in a bid to defend Sahukhala's strike.
Sahukhala, who had previously scored five goals in the league, scored his second goal on 55 minutes to take his tally to seven goals. He is now the second highest scorer after Jumanu Rai of Nepal Police Club, who has scored 10 goals. Sahukhala gave a finishing touch to beat diving goalie Bashir from close range in a brilliant pass of Sujal Shrestha.
Machhindra which is seeking its first win in the league could not create more than a couple of moves. However, the sixth position finisher in the last edition coming up with four foreigner players put up an improved show as compared to previous outings.
In the 42nd minute, Ezee Collins' powerful header in Naresh Pokharel's corner was caught by MMC custodian Bishal Shrestha.
MMC coach Tae-Ho said that he was satisfied with the performance though the team failed to deliver cent percent his expectation. ""The level of Nepali league is higher than what I heard in Korea,"" Tae-Ho said through an interpreter. He also said that MMC has high chances of winning the league.
Machhindra coach Tshering Lopsang, the former coach of MMC, said that the second goal conceded through penalty became the turning point of the match. ""The boys' morale was down after conceding the second goal,"" said Lopsang, who expressed satisfaction at his team's performance. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 2 September
Kathmandu, 2 September: Security personnel, Maoists and some NGOs have started rescue work and distribution of relief materials for landslide and flood victims in the western and far-western districts. In Achham, security personnel and the Maoist ""People's Liberation Army"" are working jointly in the landslide-hit areas including Khaptad and Devisthan VDCs [village development committees]. As the villagers are in danger of being hit by another landslide, APF Armed Police Force] personnel, Nepal police and PLA [People's Liberation Army] men are working round the clock in the area.
Security men and the PLA have established a rescue camp at Balayat village of Khaptad VDC. Forty security men have been deployed under the command of police inspector Bishnu Dutta Abasthi while 29 PLA personnel have been deployed in the same area by the seventh division of the Maoist army. The Maoists also have deployed a 21-member rescue committee in the landslide-affected area.
They are working together in search of those who went missing and also on sanitation, construction of roads and paths, and treatment of the injured. All of them are working as per decisions taken through all-party agreements, said local Devendra Rawal.
In Banke, the Nepali Army (NA), APF, Nepal Police and some NGOs have started the resettlement of flood victims and distributing relief goods since Thursday [31 August]. Flood victims who had been shifted to the Jhora jungle have been settled in makeshift shelters put up in the area. Security personnel are putting up tents for those who had earlier been airlifted from Chauferi and Simrahana of Holiya VDC, the worst affected in the flooding. Over 300 flood victims of these villages were left to their own devices for the last five days.
In Bardiya, Amin Tharu, 60, from Nawaranga of Manau VDC, 55 kilometres west of district headquarters, died of diarrhoea that has spread in the flood-affected areas of the district. Some 1,500 locals in the flood-affected areas suffering from diarrhoea, fever, eye infection and other ailments were provided treatment, according to Rama Shankar Deep, chief of the district health office. Recently an average of 30 to 40 patients have been visiting the district hospital, said assistant health worker Ambar Khadka.
Flood victims in the Mahammadpur Bhadapul area Friday brought vehicular movement to a complete halt for an hour in protest against dillydallying in providing relief goods. Meanwhile, Rural Reconstruction Nepal, an NGO, and Nepal Red Cross Society distributed some relief goods to 80 families from Dhobiya and Jagatiya villages. Altogether 29,743 people have been affected by flooding in this district alone, according to the Red Cross.
Victims in need of humanitarian assistance: Kahane [subhead]
Meanwhile, Mathew Kahane, UN resident coordinator, Friday [1 September] stated that thousands of flood victims were urgently in need of humanitarian assistance. Kahane was speaking to journalists in Nepalgunj upon arrival back from an inspection-visit of flood-affected areas in Banke and Bardiya districts. He informed that UN bodies were ready to provide more assistance to the victims.

BEFORE McMansions, before the counterculture was granite and marble, there was Lloyd Kahn, champion of the hand-built house, a road-kill-skunk skin warming his chair, a chin-up bar suspended from the rafters.
 For 35 years, Mr. Kahn, 69, has been a steadfast chronicler of offbeat owner-built shelter: straw and mud houses, solar-powered houses, geodesic domes beloved by hippies (of whom Mr. Kahn was one) and made from chopped-up cars pounded into submission and bent into triangles.
  From his head (covered with a visor to conceal a receding hairline) to his toes (dusty and protruding from Birkenstocklike scandals he made by taking a drywall knife to his running shoes), Mr. Kahn is a believer in, and an appreciator of, homemade architecture, as varied as floating homes in Hong Kong and Mongolian yurts. In the 1970's, he was a hero to ''back to the landers,'' who drew inspiration from his first book, ''Shelter,'' an ebullient homegrown survey of alternative housing around the world that grew out of the ''Whole Earth Catalog,'' where he was the shelter editor.
 Now, from his home down a brambly dirt road with no name in Bolinas, the self-consciously reclusive coastal village in Marin County, comes ''Home Work: Handbuilt Shelter'' (Shelter Publications, 2004), his latest ode to humankind's ability to create, often virtually out of nothing, expressive and in some cases profoundly bizarre dwellings.
 ''The process makes you different,'' Mr. Kahn said of building one's own house, which he has done four times. ''Anything you make yourself is your own.''
 In a sense, Mr. Kahn and his wife, Lesley Creed, a gifted gardener and quilter, have stepped out of the pages of his own book. Their woodsy compound, where bantam chickens roam, is presided over by a 30-foot-tall hexagonal tower, its windows plucked from chicken coops. It is the lone remnant of a geodesic dome -- ''the most beautiful dome ever built,'' as Mr. Kahn put it, which he constructed in 1971, heady with the ideas of the visionary builder R. Buckminster Fuller. He dismantled the dome four years later in disenchantment and eventually renounced domes altogether in a diatribe titled ''Refried Domes,'' self-published on newsprint and distributed throughout the dome underground.
 Life magazine had featured the dome in a 1972 article titled ''Room Galore but Hard to Subdivide.'' Mr. Kahn told the magazine, ''In an ordinary square house, vitality sits down and dies in corners.''
 ''I was young and foolish,'' he now says, citing the leaks that the domes were prone to, and their impractical shape. ''You shouldn't make building a house a trip.''
 Nevertheless, ''Home Work'' is rife with trippy 1960's-style characters, who seem to have spent the interim marinating in formaldehyde. Perhaps only Mr. Kahn, a specialist in obscurity, whose bookshelves are lined with titles like ''African Spaces: Designs for Living in Upper Volta,'' could discover people like Louie Fraser, whose house on the Mendocino coast is approached by swinging on a cable over a river. Or Ian MacLeod, a Scotsman living in South Africa, who was inspired to build his house while entirely in the nude because his hillside adjoined a nudist resort.
 Then there is the potter who is also a massage therapist and runs a belly dance troupe on the side. (She lives in a tepee, natch.)
 But for every zome -- a house in the shape of a rhombic viacontahedron -- Mr. Kahn also celebrates unsung vernacular structures like Kickapoo wigwams and Nepalese monasteries. He implicitly makes connections between handmade dwellings, wherever they may be and regardless of maker, and those put up by people who opt out of the mainstream, linking the structures through the warmth and character he sees in them.
 Though unheralded by scholars, Mr. Kahn ''kicked off the appreciation of the worldwide vernacular,'' said Peter Nabokov, a professor of world arts and cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''He combined 60's values, especially an appreciation of appropriate technology, with ethnic cultures -- the esthetic pleasures of the found, ignored and jury-rigged.''
 By bearing witness to the communal values of the 1960's and editing the countercultural classics ''Domebook One'' and ''Domebook 2'' in the early 1970's, Mr. Kahn also became, perhaps inadvertently, a social historian. In ''Shelter,'' he invited the Red Rockers, a dome commune, to reflect on their second thoughts. ''After years of lying in a heap,'' they wrote, ''most of us have decided that in order to keep becoming new people, to keep growing and changing, we need more privacy.''
 His latest book showcases numerous homes destined to make Park Avenue decorators weep, among them Timolandia near San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico, an undulating concrete fantasy house with the architectural intensity of a ravenous boa constrictor.
 Mr. Kahn's inclusive spirit grew out of the literature of the Whole Earth period, along w"

Issuing a statement after their meeting, the four parties said the practice of running the government through a nominated Prime Minister without the mandate of the people had clearly failed.
 The meeting also discussed the Maoists demand to hold talk to the King with the help of United Nations facilitation. However, the four parties have said an official view on the issue will be made public after another meeting of the four parties next Tuesday [7 September]. The parties have also decided to launch regional protest programs in Bagmati from the 21st of this month.

"3813",2005886,"Title: Supporters of jailed former prime minister clash with police in Nepal.rtf; Date: August 4, 2005 Thursday; Text: About 2,000 supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba clashed with police and blocked traffic in the Nepalese capital on Thursday to protest his conviction on corruption charges.
Traffic on major roads in Katmandu was blocked during the morning rush hour as protesters burned tires and piles of wood.
Supporters threw bricks at police who responded with batons at two places in Katmandu, leaving at least two supporters bleeding.
The clash lasted about an hour before police were able to clear the streets.
Last month, an anti-corruption commission appointed by King Gyanendra found Deuba and former Cabinet Minister Prakash Man Singh guilty of embezzlement and sentenced them to two years in prison and a fine of 90 million rupees (US$1.2 million; [euro]990,000).
They were convicted of misusing 370 million rupees (US$5.3 million; [euro]4.4 million) in connection with a road-building contract.
The commission was set up by the king after he sacked Deuba and his government, threw several Cabinet ministers into prison and seized absolute power on Feb. 1. The king said the measures were needed to quell a nine-year communist insurgency and stamp out corruption.
The conviction has been widely criticized both in Nepal and by key foreign allies.

"370",20031562,"Title: Prince Charles talks to Indian president, meets Tibetan beauty queen.rtf; Date: October 29, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Britain's Prince Charles on Wednesday spent his first full day in India since visiting with his late wife Princess Diana 11 years ago meeting with India's president and attending a fashion show by Tibetan exiles.
At the British-built presidential palace, Charles met President Abdul Kalam, the architect of India's ballistic missile programme, for 40 minutes of talks officials described as ""cordial and constructive.""
The prince last visited the palace when he and Diana stayed there during their six-day trip to India in February 1992. The tour reinforced talk that their marriage was on the rocks as the couple preferred separate bedrooms in the 340-room Rashtrapati Bhavan.
The couple divorced in December 1992.
On Wednesday Charles also addressed Indians who have studied in Britain, saying the two countries shared a long history, and inspected New Delhi's metro service which started limited operations in December.
India was a colony of the British empire until its independence in 1947.
""This extraordinary bond has deep historic roots but is acutely modern in many of its manifestations and that modern relationship is driven by a healthy and shared perception that both countries have a lot to gain by building it further,"" he said.
""India and the United Kingdom are trading with each other and investing with each other as never before and I am told that bilateral trade grew by an astonishing 16 percent in the first six months of this year,"" he said.
The first of Prince Charles' nine days in India ended on a politically poignant note when the prince drove down to Majnu Ka Tilla, or Lover's Hill, on New Delhi's outskirts at the invitation of Tibetan exiles who live in the area.
Tibetan men and women staged a boisterous fashion show and presented skits as Miss Tibet 2003, Tsering Kyi, curtsied to the heir of the British crown who sat clapping and smiling.
""Your Highness, we presented the past of Tibet, the modern progresses we have made and we wish we could stage such a show in free Tibet with you as our chief dignitary,"" a Tibetan commentator said.
Tens of thousands of Tibetans followed their spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to India in 1959 after Beijing crushed an abortive anti-Chinese uprising in Lhasa.
Charles, who flew in Tuesday, will also tour the desert city of Jodhpur and Jaipur, where Diana publicly deflected a kiss from him after he won a game of polo there in 1992.
His previous trip ended disastrously when Charles left India for Nepal and Diana flew to the Indian city of Calcutta to meet Mother Teresa and then returned home alone.
His latest visit comes just after the release of the tell-all book ""A Royal Duty"" by Diana's former butler Paul Burrell, which reveals that Diana thought somebody was plotting a car crash against her. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997.

"471",20031756,"Title: Daughter of rice farmers is the first Thai to reach a summit of Himalayan mountain(2).rtf; Date: January 7, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Growing up in the rice paddies of tropical Thailand, the farmer's daughter used to shinny up tamarind trees to gather the sweet fruit - the higher the climb, the better.
Over the years, Kingkaew Buatoom's passion for climbing has taken her higher and higher - from the foothills of northern Thailand to the majestic peaks of Nepal.
In November, she became the first Thai to reach a summit in the icy, wind-whipped Himalayas when she held her homeland's flag atop the 6,189-meter (20,305-foot) Island Peak, accompanied by her American husband.
""I don't like the cold,"" says the 36-year-old Kingkaew, who had never seen snow before her first trip to Nepal in 1995. ""I prefer hot weather, but I want to climb mountains - the high places.""
The driving force behind her achievements has been her husband, Dr. Charles Mitchell of Honolulu, a 57-year-old physician with a penchant for adventure who has accompanied Kingkaew on all her climbs.
When Mitchell met Kingkaew in 1990 at Doi Suthep, a mountain popular with tourists in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, she had hyperthyroidism - a disorder of the thyroid gland that leads to weight loss and nervousness - and didn't have the strength to exercise.
After they moved to Hawaii in 1992, he encouraged her to try aerobics classes to make her stronger. Now, she says, she's addicted to fitness, going to the gym at least four times a week to exercise and lift weights.
The couple, who married three years ago and have no children, lead an active outdoor life during their time off from medical jobs for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
With a slender, solid frame, Kingkaew became a skilled rock climber. Following the lead of her husband, who has been hiking since the 1980s, she embraced the mountains as well.
The Nepal Mountaineering Association says Kingkaew is the first Thai to climb Island Peak, but some say she might be the first person from her country to reach any Himalayan summit.
Kingkaew's guide, Pema Dorjee, who has been a mountain guide in the Himalayas for 26 years, told The Associated Press that he and his colleagues had never come across any other Thais climbing in the Himalayas.
""I checked climbing permit records (going back the last two decades) and didn't see any Thai who has been on the Himalayas, let alone Island Peak,"" said Dorjee, who has climbed Mount Everest three times.
Thailand does not have a mountaineering association, and there are no records of its climbers.
Although Island Peak, also known as Imja Tse, is the most difficult climb she has done, it is not the highest point reached by Kingkaew. In 1997, she climbed to the 7,000-meter (23,000-foot) North Col - the low point on one of the three great ridges on Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
Her ultimate goal is the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit of Everest. There is talk of her joining a National Geographic-sponsored celebration in Washington, D.C., with Sir Edmund Hillary to mark the 50th anniversary of his reaching the top of Everest on May 29, 1953, with his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay.
Kingkaew grew up in a village in Phayao province, 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Bangkok, which didn't have electricity until 1985. A neighbor's 17-inch (43-centimeter) black-and-white television, powered by a car battery, provided the village its only images of the world outside.
""We lived in the dark,"" says Kingkaew, her face splitting into a grin to reveal braces on her teeth.
As the eighth of nine children, Kingkaew's schooling ended with sixth grade, then the highest level that was free. Her parents couldn't afford for her to continue her education, so she worked with them in the rice paddies.
""I didn't like exercising or running because it was tiring. We used to just work and live,"" she says.
Her family and friends are a bit perplexed by her adventures, she said, then recounted a phone conversation with her septuagenarian father in 1997 after her climb to Everest's North Col.
""I was so excited, but he just said: 'Why did you do that? Climb a mountain? What a waste of money, what a waste of energy. Why do you have to make your life so difficult? There are lots of mountains here,""' she said.
""I know it costs so much, but it's worth it. I can remember each minute of these trips as time ticks by.""

Several hundred people chanting slogans against Islamic extremists marched to the Egyptian embassy, which handles Iraqi interests in the Himalayan kingdom, a police official said.
Embassy guards shot two of the protesters who fell to the ground and the crowd dispersed, the official said The wounded men were rushed to hospital but their injuries were not life-threatening, a doctor said.
The incident happened before a curfew went into effect in Kathmandu at 2:00 pm (0815 GMT) that largely silenced the streets after a morning of rioting.
Angry mobs set fire to Kathmandu's largest mosque and the office of an airline office and ransacked employment agencies which protesters accuse of putting the workers in harm's way in Iraq.
Islamic militants released a grisly video Tuesday showing the killing of 12 apparently Nepalese men in the largest single massacre of hostages in Iraq since the start of the US-led war there last year.

"4663",2006905,"Title: ADDRESS NE ISSUES WITH SENSE OF URGENCY.rtf; Date: January 22, 2006 Sunday 1:09 PM  EST; Text: HYDERABAD, Jan 22 -- Without directly spelling out a strategy to the UPA Government on tackling insurgency in the North-East, the Congress Party has urged the Centre to focus on the region with a sense of urgency. The draft political resolution of the Congress Party has a paragraph on the region but it has kept itself confined to broader issues concerning the North-East refraining from taking any stand vis-?-vis the peace processes and the illegal immigration issues. The resolution, on the other hand, has asked the UPA Government to accord top priority to the Naxal problem, particularly on the linkages with the Maoist movement in Nepal.
  The day two of the mega event saw adoption of four draft resolutions by the AICC, which has converted itself to Subjects Committee. The resolutions would be forwarded to the Plenary for discussion and adoption. Bishnu Prasad of Assam Congress spoke on the Economic Resolution.
  On the dais, however, were several leaders from the North-East including the Chief Ministers of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, Arunachal Pradesh, Gegong Apang, Manipur, Ibobi Singh, Meghalaya, DD Lapang, besides Omen Deuri, among others. The obituary reference included the names of three Congressmen of Assam including Nakul Das, Deva Chandra Deka and Samsul Huda.
  ""The Indian National Congress believes that economic support and expansion of infrastructure of roads, hospitals, schools are important and so, indeed, is the infrastructure of security in these sensitive areas. The Congress Party urges the UPA Government to address the matter with a sense of urgency and calls upon the Congress units in the northeastern States to enthusiastically participate in this exercise,"" the resolution said.
  ""The Congress welcomes the UPA Government's renewed attempts to tackle unrest, insurgency and militancy in the northeastern States. The important issue is to give signals of the significance of North-East to Indian polity despite the distances and the relatively small populations. If the aspirations of all the people of the North-East pose challenges to political and administrative structures they also provide a rich treasure house of social identity that enriches the concept of India,"" said the resolution.
  The North-East is a sensitive area and a comprehensive and a well-thought-out policy needs to be adopted, which linked education and health care to the common men. The attempt is to create a new atmosphere in the region, Human Resources Development Minister Arjun Singh said while moving the resolution.
  On the internal security, the political resolution said that there was a marked deterioration in the internal security situation during the BJP-led NDA Government's rule. The UPA Government has approached the subject with clarity, determination and sensitivity. It is in fitness of things that the UPA Government's attitude towards events that caused damages to life and property was to fight with great courage and determination, rather than succumb to pressure.   
  On Naxalism, the Congress Party without ruling out possible involvement of unfriendly foreign forces, advocated a tough stand. The involvement of unfriendly foreign forces cannot be ruled out.
  Meanwhile, participating in the discussion on the Economic Resolution, Bishnu Prasad said that it talked about removal of economic imbalance and recently the Prime Minister went to Assam and announced a package of Rs 6,000 crore mostly in the power sector. The package would go a long way in removing the economic imbalance of Assam and the north-eastern States, he asserted.
  Adding that not only the present Prime Minister, but also late Rajiv Gandhi had also announced the Accord Refinery and the Guwahati IIT.
  The draft Economic Resolution said that Congress noted with satisfaction many new initiatives that have been taken for the faster economic development of the North-East and Jammu and Kashmir.
  The resolution on the External Security and International Affairs referring to ASEAN said that UPA Government was diligently pursuing the policy of enriching the relations with ASEAN, such as actively participating in the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation that brought together India with five ASEAN countries. However, the resolution skirted any mention of Bangladesh.
  Meanwhile, the Gogoi-baiters have kept a low profile at the conclave and have so far not made any move to kick up dust. Known dissidents like Sarat Borkotoki, Devananda Konwar and Dr Ardhendu Dey along with their supporters are participating in the meeting.

"3186",20044017,"Title: And What Did the Teacher Do During Vacation_.rtf; Date: May 16, 2004 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final
TEACHERS have long been the envy of the working man, leaving work at about 3, summers off. But little is what it seems. Following, find 10 teachers and their summer adventures, from teaching on a trash heap and training all summer to teach in the fall, to avoiding bulls on Ireland's pathways and discovering the idiosyncrasies of endangered sea turtles.
Months as a Missionary
 In the early 1980's, Christina LaRosa was teaching Spanish at Middletown High School. One day she picked up a magazine. The page fell open to a Maryknoll Mission advertisement that read, ''What are you doing this summer? Do you have time to serve God?'' She sent away for a catalog of missionary opportunities throughout the world, interviewed with the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus in New York and was hired for a summer position in Mexico. 
  ''My first summer was an eye-opener,'' said Mrs. LaRosa, who was single at the time. ''My job was to teach the children who lived in the garbage dump. My first few days I cried a lot. I had a lot of trouble understanding why I was born in Middletown in a house with running water and lots of shoes, and these kids were living in cardboard shacks, picking the garbage to sell it and trying to find food and clothing in the trash to eat.'' 
 Her classroom was a blue tarp atop rotting garbage. The next summer, Maryknoll was able to buy land at the dump. In following summers, Mrs. LaRosa helped build a school, digging a latrine, hoisting 125-pound bags of cement and teaching students how to read and write in Spanish and converse in English. After 10 years, the local government recognized the garbage-dump community, providing financial support. Full-time teachers were assigned to the school, another building was built, a pre-kindergarten program was begun.
 Mrs. LaRosa continued to teach after her marriage seven years ago. ''I have to say 'thank you' for everything I have by giving time, and as a teacher, that time is the summertime,'' Mrs. LaRosa said. ''Those summers were my professional development. I just did mine in a garbage dump.''
In the Rainforest
 Heather Lloyd took an ecology course the summer before her senior year at the University of Connecticut that required her to hike the Amazon rainforest. The guide for her group, Judy Logback, talked about a craft cooperative, Kallari, a Kichua word meaning ancient, that she had founded to create international markets for hand-woven goods made by the indigenous peoples of the area. 
 Ms. Lloyd's interest was piqued. 
 ''The people were so generous with us, giving us their best food when they don't have that much to give, and it made me want to do something that could contribute,'' she said. Now a first-grade teacher at Hebron Avenue School in Glastonbury, Ms. Lloyd is an advocate for the crafts cooperative, selling the goods at Manhattan street fairs and at home shows that are much like Tupperware parties. She travels to Ecuador each summer and is now collecting information and materials to develop a unit for American students to learn about the forest cultures and the ways in which the rainforest affects climate. 
 ''I want children to understand how the rainforest is beneficial to the human race,'' she said. ''I initially went because I wanted to see monkeys in the forest and pretty mountains. And I came back and my life was changed.'' 
Hiking Ireland
 Myles Cohen, a guidance counselor at Flood Middle School in Stratford, has spent the last two summers hiking with his wife, Mary Cohen, in Ireland. They carried what they needed on their backs until nightfall, walking the lush, remote Beara Peninsula from one bed and breakfast to the next. 
 ''We wanted to go to a country that speaks English in case we got lost,'' he said. They relied on a compass and the weather for safe passage. ''You're talking Ireland, which has a huge amount of rainfall and a lot of the paths are not easily discernible and the fog rolls in and you can't see in front of your face,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''My wife fell in a bog. She looks wonderful in black.'' 
 The friendliness of the Irish people gave them their biggest thrill. 
 ''The farmers come out from their farmhouses carrying their address books, and say 'Look, we know someone in Connecticut,''' Mr. Cohen said. Bulls shared the narrow pathways of the peninsula with the slightly alarmed couple. ATM machines were hard to find. 
 This summer, they are off to Switzerland, to challenge the altitude, between the bed and breakfasts.
Vacancy at the Inn
 Bill Berghoff teaches physics and chemistry at Choate-Rosemary Hall in Wallingford during the school year and supervises a dormitory of 30 boys. His wife, Tina Berghoff, teaches hearing-impaired children in a birth-to-3 program in Wethersfield. They live with their three elementary-school-aged children in an apartment connected to the dorm. As if they didn't have enough to do keeping an eye on folks during the school year, the couple bought a bed and"
"5702",20061460,"Title: Nepal plans to hold constituent assembly elections by mid-April _PM.rtf; Date: July 19, 2006 Wednesday 11:22 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's government plans to hold elections to a body to redraft the constitution before the end of next April, the country's premier said in a letter to the United Nations released Wednesday.
""As we plan to hold the election to the constituent assembly by the end of the current Nepali year (mid-April 2007), I would be grateful if you could start extending the necessary support of the United Nations,"" Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said in a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan sent on July 3.
The letter marks the first time the government has publicly given a time-frame for the constituent assembly elections.
The staging of the ballot is a key demand of Maoist rebels, who Wednesday  pledged to continue observing a truce with the Himalayan nation's recently reinstated government.
The two sides have been observing a ceasefire since weeks of street demonstrations forced King Gyanendra in late April to reinstate parliament and give up the direct power he had seized 14 months previously.
The protests, which left 19 people dead and hundreds injured, were organized by sidelined political parties and Maoists who formed a loose alliance last November.
Following the ceasefire the two sides agreed to form an interim government containing rebels to run the country before the constituent assembly elections.
Koirala listed five points on which they would like UN assistance, including ""monitoring of the combatants of the Maoists and decommissioning of their arms"" and monitoring that the army stays in barracks and remains neutral.
In addition, Nepal requested continued human rights abuse monitoring by the UN and urged it to observe the election to the constituent assembly.
Since the rebels began their ""people's war"" in 1996, at least 12,500 people have been killed and some 200,000 displaced.

 Text of unattributed report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 2 May
 Kathmandu, 1 May: The five political parties have said that the government had lifted the state of emergency just to save face from national and international pressures. In practice, restrictions on liberties are still continuing, they said.
 The parties said that dictatorial rule was in place despite the lifting of the state of emergency. They announced on Sunday [1 May] that their movement for the restoration of full democracy will continued.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 2 May 05
""The state of emergency was lifted just to placate the national and international community,"" said a joint statement issued by the five parties. ""In practice, however, various kinds of bans continue to be in place. Political leaders and workers have not been freed. Rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins and mass meetings have been prohibited.""
 Five parties reached this decision after holding discussions one day after the lifting of emergency.
 The parties have said that the announcement made in paper alone cannot be believed. They have made appeal to support their movement for full democracy.
 ""We appeal the Nepalese people and the world community to cooperate the parties until full democracy is attained,"" says the statement. The statement was jointly issued by Nepali Congress [NC] President Girija Prasad Koirala, acting general secretary of CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist-Leninist] Jhala Nath Khanal, NC-Democratic acting President Gopal Man Shrestha, Himlal Puri of Jana Morcha and Anil Kumar Jha of Nepal Sadbhavana Party-Anandi Devi.
 The five parties said that the king is not willing to return the country to a democratic setup. We cannot assume that there is democracy when there is autocracy and until the elected bodies of the people are reactivated, they said.
 Immediately after the emergency was lifted, press censorship had been imposed for the next six months, the parties have objected.
 The government is still not sensitive towards the issue of human rights as proved by the facts that arrests, issuance of arrest warrants and detention without basic humanitarian facilities are continuing, the parties have said. They have alleged that the Royal Commission for Control of Corruption was out to malign political leaders.
 ""The commission, which was constituted against constitutional norms, should be dissolved immediately. This goes against the norms of the rule of law,"" the statement said.

Doordarshan DDTV news channel, New Delhi, in English 1500 gmt 1 Feb 05
King Gyanendra, in Nepali with on-screen English translation The king and the public can together bring the country together. We have to be one in this hour of crisis. Violence, killing has to be stopped. There has been misuse of power, which is not be as received good to the country. There was an attempt to overthrow the constitution of the country.
 Correspondent The monarch also accused Deuba of not being able to put machinery in place for the April elections. Taking the reigns into his hands for the next three years, King Gyanendra said there would be no elections till then. Deuba, on his part, termed the king's action anti-democratic even as a large number of political leaders have been put under house arrest. All communication links from Nepal have been snapped and international flights to Kathmandu diverted. However, road links between India and Nepal are still open.
 Democracy had always been shaky in the Himalayan kingdom, as the monarchy was always uncomfortable with elected governments. Gyanendra, who was in throne following the killing of his brother, Birendra, dismissed four governments in three years. After assuming the throne in 2001, he dismissed the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2002. The king installed his loyalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand to quit next year to give way to another loyalist, Surya Bahadur Thapa. Thapa was removed in 2004 and Deuba reinstated as prime minister by the king following widespread protests in the country. However, within eight months, Deuba has been dismissed again and the monarch has assumed power. Nepal has had no parliament since 2002. Bureau report, DD News.  End of recording
 And India has reacted strongly to the developments in Kathmandu. Expressing concern at the dismissal of the Deuba government, New Delhi today said it is a setback to the democratic process in Nepal.
 Unidentified correspondent - recording Political developments in Nepal have caused grave concern in New Delhi. The External Affairs Ministry said the removal of the Deuba government brings the monarchy and the mainstream political parties into direct confrontation with each other.
 External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna These developments constitute a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal and cannot but be a cause of grave concern to India. There are also reports that several political leaders have been confined to their residences. The safety and welfare of the political leaders must be ensured and political parties must be allowed to exercise all the rights enjoyed by them under the constitution.
 Correspondent India said the king had violated Nepal's constitution by assuming powers unto himself.
 Sarna India has consistently supported multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy enshrined in Nepal's constitution as the two pillars of political stability in Nepal. This principle has now been violated with the king forming a government under his chairmanship.
 Correspondent All flights from India to Nepal have been cancelled. Arrangements are being made to pick up stranded Indians in the country.
 Indian Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel Indian Airlines or other international airlines flying into Nepal from India and other countries have suspended their flights on being advised by the Nepali authorities that no departures from Kathmandu airport are being permitted for the time being. The safety of our passengers and aircraft is of prime concern to us. We are constantly monitoring the situation and flights will resume as soon as the Nepali civil aviation authorities convey that normal operations can resume.
 Correspondent External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh briefed the prime minister on the latest developments. Dr Manmohan Singh was also briefed on the volatile situation in Bangladesh where the opposition forces are fighting with the police. The latest developments in Nepal and Bangladesh have cast a doubt on the forthcoming SAARC South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit at Dhaka. Either the head of government or its nominee should be present at the SAARC summit as per the SAARC charter. There is no information from Nepal on this count. A high-level security team had gone from Delhi to assess the situation in Dhaka. It would be known only then whether the SAARC summit would be on or n"
"4571",20063641,"Title: Nepal 's rebel leader comes out from shadows.rtf; Date: November 8, 2006 Wednesday 9:08 AM GMT; Text: It has been a long journey for shadowy Maoist rebel leader Prachanda, from the rugged jungles of Nepal into the political spotlight.
But with his rebels set to join a new interim government after clinching a historic peace deal with the ruling seven-party coalition early Wednesday to end a decade-long insurgency, the former teacher will be seen a lot more in public.
The mild-mannered smiling Prachanda -- whose assumed name means ""fierce one"" -- appears to have little in common with the man critics call a ruthless leader, responsible for deadly attacks and executions during the revolt that claimed at least 12,500 lives.
For others in Nepal, Prachanda is a hero who took up arms to improve the lives of millions of poor in one of the world's most impoverished nations.
Born into a high caste but poor farming family 52 years ago, Prachanda -- whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- was a ""brilliant"" school student and gained a degree in agriculture, according to a profile in weekly news magazine Nepal.
But the massive poverty he witnessed in rural Nepal spurred an interest in politics and he moved politically to the left.
""From his high school days he had a growing interest in politics and one of his neighbours was a communist activist who inspired him to become a communist,"" the magazine said.
Married with three children, his interest grew in far-left communist groups that emerged in the country in the late 1960s, after the father of the current King Gyanendra banned political parties.
The chaotic Cultural Revolution in neighbouring China inspired him, as did Peru's Shining Path Guerrillas, who also took their inspiration from the revolutionary theories of Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong.
In 1996, he went underground and, although he never fought in combat himself, became chief military strategist of a group of rebels committed to a ""Marxism-Leninism-Maoism"" ideology.
Although their ideology appealed to Nepal's low caste, women and ethnic minority groups, the rebels also used indoctrination, intimidation, murder, kidnapping and extortion to cement their control, human rights groups said.
From a rag-tag collection of a few dozen fighters with home-made weapons, Prachanda built up a fearsome force that took control of large swathes of the Nepalese countryside.
Prachanda, who speaks fluent English, claimed to have dismantled feudalistic practices in villages under Maoist control. But a cult of personality started to emerge in 2001, and he was revered as a demi-god by some supporters.
His ""Prachanda Path"" was touted as a new form of communism.
Initially the rebel leader said his aim was to make Nepal into a communist republic, but now he has tempered these demands, saying he is willing to take part in a multi-party democratic system.
""We are 21st century communists. We are not dogmatic. We are trying to develop our line, policy and programme for the changed situation,"" Prachanda told AFP in a recent interview.
""We have seen revolution and counter-revolution in the 20th century, and Stalin's experiment failed. We do not want to repeat the same phenomenon,"" he said.
Prachanda was a shrewd political operator, according to Lilamani Pokhrel, a friend and vice chairman of the People's Front Nepal, a small political party.
""I have known Prachanda since my college days and he is a good politician,"" Pokhrel said recently.
The key now for Prachanda and his followers was whether they could ""act as normal political players"", a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

DAOs across the country are required to submit details of registered weapons in their respective districts to the MoHA voluntarily by the end of every fiscal.
A copy of the weaponry details prepared on mid-July 2010 by MoHA and obtained by Republica states not only remotely-situated districts like Manang, Jumla, Kalikot, Mugu and Dolpa but districts like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur have also not submitted their reports so far.
Likewise, Tarai districts, including Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara, Parsa, Dang and Banke have also not submitted the details.
The government permits citizens to keep weapons of four categories -12-bore gun, 22-bore rifle, homemade and air gun - for personal security after accessing the requirements. It stopped granting license for small weapons like pistol and revolver since 1996 when the Maoist insurgency began.
MoHA Spokesperson Jaya Mukunda Khanal said the ministry has been doing a follow up on its requests. ""Let's hope the details will arrive soon,"" Khanal told Republica.
Ratna Raj Pandey, chief district officer of Lalitpur, said the DAO has maintained an up-to-date record of registered weapons in the district. ""We can provide such details without delay if authority concerned makes a formal request,"" Pandey told Republica.
11,053 weapons in total
According to the MoHA data, 11,053 weapons were registered in 33 districts until mid-July, 2010. Of them, 4,554 are 12-bore guns, 1084 22-bore rifles, 4955 homemade guns, 134 air guns, 87 pistols and 53 revolvers. Similarly, number of uncategorized weapons is 186.
While Kaski has the largest number of weapons (1,459), Nuwakot possesses least number of weapons (12). Kapilvastu, Sankhuwasabha and Kailali are the second, third and fourth largest weapon-possessing districts with 1,079, 1,040 and 1,016 weapons respectively.
Top five possessors of small arms are Parbat, Kailali, Kapilvastu, Saptari and Kanchanpur districts and they respectively have 37, 26, 21, 16 and 9 such arms.

"7018",20081511,"Title: Surging food prices bite across Asia.rtf; Date: May 11, 2008 Sunday 3:24 AM GMT; Text: From the rice paddies of Asia to the wheat fields of Australia, the soaring price of food is breaking the budgets of the poor and raising the spectres of hunger and unrest, experts warn.
A billion people in Asia are seriously affected by the surging costs of daily staples such as rice and bread, the director general of the Asian Development Bank, Rajat Nag, has said.
""This includes roughly about 600 million people who live on just under a dollar a day, which is the definition of poverty, and another 400 million who are just above that borderline,"" he said.
Globally, the World Bank last month estimated that 33 countries were threatened with political and social unrest because of the skyrocketing costs of food and energy.
Across Asia, workers made a campaign against high food prices their May Day battle cry last Thursday in marches through cities including the capitals of Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.
While the demonstrations were mainly peaceful, concern is growing over the potential for political instability and unrest if high prices persist.
""Once people get hungry they start also getting quite desperate and take desperate measures,"" Damien Kingsbury of Australia's Deakin University told AFP.
India's top farm scientist and architect of the 1960s ""Green Revolution,"" Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, has said India needs a second agricultural revolution to boost food supplies or face huge social turmoil.
Experts blame the high food prices on a confluence of factors, including increased demand from a changing diet in Asia, droughts, the rising use of crops for biofuels, and growing energy and fertiliser costs.
In Australia, which usually ranks second after the United States as a global wheat exporter, several years of drought cut harvests to just 13 million tonnes last year from an average of 22 million tonnes.
So while consumers are struggling, Australian farmers are not getting rich on the backs of the poor, said National Farmers Federation chief executive Ben Fargher.
""It's been the worst drought in our history and many, many farming families are under significant financial and emotional stress and it will take our communities a long time to recover,"" he said.
And even in a relatively prosperous country like Australia, people are feeling the squeeze in the supermarkets, prompting the government to launch an inquiry into how to stem rising grocery prices.
Around the rest of the region, the impact varies from traumatic to minimal:
-- AFGHANISTAN: Millions of Afghans are finding it ""problematic"" to meet their basic food needs with prices of the staple, wheat, doubling in some areas over recent months, the World Food Programme has said.
About 400 people demonstrated in eastern Afghanistan last month, blocking a key road linking the eastern town of Jalalabad to the capital Kabul and demanding the government step in to control prices at food markets.
-- BANGLADESH: One of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh has been hit by a doubling in the price of the main staple, rice, in the past year and many low paid workers say they have been forced to make do on only one meal a day.
Last month about 20,000 garment workers rioted near the capital Dhaka for higher wages to cover food prices. 
-- CAMBODIA: Soaring rice prices have forced the World Food Programme to indefinitely suspend a programme supplying free breakfasts to 450,000 poor Cambodian schoolchildren.
-- CHINA: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told a meeting of the State Council last month that high prices were the biggest problem in the domestic economy.
""The inflation is led by food price rises, which especially hurt the poor,"" said Ma Qing, a Beijing-based analyst with the CEB monitor group. ""So the pressure (on maintaining social stability) is certainly quite large.""
The finance ministry announced a special 100 percent duty on exports of fertilisers and the raw materials used to make them in order to ensure domestic supply over the ploughing season and ""guarantee this year's grain harvest"".
-- INDIA: A general strike against spiralling food prices paralysed Kolkata on April 21 as thousands of police were deployed across West Bengal state to stop protests turning violent.
New Delhi has already slashed food duties and banned exports of lentils and other staples, and will not hesitate to further ""sacrifice revenues to control prices,"" Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said.
-- INDONESIA: Anger over rising food prices was a focus for some 10,000 Indonesians who took to the streets of the capital Jakarta for Labour Day rallies.
High prices for rice, cooking oil and soybeans helped drive Indonesia's annual inflation rate to 8.17 percent in March.
-- JAPAN: In resource-poor Japan, which relies on imports for 60 percent of its food, companies have hiked prices on everything from beer to beef, mayonnaise and ""miso"" paste made from fermented soy beans in recent months.

"3966",20051360,"Title: Nepal lifts house arrest of former deputy prime minister and frees 59 political prisoners.rtf; Date: April 22, 2005 Friday; Text: Authorities have freed a former deputy prime minister from house arrest and released 59 other political prisoners from jails across the country, police and the state news agency said Friday.
The move comes a day after human rights group Amnesty International accused Nepal's government of detaining more than 3,000 political prisoners since King Gyanendra sacked the government and seized power in February.
Bharat Mohan Adhikari, the deputy prime minister up until February, had spent 81 days under house arrest. He was prohibited from meeting his supporters or using the telephone. He was freed Thursday night, police said.
The report by the National News Agency, the government's mouthpiece, said that 59 other ""political activists"" had been freed but gave no other details.
Most senior political leaders in Nepal were detained in prisons or under house arrest soon after the king grabbed power and imposed a state of emergency. Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was freed from house arrest last month.
The prisoner release happened while the king was in Indonesia where he hoped to use a meeting of world leaders at the Asia-Africa Summit to rally support and explain why he took power. Several nations have strongly condemned the monarch's takeover.
Amnesty's report said several political prisoners had been tortured. It also said that under the state of emergency, levels of violence appear to have escalated, with grave human rights abuses committed by both government troops and Maoist rebels. The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy.

""If the talks fail we will go back to our old place and follow our old ways again,"" said Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna, state secretary of the Peoples War Group (PWG) who is leading the Maoist team.
The group has been fighting for more than three decades for the economic and social benefit of landless peasants and indigenous tribal people in southern Andhra Pradesh and adjoining states, leaving more than 10,000 people dead.
""We have come with faith and hope that the (state) government will address our demands of distributing land to landless farmers. We also want an end to exploitive anti-poor conditions laid on the people by the World Bank,"" Haragopal said.
In July, the government of Andhra Pradesh lifted a ban on the organisation and offered peace talks to the warring rebels. The first face-to-face meeting is due on Friday.
On Monday, in a symbolic gesture, the rebels, who have been hiding for almost two decades, changed out of their battle fatigues and handed over their assault rifles to colleagues who then went back into the jungles.
Haragopal and others arrived in state capital Hyderabad early Tuesday, said R.P. Singh, police commissioner of Hyderabad.
""They are being treated as state guests and we are making all security arrangements to ensure their full safety,"" Singh told AFP.
Hargopal said there was also a need for all leftist revolutionary groups in the country to unite.
""The need is to have one revolutionary party in India. Therefore we are already on talks with the MCC, Janashakthi and other such groups,"" he added, naming the other violent groups active in the region.
Haragopal also spoke of the PWGs links with the Maoist groups in neighbouring Nepal where a bloody struggle has left thousands dead over the last few years.
""We have close ideological links with them and we support their struggle. However, this talk about a physical corridor that links the Indian Maoist groups to comrades in Nepal is a creation of the media,"" he said.
After coming out in the open, the rebel leaders addressed a large gathering of followers in Guttikonda Bilam, 300 kilometres (188 miles) southeast of Hyderabad late on Monday.

 For the last week journalist Shakti Kuman Pun has been detained by the security forces in Rukum district. Pun, a reporter for the daily Rajdhani, was arrested by the security forces during a military operation in rebel stronghold areas.
Center for Human Rights and Democratic Studies (Cehurdes) press release, Kathmandu, in English 21 Dec 04
The daily Nepal Samacharpatra had previously reported in its 24 November 2004 edition that the rebels - and not the security forces - had taken Pun into custody for a 35-day period, along with six other people including schoolteacher Lal Bahadur Gharti. It was reported at the time that the seven individuals had been detained by the rebels for assisting the security forces in the arrest of five Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-Maoist) rebels from the district's Rugha Village Development Committee.
 In a separate incident, on 20 December, an unidentified group of people abducted journalist Ganesh Khanal from his newspaper's office in Banepa. Khanal is a reporter for the weekly Susandesh, published in Banepa, Kavre district, east of Kathmandu.
 According to a press statement issued by the weekly's editor, Yadunath Gautam, the kidnappers are seeking a ransom of 5,000,000 Nepal rupees (69,945 US dollars). Gautam added that Khanal spoke with his brother, Prakash Khanal, while he was tied to a tree at an unknown location in the district.

"453",20031553,"Title: Bhutanese refugees in Nepal stone government team.rtf; Date: December 22, 2003 Monday; Text: Bhutanese refugees who have spent more than 13 years in a Nepalese camp threw stones Monday at a joint team set up by the two kingdoms to arrange repatriation, injuring four, a local official said.
The assailants were apparently upset they were not among 12,000 out of the 100,000 refugees who Bhutan has agreed to allow back, an administrative official dealing with the Khudunabari camp said by telephone.
Four members of the team, which is studying refugees' documentation, were slightly injured and four vehicles were damaged, he said.
Nepalese foreign ministry spokesman Madan Kumar Bhattarai said the situation had returned to normal at the camp.
The refugees, who are mostly Hindus of Nepalese descent, fled Bhutan in 1990 after the Buddhist kingdom imposed cultural reforms that promoted the use of the Bhutanese language and national dress.
Bhutan denies an ""anti-Hindu"" agenda and says most of the people left voluntarily.
But amid criticism of its position by the United States and European countries, Bhutan agreed in October during a 15th round of negotiations to take back 12,000 of the refugees starting in February.

"6161",200728,"Title: Roundup_ Cold wave hits normal life in Nepal By Rajeeb Tamrakar, Zhang Jianhua.rtf; Date: January 5, 2007 Friday 3:00 AM EST; Text: A sharp drop in temperatures for  the last week and thick fog caused by the cold wave have thrown  life into chaos in various districts in the terai region of Nepal.
    The cold snap triggered by the western disturbance, a thick  layer of fog traveling from the Himalayas in India towards east,  has so far claimed at least 27 lives, mainly across the southern  plains of terai belt.
    According to local newspapers, a total of nine persons died on  Thursday alone while five others, including an Indian national  succumbed to the severe cold in Rautahat District, some 200  kilometers south of Kathmandu, on Wednesday.
    Meanwhile, many patients suffering from cold related  complications have started flocking local hospitals and viral  diarrhea and pneumonia were blamed for the deaths. Most of those  killed by the cold snap in last few days are elderly people.
    ""At least 30 persons affected by pneumonia and viral diarrhea  are coming for the treatment everyday,"" a source at Siraha  District Hospital told Xinhua.
    The deepening chill since early morning has slowed down the  daily life across the region, which particularly affected daily  bread earners like the rickshaw and wooden cart pullers as the  business in major trade centers across the India-Nepal border went down and also resulted in substantial decrease in the number of  travelers. They were seen making fire at various parts of the city to keep themselves warm in the open.
    Among others worst hit by the cold snap were the farmers of the region as vegetables like potatoes and onions in the field are  dying due to exposure to heavy fog.
    Several schools in the region witnessed low turnout of children due to extreme cold weather while many private schools along the  India-Nepal border have announced cold vacations.
    Officials at the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM)  expected temperatures to rise steadily in the southern belt of the country by next week as the satellite figure showed that the  Stratus cloud is moving towards east. Stratus clouds are uniform  gray clouds that usually cover the entire sky blocking rays of  sunlight out causing the cold wave in the area.
    Talking to Xinhua, Keshav Bam Malla, Meteorologist at the  Weather Forecasting Division under the Ministry of Science and  Technology said that the Stratus clouds were  gradually moving  eastwards and may even reach the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka by next week.
    Meteorologist Malla said that cold wave in the terai region was caused by a sudden dip in the maximum temperature in the area.  According to a recent data, the maximum temperature of Kathmandu  was 19 Celsius degrees and minimum was 3.3 Celsius degrees while  Biratnagar witnessed 14.3 degrees maximum and 8.5 Celsius degrees  on Wednesday, turning terai region even colder than the capital  city.
    The cold wave, which started from Dec. 28, 2006 as shown by the satellite pictures, is expected to last for approximately two more days in the western part of Nepal while the eastern part will have to wait for one more week to enjoy the warmth of the sun.
    During last winter, over 1,700 people in India, Nepal and  Bangladesh died due to cold wave that lasted for about one month.  Most of those killed were elderly people and children.

"327",20033328,"Title: Roundup_ Poverty escalates suicide rates in Nepal by Wu Haimang, Song Dejun.rtf; Date: November 17, 2003, Monday; Text: by Wu Haimang, Song Dejun
KATHMANDU, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Extreme poverty, prevalent gender inequality and social discrimination are causing more and more suicide cases in Nepal, especially in the last decade.
According to a survey conducted recently by the Sanjibani Nepal, a non-governmental organization, as many as 10,979 suicide cases were recorded in the country during the last 10 years. The year 2002 alone saw 1,246 suicide cases.
""Out of the total, 52.23 percent were related to women, which indicates poverty, discrimination and injustice to women to be the prime cause for committing suicide,"" said the survey.
In a tragic incident happened on Nov. 5 in Birgunj municipality in central Nepal, four members of a family committed mass suicide for being unable to face extreme poverty.
Paramananda Prasad Barai, 38, his wife and his 17-year-old daughter ended their lives by hanging themselves on ceiling fans, while his 65-year-old mother was found dead after having consumed an overdose of poisonous pesticide.
Neighbors said that the Barai family had been fighting a land related suit case with their landlord for the last eight years.
""The prolonged case and the fee to the advocate virtually rendered them bankrupt. In the later days Paramananda was having a hard time making enough money for two square meals for the family, "" a neighbor said, adding, ""Moreover, a local money lender had seized Paramananda's house just a week ago for his failing to pay the money Paramananda had taken from him.""
""The tenant-family was heavily in debt and this could have led them to take such an extreme step,"" he added.
Moreover, many Nepalese people living in the remote villages can not afford the extortion by the anti-government guerrillas in the country. The eight-year-long anti-government insurgency has been further dragging the local people into extreme poverty.
Among some other reasons, ""conflict between modernization and traditional social values has raised the suicidal tendency among the urbanites, because they failed to cope up with the changes that come with urbanization and modernization,"" the survey noted.
The Kathmandu Valley has recorded the highest number of suicide cases among other areas in the country. The Valley Crime Investigation Branch said that altogether 27 people committed suicide in September and the number was 34 in October. On an average, one person commits suicide in the Valley for each passing day.
The survey also found that most of the people committing suicide were in the age group of 15-29. Lack of employment opportunity; social discrimination caused by race, culture and gender; family conflict; failure in love and exams in addition to alcohol and drugs and incurable diseases are also the reasons for suicide cases.

"4775",20065279,"Title: Pro-monarchists win 29 Nepalese mayoral races, remaining 29 won by independents.rtf; Date: February 11, 2006 Saturday 12:56 PM GMT; Text: Nepal announced on Saturday that government-backed candidates won 29 powerful mayoral seats, and another 29 were won by independent candidates thought to support the king, in municipal elections tainted by low turnout, rebel violence and a boycott by major political parties.
Results announced by the Election Commission said candidates from the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party won 25 seats while candidates from the pro-government Nepal Sadbhawana won four.
The remaining 29 were either from very small parties or stood as independents, but many of them are believed to support King Gyanendra, who seized power last year.
The mayoral positions were the most powerful of the more than 4,100 seats available in Wednesday's municipal elections. But less than half of the seats were contested, partly because of threats from Maoist rebels, who were blamed for slaying of two candidates and attacks on several others.
The rebels launched repeated attacks during the campaign and threatened to kill anyone who took part in the elections. Re-elections will be held for the seats not contested, the election commission said, adding that a date has not yet been set.
The election was also boycotted by the major opposition political parties who called it an attempt by the king to legitimize his takeover of the government. The opposition and communist rebels had vowed to disrupt the elections.
The government has claimed the elections were a successful step toward the restoration of full democracy, while key international allies have dismissed it as deeply flawed.
Only about 21 percent of voters showed up for the elections.
The United States called the elections a ""hollow attempt"" to legitimize the king's rule and Britain said the low turnout showed the government did not have public support.
Nepal, however, rejected that criticism, saying foreign governments should ""refrain from making such insolent comments about matters that fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a sovereign country.""
The statement by the foreign ministry said ""the government firmly believes the elections were a clear popular victory against terror that has derailed democracy for years.""
""Demanding democracy and criticizing the polls aimed at restoring democracy is nothing more than a paradox in itself,"" the statement said.
Security, meanwhile, was tightened in southwestern Nepal after the rebels ambushed an army patrol on a key highway in the region, killing at least nine people and leaving 28 security forces missing.
Hundreds of government troops have been transported to a stretch of the East-West highway near Sunwal, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of Katmandu, following the latest rebel assault, said Ram Kumar Khanal, the police chief in the area.
The Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for a decade to create a socialist state, have increased attacks since they pulled out of a cease-fire last month. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.

"7857",20114783,"Title: Nepal seeks amnesty for Maoists sentenced in Patna.rtf; Date: September 14, 2011 Wednesday; Text: KATHMANDU: Nepal's Maoist Prime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai on Tuesday began diplomatic and legal initiatives to obtain amnesty for 11 of his party leaders who were sentenced to jail by Patna high court last week.
The India-educated Bhattarai held an emergency meeting with the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Jayant Prasad, at his office in Kathmandu to ask him to convey to the Indian authorities that the 11 Maoist leaders, who had been found guilty of sedition by Patna High Court and sentenced to two to six years in prison along with varying fines, should be given amnesty in view of the changed scenario in Nepal.
Bhattarai has also begun consultations with the Attorney General, Mukti Pradhan, about the legal complexities and the legal expert was present at the meeting. The premier's media advisor Ram Rijan Yadav said the Indian envoy had said he would look into the legal issues and inform the PM.
During the 10-year People's War fought by the Maoists in Nepal from 1996, their leaders had often sought shelter in Indian cities, held key meetings in India and sought medical treatment in Indian hospitals. In 2004, Bihar Police raided five hotels in Patna and arrested the 11, including a woman, and sent them to Beur Jail.
They were charged with aiding the Indian Maoists and giving them arms trainings for anti-India activities, charges they have denied all along. In 2006, when the Maoists signed a peace accord, the Nepali group was released on bail.
There have been earlier cases of Nepali leaders being convicted by Indian courts but then, after political changes swept the Himalayan nation, being given a clean chit. Nepal's former foreign minister Chakra Prasad Bastola was sentenced by the Arariya court of Bihar for taking part in the hijack of a Nepali aircraft. However, it was forgiven and forgotten and Bastola later became Nepal's ambassador to India.

"1117",20033312,"Title: Thai 'ladyboys' bring woman's touch to elephant polo.rtf; Date: September 21, 2003 Sunday; Text: With her hair pulled back, eyebrows plucked and a fresh dusting of makeup, Phruts Phungsai put down her glossy fashion magazine, climbed atop an elephant and clasped a bamboo mallet, ready for battle.
It was the 22-year-old clothing designer's first time playing elephant polo - a quirky sport modeled after the game traditionally played on horseback that has emerged as a tourist attraction here in recent years.
But Phruts' physique gave her what some opponents called an unfair advantage - she was once a man.
According to the rules of elephant polo, which was invented in Nepal more than two decades ago by a British expatriate, female players are allowed to put both hands on the 2-meter (6-foot) club used to whack a small white ball across the field. Their male counterparts, however, may use only one.
""It's fair because my body is like that of a woman,"" said the willowy transsexual from Bangkok. ""I have small hands, a small body and not much muscle. I look like a woman, so why can't I use two hands?""
Despite the friendly squabbling over rules, Phruts took to the field with her team - the Screwless Tuskers - for their debut match in the King's Cup 2003 tournament.
Chivas Regal is a major sponsor of the event, fielding its own team, while 10 other teams are backed by multinational corporations and local businesses.
The Screwless Tuskers, however, are an independent team organized by Alf Erickson, a retired lawyer from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, who settled in the Thai capital four years ago.
Erickson says he invited Phruts and three other ""ladyboys"" - transsexuals or transvestites - to join the team to bring something ""extremely exotic"" to this year's tournament from Sept. 13-21.
""I told them, the thing is not how well you play, it's how well you look, and that made them happy,"" Erickson said. ""You know, they're girls, in a way.""
Despite being a conservative Buddhist society, Thailand is one of the most tolerant countries in Asia in its attitude toward gays and transvestites. ""Katoeys,"" as ladyboys are called, have featured in Thai films as conquering kickboxers and victorious volleyball players.
Wearing matching pink jerseys, the Tuskers faced tough competition. Among the 12 teams competing in the event are players from Australia, Britain, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand - some of them professional horse polo players.
But instead of riding fleet-footed horses, the players - three per team - marshal lumbering elephants on the field during 30-minute matches.
Twenty-two Asian elephants from Hua Hin and the northern Thai provinces of Lampang and Surin are participating in the event. The animals are fed a total of 7 tons of pineapple tops, bananas, watermelons and vitamins daily.
""They actually enjoy it,"" said 28-year-old Martin Cummings of Thailand's National Elephant Institute. ""They're herd animals, they move together, so they're not doing anything they don't ordinarily do. We're not getting them to ride bikes.""
The NEI will receive an estimated 1.5 million baht (US$35,700) in proceeds from a dinner and auction during the event, which was adapted from tournaments played in Nepal and organized by Jim Edwards, a British expatriate.
""We never thought we'd get past our own amusement level, but now it's developed a following from all over the world,"" said Edwards, who runs an elephant trekking firm in Nepal, his home of 40 years.
""Horse polo is very fast, very dangerous, very skillful with the stick,"" he said. ""Here (it) is just really a lot of fun because you're only as good as your elephant. If your elephant is slow, you're slow.""
Elephant polo players not only rely on their 2-ton mounts, but also on mahouts - or elephant handlers - who sit astride the elephant's neck and give commands.
Still, some competitors insist the game hinges on the skill of their human opponents.
Nopdol Nandabhiwat, a 44-year-old Thai on a team backed by American Express, said the prospect of playing against the Screwless Tuskers ""could be scary.""
""They are allowed to use two hands, which helps a lot,"" he said. ""If they're really men, it's a big advantage because they're quite strong.""
But the Tuskers' two-handed technique was not enough to overpower their rivals. Phruts and her teammates finished the tournament in last place, losing their final match 3-5 against the Q Bar team on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Mercedes-Benz team claimed overall victory for the second year in a row, after winning 5-3 against Chivas Regal, the fifth consecutive win for the team in the round-robin contest.

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who heads the governing coalition, said that the number of electoral constituencies would be raised on the basis of population and geography for the better representation of the southerners in a planned constituent assembly.
In an address to the nation, which he said was perhaps his first and last, the octogenarian premier said that Nepal will be restructured based on a federal system following a constituent assembly election planned for mid-June.
""A new Nepal will be built after an election of the constituent assembly,"" said Koirala, who is also discharging the role of the country's head of state, according to the recently promulgated constitution.
He appealed to the various groups agitating in southern Nepal to stop their strikes and blockades of the highways and instead build a conducive atmosphere for the constituent assembly election.
""Doors are open to all to come forward to hold talks for resolving problems facing the Nepalese,"" he said, repeating his call for the agitators to come to the table for dialogue.
Nepal promulgated an interim constitution Jan. 15 aimed at holding the constituent assembly election.
It, however, drew protests from the Madhesis, people of the flatlands in the south of the country, triggering riots in half-a-dozen towns in southern Nepal.
The interim law ignored their demands of a federal state structure, a mixed electoral system and the delineation of electoral constituencies based on population before the country go to the assembly election, the southerners said.
Eight people died in the protests and riots.

Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of the ancient capital Lalitur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, on Thursday to greet the royal couple.
""Some foreigners are spending a large sum of money to create a chaotic situation in the country,"" Gyanendra told the Kathmandu Valley Development Council after strolling with Queen Komal through the streets.
""You should be aware of this fact and cooperate in restoring peace in the country and in nation building,"" the king said. He did not identify the ""foreigners"" he accused of trying to undermine the world's only Hindu kingdom.
Troops and police were posted at street corners and on rooftops as the king and queen snaked their way through the crowds, stopping to greet well-wishers.
""We feel lucky and thrilled to touch the king's hands while greeting him with bouquets,"" elderly Buddhist priest Pragya Ratna Bajracharya told AFP.
""We believe that touching the king's hand would rid us of our sins of the day,"" Bajracharya said.
The tour of Lalitpur marks the first time the king has strolled among ordinary Nepalese since he sacked the four-party coalition government on February 1 for failing to quash a nine-year-old Maoist rebellion. However the monarch has toured parts of the west of the country.
His walkabout comes at a time of growing street protests against the king organised by an alliance of seven political parties and student groups.
It also comes amid a unilateral ceasefire called by the Maoists in a bid to forge an anti-king alliance with the political groups, who have demanded an end to violence before holding talks with the rebels.
The Maoists have been fighting for a communist republic in the Himalayan kingdom since 1996 in a conflict that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.

The strike has kept Nepal's 7.5 million students from kindergartens to universities out of class since June 6 and wasted some 5.6 million dollars allocated to the schools, an education ministry official said.
He said the deal was reached after the government agreed to remove the pro-Maoist All Nepal National Independent Students Union-Revolutionary, which called the strike, from its list of terrorist groups.
He said authorities also promised to avoid ""indiscriminate arrests and disappearances of students"" which the Maoists allege are commonplace.
The student union's president, Lekhanath Neupane, issued a statement calling off the strike with immediate effect.
""However, our means of pressure remains unchanged and we may resume our actions if the government breaks its commitments,"" he said.
Umesh Shrestha, president of the association representing private schools, welcomed the deal but urged the Maoist supporters to commit against holding strikes in the future.
Some school administrators said they shut down during the strike out of fear of reprisals rather than sympathy for the rebels. An Indian-run school in Kathmandu that stayed open suffered damage on June 9 in an attack by suspected Maoists.
University students have played active roles in political movements in Nepal including the Maoist insurgency, which seeks to overthrow the monarchy.
The Maoists have taken over much of the countryside in their armed campaign and have regularly targetted small-town teachers, who they see as agents of the Kathmandu elite because they follow a centralised curriculum.
The civil war has claimed more than 9,500 lives in the Himalayan kingdom since 1996.

  According to his office, Miura will leave next week for the Himalayas with his son, Yuta. The pair is hoping to reach the 8848-metre-high peak from the Tibetan side on May 16.
  ""The hurdle is high but Lady Luck of Qomolangma is calling me,"" The Australian quoted Miura as saying, using Everest's Tibetan name. 
  ""Ageing is inevitable for humans. But if you have goals in life, you should go through the physical and mental training, forget about age and embark on the challenges,"" he said. 
  If successful, Mr Miura would break the current record for Everest's oldest conqueror, set last year by another Japanese man - Katsusuke Yanagisawa, who was 71 years and two months at the time. 
  Miura is no stranger to the world's highest mountain and last conquered it in 2003. But since then he has undergone two heart operations. 
  His office said the 75-year-old's body would feel twice as old in the conditions on Mount Everest in summer due to low oxygen concentration, low pressure, severe winds and frigid temperatures. 
  Miura was the first person to ski down the popular South Col route of Mount Everest in 1970 by using a parachute as a brake. 
  When he reached the Everest summit in 2003 from the Nepalese side, he was at the time the oldest person to stand on the world's highest spot. 
  After his 2003 climb, Miura suffered an irregular heartbeat and other problems due to ageing and severe climbing activities. 
  Feats run in Miura's family. His father Keizo Miura made headlines in February 2003 when he skied down a run in the renowned Vallee Blanche area of Mont Blanc, western Europe's tallest mountain, at age 99. He died in 2006 at age 101.

"1088",20033070,"Title: Bad weather scuttles UNHCR official's investigation in Nepal.rtf; Date: January 23, 2003 Thursday; Text: The inspector general of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in Nepal to investigate alleged sex abuse at Bhutanese refugee camps, left Thursday after bad weather prevented him from reaching the site.
Dennis McNamara returned to Geneva from Kathmandu to meet prior appointments after dense fog prevented him from visiting the UNHCR-run camps in Jhapa, 286 kilometres (186 miles) southeast of the Nepalese capital, said UNHCR official Melita H. Sunjic.
However, two other UNHCR members who came with him, Vincent Cochetel and Diane Goodman, left for the camp Thursday to go ahead with the inquiry into sexual abuse against refugee women and girls.
At least 18 cases of abuse have been reported at the camps since June 2001, allegedly perpetrated by policemen and workers for non-governmental organizations.
More than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese descent have been living in seven camps in the Jhapa area since 1990, when they fled Bhutan alleging an anti-Hindu campaign.
McNamara held separate talks Tuesday with Nepal's Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shaha and Home Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa to discuss the sexual abuse allegations.
McNamara also met with NGO representatives in Kathmandu and urged them ""to take appropriate disciplinary and criminal actions against the alleged perpetrators of sexual- and gender-based violence that included girls as young as seven years of age,"" the UNHCR said in a statement.
It said the UNHCR in Nepal had also made internal changes in light of the sex abuse scandal and ""put in place a new system to try and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.""

 Kathmandu, 6 May: The World Bank has agreed to provide Nepal with loans and incentive grants for the handover of public schools to local communities in the country from the end of June this year, according to a World Bank official based here.
 ""The bank is set to provide 100,000 Nepali rupees (about 1,300 US dollars) each to public schools as loans, and it is also initially providing incentive grants to 1,300 public schools in the target districts across the country,"" The Kathmandu Post newspaper on Tuesday quoted Rajendra Dhoj Joshi, chief of the Education Section at the World Bank, as saying.
Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 0254 gmt 6 May 03
The World Bank is providing loans to 250 public schools initially, he said.
 ""Project preparation is underway and it will be implemented by the end of June or the first week of July,"" he added.
 The Nepali government announced a plan in February this year to transfer the management of 26,000 government-aided schools to the local communities within the next few years. The government is in absolute control over the management of the public schools, which resulted in a continued deterioration in the quality of the education.

King Gyanendra broke his silence over the polls to tell the nation he was supporting Thursday's elections -- comments seen by observers as a last-ditch attempt to reverse Nepal's march towards becoming a republic.
""It has always been our desire to ensure that under no circumstance are the nation's existence, independence and integrity compromised,"" said Gyanendra, the big loser of a peace deal with Maoist rebels that ended a decade of civil war.
""We call upon all adult citizens to exercise their democratic right in a free and fair environment,"" he said in a rare statement.
King Gyanendra -- viewed by his supporters as a Hindu god -- looks likely to be the last in his 240-year-old line after an unsuccessful period of direct rule ended in April 2006 when rebel Maoists and mainstream political parties united to lead nationwide protests against him.
Since the enforced climbdown, the monarch has been stripped of most of his powers and the interim government agreed last December that the monarchy would be formally ended at the first meeting of the body to be elected Thursday.
Bhasker Gautam, a political analyst and author, said that the king's message was ""an attempt to give the impression that he is in favour of democracy.""
""He is trying to retain and expand his political space by attempting to show he is concerned about common people,"" Gautam said.
Gyanendra came to the throne in tragic and bizarre circumstances in 2001 after his nephew, a drunken, lovelorn crown prince, gunned down most of his family and then killed himself.

The detainees included four Chinese women, two Eritrean women and a man and woman from Nepal, an Egyptian security official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media.
The group had paid hundreds of dollars to human traffickers to help them cross Egypt's border into Israel, the official said. They were caught about 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Rafah, the main crossing point on the Egypt-Gaza border, he said.
Egyptian guards, firing shots into the air, chased the migrants along the border before they surrendered, the official said.
The Sudanese man, Armenary Sinat, broke away from the pack and ran toward the border's barbed wire fence, when the Egyptian guards opened fire and killed him, the security official said.
Sinat, 50, died from bullet wounds to the neck and right shoulder, said Imad Kharboush, head of the emergency unit at el-Arish hospital, where the victim's body was transferred. Kharboush said he received an order from a military prosecutor to carry out an autopsy.
On Saturday, Egyptian border guards shot and killed an Eritrean woman and arrested her two young daughters after they also tried to cross illegally into Israel, security and medical officials said then.
Israel estimates that 2,800 people, mostly from Africa, have entered the country illegally through its border with Egypt in recent years searching for jobs.
The number shot up last summer, apparently as word spread of job opportunities in Israel and a more lenient policy toward refugees. As many as 50 people arrived each day in June, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

"4222",2005714,"Title: India expresses concern over Deuba's arrest.rtf; Date: April 27, 2005 Wednesday 3:23 PM  EST; Text: New Delhi, April 27 -- India has expressed concerns over the detention of former Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other political and student leaders.
  ""The Government of India is deeply concerned at the re-arrest of the former Prime Minister, leader of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) Sher Bahadur Deuba, whose arrest took place early morning. We are concerned about the arrest and detention of political leaders, student leaders and workers of political parties continues as do the restrictions on travel and movement of academicians, human rights activits and students, contrary to assurances. We believe that these developments would further complicate efforts for conciliation between the political parties and the constitutional monarchy in Nepal,"" Indian foreign office spokesperson Navtej Sarna told reporters in New Delhi.
  Earlier, Deuba was arrested from his residence early this morning on alleged charges of corruption. 
  Deuba a week ago had refused to appear before a Royal  Corruption Control  Commission  (RCCC) for questioning over  allegations  of committing  irregularities in the multi-million  dollar  contract dealing with the ADB-funded Melamchi Drinking Water Project. 
   ""This commission is being formed with the intention of political vendetta. This is an unconstitutional Royal Commission. There is no reason to give statement (to this commission). Our party, including me and my friends' opinion is the same. This (commission) is formed with the intention of character assasination of politicians, mud slapping ... That's why I won't give statement (to this commission),"" Deuba told reporters an hour before his arrest.
  According  to Nepali Congress spokesman Minendra Rijal, around  2 AM   armed   policemen   arrived   at   Deuba's   residence    in Budhanilkantha,  10  kms  from here and  took  him  into  custody forcefully. Policemen cut off all communications and  electricity connections before they entered the house, he added.
  The  commission was set up by King Gyanendra just after  he  took over  the  power on February 1. There are other charges  also  on Deuba of distributing unauthorised funds to party workers.
  ""The  action  was inhuman"", said Rijal. There is  no  information about the whereabouts of senior leader, he added.

"2185",20043120,"Title: Bomb rips through bank, one Maoist dead as rebel strike grips Nepal.rtf; Date: September 28, 2004 Tuesday 7:54 AM GMT; Text: A bomb ripped through a bank in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu and a suspected Maoist rebel was shot dead Tuesday as a guerrilla strike shut down shops and transport in much of the Himalayan kingdom.
The blast shattered windows of the Nepal-Bangladesh Bank and of several houses at Lalitpur on the capital's outskirts but caused no casualties, police said.
They described the attack as a scare tactic to enforce the two-day stoppage called by the Maoists, who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy.
""Two Maoists in a taxi stopped at an engineering college outside the bank and left a bag of explosives, which the driver threw out causing the blast. We think the goal was to blow up the taxi,"" Lalitpur Chief District Officer Thaneswore Devkota said.
""This was an attempt by the Maoists to scare people into observing their strike,"" Devkota told AFP.
In the southeastern Ilam district, troops shot dead a Maoist activist who was threatening shopkeepers, police official Krishna Basnet said.
Suspected rebels stopped and set ablaze 10 vehicles in the central Dhading district. They were headed to Kathmandu as part of a month-long tour of Asia by activists lobbying for land rights for peasants.
Police said the attackers did not harm the 19 activists and five journalists on the People's Caravan for Food Sovereignty, who were mostly from other Asian countries.
The Maoists also claim to be fighting on behalf of the rural poor but were upset that the activists were defying the strike, a police officer said.
The guerrillas, who enjoy free rein in much of the countryside, have been building pressure on the government which has tried unsuccessfully to resume talks to end the insurgency that has claimed 10,000 lives since 1996.
Most stores remained closed in Kathmandu and other cities in eastern Nepal and long-distance bus services were halted. But police said there was more traffic on the roads of the capital than during past Maoist strikes, which saw a complete shutdown.
The government had threatened to withdraw official cars from public employees who observed the stoppage.
The rebels in past strikes have destroyed cars whose drivers defied their orders. The home ministry has promised to compensate 90 percent of any damages inflicted during the shutdown.
Streetside vendors also defied the strike Tuesday, which fell on the second day of the Kumari harvest festival. The Maoists have pledged not to interfere with the five-day pageant which is a major tourist attraction.
The tourist industry had appealed for the strike to be called for. Tourism supports 1.25 million jobs in the cash-strapped Himalayan kingdom.
The Maoists called the strike Tuesday and Wednesday to protest at the alleged killing of two senior rebels by troops on September 3. An army spokesman denied troops killed the pair.
In August the guerrillas ordered traffic not to enter or leave Kathmandu for a week, sending prices of fresh produce soaring in the city of 1.5 million.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has invited the Maoists to resume talks which broke down in August 2003 over rebel demands for a convention to draft a new constitution.
Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known as ""Prachanda,"" or ""The Fierce,"" said Friday the rebels would only negotiate if they were certain the talks would not be scuttled by King Gyanendra, whom he blamed for the failure of two previous peace bids.

"7704",2011468,"Title: Duty-free quota-free market access to LDCs.rtf; Date: July 19, 2011 Tuesday; Text: Against the popular notion about the benefits from the ongoing Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO), an argument can be put forward that it has little to do with the income and welfare gains of the least developed countries (LDCs). And, the possibility of grabbing opportunities from the successful conclusion of this trade deal looks even overstated for a country like Nepal. The logic behind this argument has two aspects, as I have explained in this daily recently (See ""WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations: Relevance for Nepal? (THT, July 1, Page 8). As elaborated, the LDCs have rarely anything to gain, directly and immediately, from the market access commitments made in the agriculture and non-agriculture trade of the negotiations, because most of them are less dependent on farm trade, and they are already privileged by the preferential treatment for a bulk of their manufacturing goods in several rich country markets. Furthermore, they are likely to lose their preference margins as the tariffs for both agriculture and non-agriculture products are likely to shrink as per the negotiation.Thus, if the Doha Round matters to LDCs, it's only the duty-free, quota-free market access programme included in the deal.
The LDCs' hope over the successful Doha Round hinges largely on meaningful duty- free, quota-free market access, which has been evolved as a genuine and ambitious programme aimed at the poor countries' well-being.
This is probably the first time that the rich countries have shown their generosity to poor countries, making bound commitments to preferential market access to LDC exports without any prejudice in the WTO system.
In the previous rounds of trade negotiations, poor countries had to take bound commitments in exchange for unbound commitments of the rich country supports. Sadly, rich countries had once again failed to live up to their promises, because the LDCs have been bamboozled by the exception made in the proposed duty-free, quota-free market access, which has a provision of excluding three per cent of the rich country tariff lines from the reduction commitment.
Although the three per cent exclusion provision looks minuscule, it is enough to dampen market access opportunities of the LDCs due to a very narrow export base of such countries. In most of the rich countries, the three per cent of tariff lines (at six digit HS code) cover more than 90 per cent of the LDC exports. For some LDCs, almost all of their export product category may fall under the three per cent tariff lines, or may cover a significant portion of their total export value under this limitation, in the rich country markets. A glaring example is Nepal's textiles and apparel exports, which are key export items without preferential access, to the United States, at the moment. These products strictly fall under 80 to 90 tariff lines (at eight digit HS code), which could be easily contained in the three per cent exclusion provision of the US tariff system, if it wanted.
The incidence of exclusion is even more acute in the case of Bangladesh, which depends excessively on textiles and apparel exports; and Benin, Burkino Faso, Chad and Mali on cotton; and Angola and Sudan on oil, to give some examples.
Hence, the three per cent exclusion is enough to neutralize the net benefit of the duty-free, quota- free market access, making it worthless to these LDCs. At the same time, the hundred per cent product coverage scheme could also remain futile - excepting the United States, where about half of the LDC exports are still subject to tariffs - in a number of major export destinations, where LDCs are already facilitated by the unilateral preferential schemes, such as the EU's 'Everything but Arms (EBA)', which are broader in scope. The LDCs tend to lose preferential margins under such schemes with reduction in multilateral tariff levels as sought in the Doha Round of negotiation. Thus, the validity of the duty-free, quota- free market access would largely depend upon whether the emerging and developing economies, such as India and China, are willing to grant such a privilege to LDCs mandatorily.
Developing country markets, particularly India, could be attractive to many LDCs due to its large market size and relatively higher applied tariffs with lower non-tariff barriers. However, as Nepal is already a beneficiary of the preferential treatment, arranged bilaterally with India, it will most likely face preference erosion in India, should the preference apply indiscriminately.
While the delay in Doha Round has already been reducing market access potentials for LDCs, with the international tariff levels moderating, as driven by globalization, the duty-free, quota-free market access programme is also losing its charm in the face of unilaterally proposed broader preferential schemes. So, to uphold the WTO's pet programme for LDCs, the rich countries should practice as they preach, without flaws any more.

The government of Orissa state was using motorized boats to rescue people, Chief Secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathi told reporters.
So far, 180,000 people have been evacuated to relief camps since heavy monsoon rains caused the Mahanadi river to overflow its banks, leaving 220,000 still marooned, he said.
Two Indian air force helicopters were dropping packets of food to villagers in the flooded villages where people were stranded, Tripathi said, adding that the state has requested three more helicopters from the national government.
The flooding has killed at least 16 people and affected huge swathes of 17 out of 30 districts in Orissa, he said.
The new flooding comes just a month after the monsoon-swollen Kosi river, a Ganges tributary that flows from Nepal to India, burst its banks and submerged nearly 1,000 villages in the impoverished northern Indian state of Bihar, killing at least 48 people and driving more than a million others from their homes.

Officiating Head of the NAC's Engineering Department Mukunda Prasad Joshi said the mouse that was found stuck by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited (HAECO)-the transit check and maintenance contractor that refuels and does minor maintenance of NAC planes in Hong Kong-staffers at 6:00 am local time escaped and disappeared at around 10:30 even as the pest control body was contacting the health department which would have checked the rodent for public health risks.
""We had even got clearance from the airport authority to fly to Kathmandu at 11:00 am local time and the crew was already on the way to the airport when it got the message that the mouse had escaped,"" NAC Station Manager in Hong Kong Gauri Lal Dangi said. Joshi, the NAC's engineering chief, said HAECA had used fog and traps to bring the mouse out on Thursday but to no avail.
""They will repeat the procedure again and use insecticides Thursday night,"" Joshi said. NAC Spokesperson Raju Bahadur KC stated that it would be very difficult to allow the plane to fly without capturing the mouse.
The NAC has cancelled the flight to Dubai and then to Doha scheduled for Thursday night after the mouse escaped. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

"2369",20043808,"Title: India needs to defuse ticking AIDS bomb, sex workers told.rtf; Date: February 25, 2004 Wednesday; Text: India must take swift action against HIV/AIDS by educating its population about the disease in order to prevent infection levels skyrocketing, Indian officials said at a conference Wednesday.
""Unless the problem is addressed on a war-footing in India, the killer disease could become as devastating as in Africa,"" West Bengal Health Minister Surya Kanta Mishra told the conference.
Speaking at an eight-day conference in West Bengal's Calcutta Mishra said: ""HIV and AIDS is not only a health problem, it has a far-reaching impact on the developing economy of India,
The conference has drawn more than 5,000 sex workers from various Indian states and delegates of sex workers' organisations from Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, New Zealand and Canada to look at ways of battling the disease.
An estimated 30,000 sex workers are expected to attend over the course of the week.
""AIDS threatens to become a crisis of alarming proportion in India, undermining public health development unless an urgent action plan is adopted to slow the spread of the disease,"" India's Health Secretary J.V.R. Prasad Rao told an international conference of sex workers.
An Indian government-funded project launched 12 years ago in Sonagachi, housing more than 8,000 sex workers, has successfully slowed the spread of HIV/AIDS, and can serve as an example for similar scheme nationwide, Rao said.
""We must send a message across the country that urgent action, based on the Sonagachi model, is needed to fight HIV and AIDS in India,"" he told the meeting.
The programme combines free distribution of condoms with an education campaign.
There are more than two million sex workers in India who are highly susceptible to the disease because of reluctance by Indian males to use condoms and ignorance about the disease, experts say.
India officially has around 4.58 million people living with HIV/AIDS, second only to South Africa's five million, and a recent study warned that the figure could skyrocket if urgent action is not taken.
According to the World Health Organisation, 95 percent of the 40 million people infected with the virus live in developing nations.
Some 30 million people have died of AIDS while around 14,000 are infected with HIV each day around the world.

"1429",2004233,"Title: Nepalese paper urges parties, government to address Maoist problem.rtf; Date: August 20, 2004, Friday; Text: Excerpt from editorial entitled: ""Blockade in the capital"", published by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 20 August
 It is unfortunate to see that the pro-parliament political parties have not been able to understand the reality - Maoists for the past nine years have been rebelling to establish a communist republic in place of the constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy - and adopt a common opinion to solve the problem.
 Due to the violent rebellion, the indifference and stagnation of the political parties, Nepal is on the brink of becoming a failed state, but the political parties are still busy with their own agendas and are unconcerned about national consensus, which is increasing the possibility for the situation to deteriorate further. The violent rebellion that had been limiting the presence of the government to the district headquarters has now finally entrapped the capital as well. This is a big challenge for the government; this is a clear sign that the country's capital has been surrounded by the rebels.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 20 Aug 04
The situation has deteriorated to such a degree that it is hard to believe in the government's presence and effectiveness even inside the capital. The multinational industrial enterprises that could not remain assured by the government's security assurances have closed down their businesses.  passage omitted: capital is under blockade, industries located in the strongholds of the security forces have been closed down; blockade has its roots in the minds of irresponsible political leaders
 Big parties like the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist) should initiate a process for national consensus to solve the problem. These two parties should call all small and big parties to a round-table conference and forge a national consensus. There is no possibility that the palace will disagree with the decision of the political parties. Whatever policy is adopted after reaching such consensus, a positive and lasting solution to the Maoist problem should be sought on the basis of the policy. No solution is expected from an individual party, group or their statements. If the pro-parliament political parties remain divided, continue to suspect each other and try to address the Maoist problem in an individualistic manner, then sooner or later they are certain to be ruined. So the pro-parliament forces need to hurry to unite against the anti-democratic forces.

"2906",20044370,"Title: Nepal says it will press ahead with elections despite rebel attacks.rtf; Date: March 23, 2004 Tuesday; Text: Nepal's home minister said Tuesday the government will press ahead with elections despite a deadly Maoist attack against security forces at the weekend he said was aimed at disrupting the polls.
The army said Sunday it killed over 500 rebels in the single bloodiest clash since the Maoists launched their revolt in 1996 to topple the monarchy and set up a communist republic in the Himalayan nation.
It was impossible to verify independently the number of dead due to the area's remoteness.
""Despite the Maoist attacks on Beni Bazar, the government will go ahead with plans for the general elections,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters after inspecting the battleground in rebel-dominated west Nepal.
The Maoist leader, known as Prachanda or the ""fierce one,"" has accused the government of being ""hell-bent on continuing military totalitarianism in the name of conducting the elections.""
The Maoists have vowed to continue their attacks until a ""political solution"" is reached to the revolt that has undermined the economy of the already impoverished nation by scaring away tourists and investment.
Thapa did not say when the polls would be held. Earlier, the government had said they would take place around November.
If the army's statement that over 500 rebels died in the most recent fighting is true, it would mark a big setback for the Maoists, who boasted last weekend that a ""decisive victory over the autocratic regime looms large on the horizon.""
But newspaper editorials said Tuesday it was far from clear the army had scored a decisive win over the rebels.
""The Maoists created havoc in the town,"" said the largest-selling English daily The Kathmandu Post.
The Maoists said on Monday only 49 of their fighters died in the battle in which authorities said around 2,500 rebels stormed a state bank, a jail and government buildings in Beni Bazar.
Thapa said government forces had so far recovered the bodies of 210 rebels. He said 28 security men and four civilians died in the clash.
Thapa also said 35 soldiers and security guards were missing. The Maoists said Monday, however, they held 92 hostages.
The government has said the latest attack has lessened chances of new peace talks with the Maoists, who walked out of negotiations last August after they became deadlocked.
Nepal has been rocked by months of student and opposition party protests against King Gyanendra's October 2002 dismissal of the elected government, saying it was incompetent to tackle the revolt by the Maoists that has claimed over 9,500 lives.

 Kathmandu, 3 July: Individuals and other organizations affiliated with the diplomatic missions here have become aware of being direct or indirect targets of possible ""extortion racket"" of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists). The attention of the diplomatic missions has been drawn to this possibility following a recent letter from the rebels demanding 100,000 rupees from Modern Indian School, which is being managed under the aegis of the Indian embassy in Kathmandu.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 4 Jul 03Similarly, other Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions have received information that Maoists have been extorting money from ex-British and Indian Gurkha soldiers residing in Maoist-dominated areas.
 ""The British Welfare Scheme is directly related to the issue but we have adopted a policy of not giving any donations to the Maoists,"" a high-level official at the British embassy in Kathmandu told The Kathmandu Post. According to sources, two officials from the Indian embassy, who met Maoists leaders Dr Baburam Bhattarai and Matrika Yadav some weeks ago, urged the Maoists not to maintain any links with violent Indian militant organizations.
 Although the Maoist duo is reported to have clarified that they had only ideological links with the Indian outfits, the embassy officials were not convinced, it is learnt. More than a week ago, a top PWG People's War Group leader said that they had links with Nepal's Maoists, as among other such organizations in Asia.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 4 May
Kathmandu, 4 May: Leaders of political parties on Wednesday [3 May] said that the government and the House should be alert and work to fulfil the people's demand of holding election to a constituent assembly and punishing the enemies of democracy. Speaking at the Reporters' Club here, NC [Nepali Congress] leader Ram Chandra Paudel said recent political developments have proved that Nepal's politics still lack a leader of statesmanlike stature.
""The House of Representatives should learn to accept a democratic culture. I have to admit, we are still carrying the old feudal tradition even in this new scenario,"" he said.
According to him, political leaders should not be moved by the demands of the masses. Rather, the leaders should be able to convey unpopular decisions, tell the bitter truth and educate them. He added that the NC has no problem joining the cabinet as all the leaders accepted what party president GP Koirala recommended.
Dr Minendra Rijal of NC-D said that the political parties are going through tough times as they have to prove in front of the people that they are worthy of trust. He also said that the management of arms belonging to the Maoist could be a major problem, adding that: ""This was one of the points on which we differed in our 12-point understanding with the Maoists.""
""The government should also show some flexibility while inviting or holding talks with the Maoists,"" he said, adding that the reinstated House of Representatives has the mandate to go for a constituent assembly and work in cooperation with the Maoists. Rijal added that till date, the House has been a prerogative of a certain caste and it was time to determine that it belong equally to all ethnic groups and backward communities, as well as people from remote geographic regions.
UML leader Pradip Gaywali said there was a gap in the activities of the House and level of people's. He stressed the need to work at a pace which the people desire. ""The House should respect the demands of the people,"" he said, adding that the parties had been successful in the movement but failed to manage its results.
He admitted that a UML [Unified Marxist-Leninist] control committee meeting witnessed a problem regarding participation in the government. ""UML demanded fair and just participation in the government. It was not only a matter of sharing,"" he said.
According to him, UML had demanded the home and defence ministries as it wanted to form a commission to punish enemies of democracy and wanted to ensure that the mistakes of the Mallik Commission were not repeated. ""We also wanted to ensure the streamlining of the army by confining its mobility and authority,"" he said. Lilamani Pokharel of the United Peoples' Front said the people's awareness of politics was a step ahead of that of the political leaders.

The suspects, detained last week, were members of the Communist Party of Bhutan (Maoist-Leninist) a group that was blamed for a Feb. 4 explosion in Bhutan's southwest and four other blasts across the country in January, said police official Kipchu Namgyel.
No casualties were reported in the February bombing. One person was wounded in the January explosions.
The Communist Party of Bhutan (Maoist-Leninist) could not be reached for comment on the detentions.
The extremely rare violence in the Buddhist kingdom was believed to be linked to March elections that will introduce democracy to the longtime absolute monarchy of Bhutan, Namgyel said. The king will remain enthroned as a figurehead after the vote for a parliament.
""The Maoists seem to be trying to disrupt the March 24 parliamentary elections in Bhutan, but we are on strict vigil and not taking chances,"" Namgyel said by telephone from the capital, Thimphu.
Unrest in the country dates back to the early 1990s when more than 100,000 ethnic Nepalis, a predominantly Hindu minority in Bhutan, fled or were forced to leave by authorities who wanted to impose Buddhist culture nationwide.
The rebels have said the elections will not be fair because ethnic Nepalis from Bhutan have been excluded from the process.
Bhutan has refused to take the refugees back. It said most left voluntarily, an argument the Nepalis hotly dispute. Several communist rebel groups have risen among the refugees in their camps in nearby eastern Nepal, where most of them now live.
Bhutanese authorities captured the communist suspects last week during raids on ethnic Nepalese refugee camps in southern Bhutan near the Indian border.
The blasts have triggered concern across the usually peaceful country.
""If we look at the history of war-torn regions in the world, many began with a single blast,"" Bhutan's state-controlled newspaper Kuensel said in a Feb. 16 editorial. ""We do not need to lose lives before we start worrying.""

 New Delhi, April 22 -- Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma has said that India is ready to provide all possible assistance to Nepal to ensure that it achieves political and economic stability at the earliest.
  In a statement issued soon after King Gyanendra's announcement of handing over power back to the seven-party political alliance, Sharma said that the people of Nepal have ""undergone acute suffering and economic hardship during the last several months, but have always kept their faith with democracy and freedom. They deserve our respect and admiration.""
  ""We sincerely hope that the aspirations of the people of Nepal can now be addressed by enabling them to enjoy their rights through a democratic electoral exercise free from the threat of violence,"" the Minister added. 
  He further went on to say that the King's reaffirmation for multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy, should now pave the way for the restoration of political stability and economic recovery of the kingdom.
  In a separate development relating to India's foreign policy initiatives with Africa, the Ministry of External Affairs has announced that Sharma will lead an official delegation to Windhoek, Namibia from April 26-28, 2006 to participate in the Consultative Conference of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and to attend the India-SADC Forum meeting. A spokesman of the Ministry said that the visit is in response to an invitation from the Executive Secretary of the SADC. 
  During his visit, Sharma is also expected to call on the Namibian dignitaries, including Their Excellencies the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Minister of Education of Namibia, among others. Separately, the Minister will meet his counterparts from the SADC Member States on the sidelines of the Conference. 
  SADC constitutes one of the most important regional organizations in Africa and its 14 member countries are Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Madagascar. 
  India attaches utmost importance to further strengthening its relationship and ties with SADC in different sectors. SADC believes that the Indian success in tackling the problems of development through democracy is a paradigm of considerable importance and interest to its members. 
  India's commercial and economic links with SADC member countries have registered a marked improvement in recent years with trade more than doubling from 1.5 billion dollars in 1997 to over four billion dollars in 2004-2005. It is essential to keep up this pace of growth and to deepen our links in the economic and other arenas. 
  In order to further strengthen the already close ties between India and SADC member states, the India-SADC Forum meeting will identify the following areas for special focus: 
  - Food, agriculture and natural resources
 - Water resources management
 - Trade, industry, finance and investment
 - Small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurial development
 - Human resources development
 - Drugs and pharmaceuticals
 - Information and Communications Technology

 It has come to light that Maoists deployed 800 militia from far western to eastern Nepal while talks were going on between the government and the rebels. The rebel militia were moved to the districts of Tehrathum, Panchthar, Taplejung and Sankhuwasabha in April this year via Dharan, Dhankuta and Hile.
 A member of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) told Spacetime that battalions and companies were deployed in eastern Nepal to reinforce the PLA strength there. They travelled in eight reserved buses from Holeri in Dang in the midwest in the third week of April.
Spacetime, Kathmandu, in Nepali 29 Oct 03 p1
The Royal Nepal Army barracks at Salleri in Dhankuta intercepted them and found only photographs of them with weapons. They even beat up Jas Bahadur Bista, alias Sandesh, company commander of the 18th Battalion ""A"" Company.
 The army released them when no weapons were found. They dispersed to districts in the region.
 Most were veterans of rebel attacks on Mangalsen, Dang, Jumla, Argakanchi and other places, they told Spacetime. They revealed this during a sudden and unplanned encounter with Spacetime at Heydangn Gadi, about two days' walk from the district headquarters of Sankhuwasabha Khadbari . Most are from far western Nepal, including women.
 Security sources at district headquarters said the government has received official confirmation of the movement. They did not confirm how many rebels had entered eastern Nepal.
 A rebel admitted they were having difficulty assimilating with the locals in the east. ""Difficulties have emerged for our local comrades because of the language difference.""
 Company commander Suresh once ordered his troops to ""Drop your plates"" during a meal on a tour of the northern district to strengthen the organization in Sankhuwasabh. The militia immediately obeyed and dropped their plates. The order meant completely the opposite in the local dialect in eastern Nepal. Many rebels went hungry that day.  passage omitted
 Indra Bahadur Rai, alias Sankat, chief of the People's Government of Pathibhara, said the rebels from far western Nepal have not assimilated with locals in the east. ""They said we (easterners) are not ready to die. It will take more than a hundred lives before the party is established here,"" said a surprised Rai.

"1059",20031686,"Title: Hillary pauses to celebrate Everest conquest, then goes back to fund-raising.rtf; Date: May 6, 2003, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: Fifty years after conquering Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary is still setting himself lofty goals.
As he prepares to travel to Nepal to mark the anniversary of his momentous climb to the summit of the world's highest peak, Hillary is planning to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help impoverished people living in the Himalayan mountains.
These days, it is those aspirations rather than memories of his historic climb that invigorate the 83-year-old former beekeeper.
""Building schools and hospitals, medical clinics and fresh water pipelines and re-establishing forestry"" were ""the most worthwhile things we have done"" over the past several decades, Hillary said in an interview with The Associated Press.
""I've had a remarkable time, I've had great adventures, I've made extremely good friends … and of course we've been able to be extremely helpful to the Sherpas"" he said, summing up the 50 years since May 29, 1953.
On that day, the 33-year-old New Zealander and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first climbers to reach the 29,035 foot summit of Mt. Everest.
Today, the last obstacle before the domed summit, a 40-foot ice-covered rock face, is called the ""Hillary Step"" in recognition of the triumph.
More than 1,200 people since then have climbed to the peak, and the trail blazed by Hillary and Tenzing is well worn. Officials say at least 180 have died in the process.
This year, a record 1,000 climbers plan assaults on the summit of what the Nepalese call Chomolungma or Mother Goddess of the World. Most will fail to reach the top.
Meanwhile, Hillary and the charitable trust he set up funnels about $400,000 annually into development projects in the Solu Khumbu region of Nepal.
Hillary's trust has built two hospitals, a dozen health clinics, 27 schools, air landing strips, bridges and even restored Buddhist monasteries for the Sherpa people he vowed to aid back in 1953 in return for Tenzing's help in getting him to the roof of the world.
Hillary is looking forward to a ""lively old time at a huge party"" on the 50th anniversary in the Nepalese capital of Katmandu he told the AP from his Auckland home.
At least 100 family and western mountaineering friends and up to 600 Nepalese will attend the May 29 celebratory dinner.
""Time has slipped by but getting all my friends together, both Sherpas and Westerners, will be great fun. There is no question about that,"" he said.
Part of the celebrations will be broadcast live by television back to New Zealand, where Hillary is a national hero.
Within days he will fly to events in London, New York, Washington and San Francisco to raise half a million U.S. dollars for the Himalayan Trust he founded.
Recalling his climb last year, Hillary said he vividly remembers ""many occasions"" when he and Tenzing doubted they would reach the top. Deep ravines and crevasses, avalanches, extreme ice faces and rock walls stood in the way as they struggled upward.
""That's what it's all about really, overcoming those problems even though you may have a sense of fear. I think fear can be a stimulating factor and can help make you drive yourself really to overcome dangerous problems,"" he said.
Everest is not the only challenge he has conquered.
He also has led expeditions to both the North and South Poles and a jet boat adventure up India's River Ganges to its mountain source.
Approaching his 84th birthday in July, Hillary acknowledged, ""I've got to slow down"" and reduce his international fund-raising commitments, but he added: ""how I'm going to do that I don't quite know.""

 Text of press release by Paris-based organization Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) on 14 September
 Reporters Without Borders has protested at the Nepalese security forces actions since the start of the month during which they have beaten and arrested at least 55 journalists who were reporting on or joining pro-democracy demonstrations.
 ""Journalists covering marches opposing King Gyanendra are facing the same levels of brutality as those taking part,"" it said. ""Since the Maoists declared a cease-fire on 3 September, the crackdown has been stepped up to break the advance of the democratic parties. We call for an end to police brutality and for the right to demonstrate peacefully.""
Reporters Sans Frontieres press release, Paris, in English 14 Sep 05
Police on 5 September clubbed a score of journalists covering a demonstration in Kathmandu that called for ""an end to the dictatorship"". One of them, Satyaram Parajuli, was seriously injured. Most of the Nepalese media have spoken out against this violence, that worsened still further the next day at a new opposition rally.
 On that day, 6 September, a score of journalists were beaten up, including Bharat Shahi, editor of the weekly Chuli Sandesh, Bhimsen Rajbahak of the broadcast agency Communication Corner, Kamal Pariyar of the weekly Jana Sangharsa, Rodan Rai, photographer for the Himalayan Times and Gyanendra Sharma, cameraman for Nepal One TV. Bharat Shahi was beaten about the head by both uniform and plain-clothes police and was rushed to hospital with very serious injuries. Several witnesses reported that an officer - Ganesh KC - gave the order to arrest journalists covering the demonstrations.
 Three days later, on 9 September, police arrested at least 34 writers and journalists who were shouting slogans in support of greater freedom of expression in Bhotahiti, in central Kathmandu. They were held for six hours at Mahendra police station before being released.
 Finally, on 13 September, more than 500 demonstrators, including several journalists, were again manhandled and arrested by police in the capital. At least five of the journalists, including Tilak Mahat, a reporter for the regional daily Lumbini Dainik and Suresh Sainju, were severely clubbed.
 This wave of arrests comes after the arrest on 20 July of Nagendra Upadhyaya, managing editor of the weekly New Malika, based in Teekapur in Kailali district in the far west of Nepal and reporter for the daily Abhiyan in Mahendranagar, in the same region. The journalist was placed in custody under the anti-terror law, TADO. He was accused by the local administration of helping Maoist militants. A colleague told Reporters Without Borders that the authorities had not produced any proof.
 The organization pointed out that journalists Maheshwor Pahari of the local weekly Rastriya Swabhiman and Tejnarayan Sapkota of the weekly Yojana are both still being held in jail.

Minister Madhukar Shumshere J.B. Rana told the ADB annual meeting in Istanbul that his government would carry out reforms ""towards making the economy market driven by providing full political space for the private sector.""
Speaking to finance officials from the 62 other ADB member nations, Rana said that ""in three years, we will find Nepal a peaceful, multi-party constitutional democracy.""
He said the Nepalese government was ""fully and sincerely committed to implementing the aid agreements in their letter and spirit,"" despite King Gyanedra's takeover.
Faced with a bloody, nine-year Maoist rebellion, the monarch declared a state of emergency, suspended most civil liberties and jailed thousands of political opponents and activists.
Although he recently lifted the state of emergency, the king still rules without an elected government and hundreds of dissidents remain in prison.
Rana defended the king's actions, saying they were needed to fight terrorism and to avoid worsening civil strife.
He also called on aid donors to provide humanitarian assistance to as many as 600,000 people displaced by the insurgency.
Despite the conflict, he stressed, Nepal has been able to lower the level of poverty and maintain macroeconomic stability.
Officials earlier said that the ADB, a multilateral aid agency, has not released any new loans or grants to Nepal since the king's takeover, but is  maintaining the projects that have already been launched there.

""As the forthcoming peace talks with the Maoists will be mainly focussed on the major political issues, I appeal to all the party leaders in the disbanded parliament to come and discuss the political issues to be presented during the talks,"" Thapa told state-run television.
The official peace talks team aims to fix the date for the third round of peace talks with the Maoists as early as possible.
The party leaders from the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) and the Nepali Congress (NC) rejected the call to join peace talks outright Monday, and vowed to continue their struggle against the government.
""There is no point in joining the government's peace team on the appeal of prime minister Thapa as we are have been demanding his removal to form an all-party government,"" an NCP-UML source said.
""We also want the king to reinstate the dissolved house of representatives,"" the source said.
King Gyanendra on October 4 dissolved parliament, and dismissed an elected prime minister, replacing him with a royalist prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
The king then took the executive powers of the prime minister.
The agitating political parties have stepped up pressure on the king to reappoint the elected prime minister and return power to parliament.
Meanwhile, a Maoist source said two Maoist negotiators Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa are arriving in Kathmandu in the next 48 hours to hold talks with different party leaders concerning the proposed third round of negotiations.
""Only after fixing the date for the third round of peace talks, the leader and the convenor of the Maoist peace talks team Babu Ram Bhattarai will be arriving with other two members,"" the Maoist source said.
The Maoists would open a public relations office in Kathmandu to improve communication with the local populace after a date is set for peace talks to begin, he added.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed over 7,800 lives.
The two sides announced a truce in January this year and have so far held two rounds of talks but without any results.

Nepal also asked the Indian prime minister not to resume arms supply to Nepal till the restoration of democracy, Bhattarai said.
 Singh is learnt to have lamented that the constitutional forces could not come together to find peaceful solution to the crisis in Nepal.
 The UML delegation is to meet UPA [United Progressive Alliance] Chairperson Sonia Gandhi on 30 October. Bhattarai said the Nepal Democracy Solidarity Committee headed by CPI (M) [Communist Party of India (Marxist)] leader Harkisan Surjit has invited alliance leaders to visit India during the winter session of the parliament.

"7440",2011417,"Title: ETA announces permanent ceasefire.rtf; Date: January 10, 2011 Monday; Text: ADRID, Jan. 10 -- Armed Basque separatists ETA announced Monday a permanent, verifiable ceasefire after more than 40 years of bloodshed in their battle for a homeland independent of Spain.
""ETA has decided to declare a permanent and general ceasefire which will be verifiable by the international community,"" it said in text, voice and video statements distributed to media in Basque, Spanish and English.
""This is ETA's firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and towards an end to the armed confrontation.""
A video showed three ETA members in white hoods and black berets, sitting in front of a table and reading the statement out in the Basque and Spanish languages.
Behind them on the wall hung the ETA symbol of a snake wrapped around an axe, which represents armed struggle.
It is the first time that ETA has unilaterally declared a permanent ceasefire in its campaign of bombings and shootings, which has claimed the lives of 829 people in more than 40 years.
There was no immediate reaction from the government. Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, who is also interior minister, called an early-afternoon news conference.
ETA had also announced what it described as a permanent ceasefire in March 2006 within the framework of negotiations with Madrid.
But in December 2006, ETA fighters set off a bomb in the carpark of Madrid-Barajas airport, killing two men. Six months later it formally called off the ceasefire.
""It is time to act with historic responsibility. ETA calls upon those governing Spain and France to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the Basque Country,"" the latest statement said.
""ETA will continue its indefatigable struggle and efforts to promote and to bring to a conclusion the democratic process until there is a truly democratic situation in the Basque Country.""
ETA released a series of declarations in September last year proposing an end to violence and calling for international mediation.
But the Spanish government dismissed them, insisting on a definitive, verifiable ceasefire.
Spanish authorities believe ETA has been severely weakened after its security forces in cooperation with other countries, particularly France, repeatedly decapitated the group in raids on the leadership.
But ETA has also come under severe pressure from within.
The group's political wing, Batasuna was ruled illegal in 2003 due to its links with ETA.
And it has called on ETA to declare a permanent, verifiable ceasefire in an effort to get the ban on its activities lifted so it can take part in municipal elections in May this year.
ETA was formed on July 31, 1959 during the dictatorship of general Francisco Franco by a group of Basque nationalist students.
On June 7, 1968, ETA shot and killed the police chief of the Basque coastal city of San Sebastian in the first deadly attack for which it claimed responsibility.
The Spanish government however has dated the first attack to June 27, 1960, when an incendiary bomb exploded in a station in San Sebastian and killed a baby.
ETA assassinated Franco's prime minister and presumed successor Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco on December 20, 1973. He was killed instantly when his car drove over explosives planted by ETA in Madrid, sending the vehicle high into the air. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

Troops combed the jungles in the Rolpa district, 350 kilometers (215 miles) west of Kathmandu as part of an offensive begun last week, the senior officer, who declined to be named, told AFP by telephone.
Last week, 22 rebels and three soldiers were killed in the area which followed army claims earlier this month that at least 150 rebels were killed in an assault on an army base in an adjoining district.
""Over 1,400 army security forces are being mobilized in Rolpa and are narrowing the circle on the Maoists in the course of the offensive operation of the army in western Nepal,"" the senior officer said.
The army said it did not know how many rebels were in the jungle areas of Rolpa.
The stepped up campaign by the army comes almost three months after King Gyanendra sacked the government and assumed absolute power to crush a Maoist rebellion which has left more than 11,000 people dead since 1996.
On Monday, newspapers in Kathmandu said that the rebels controlled vast swathes of the countryside outside the capital Kathmandu including a district headquarters in Rolpa that collected taxes and enforced laws.
The army disputed the newspaper reports.
""There is no such thing as a Maoist stronghold area or their headquarters anywhere in the country as the security forces are able to get anywhere within the kingdom,"" Royal Nepal Army Mid-west Division Major General Dipak Bikram Rana said Monday.
""There is nothing that shows they have their so-called headquarters or office,"" he said.

Protesters burned tyres and torched at least three motorcycles at the close of the two-day strike, which opposition parties called even though the pro-royal prime minister last week met their demands to resign.
In the countryside, a Maoist insurgency surged on with 34 people killed in fierce fighting over two days, according to police.
Traffic was off the streets of Kathmandu and shops were closed, with supporters of the opposition, which is not affiliated with the Maoists, putting locks on the doors of 32 municipal offices to enforce the strike, witnesses said.
Angry youth smeared soot on the face of one municipal ward chief who showed up for work, Haribol Nakarmi, who was ushered away to safety by riot police, opposition activist Bhairav Rawal said.
After scattered rallies in the morning, some 20,000 protesters converged near the royal palace where they held banners of leftist parties and shouted slogans demanding the king to restore democracy.
Speakers pledged the often fractious opposition would put up a united front in negotiations with the palace to name the replacement for Surya Bahadur Thapa, the king's handpicked premier who quit Friday after more than a month of street protests.
""Whatever efforts the regressive forces may try, the unity among the five opposition parties will not break,"" Sushil Koirala, general secretary of the Nepali Congress party, told the rally near Narayanhiti Palace.
The main opposition leaders have refused to deal individually with the king, demanding he negotiate with all the parties' chiefs at once.
The king, however, met Tuesday with Sher Bahadur Deuba, the prime minister he fired in 2002 when he suspended elected rule.
Deuba said he asked for his former job back but also urged the king to negotiate with the parties spearheading the protests.
The king dismissed Deuba arguing that elected leaders were ""incompetent"" at solving Nepal's myriad problems, particularly a Maoist insurgency which has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.

"983",20031247,"Title: British begin rapid buildup in advance of possible war in Iraq(2).rtf; Date: February 28, 2003 Friday; Text: A month ago, the British area of Camp Fox was nothing but a pristine patch of golden sand in the Kuwaiti desert. By Friday, it had become a bustling base filled with tents, flatbed trucks and newly arrived shipping containers filled with supplies destined for British fighters.
Unlike their American counterparts, many of whom have been here for months, British troops only began arriving in Kuwait a few weeks ago and have had to work furiously to get themselves ready for a possible war in Iraq.
Most of the 18,000 to 20,000 British troops here arrived in the past two weeks. At least 6,000 more are expected in the coming days.
""If you compare us as a force to the last Gulf War, then we've moved twice as much in half the time,"" said Lt. Col. Debbie Noble, a British military spokeswoman. ""There's more of a sense of urgency with this one because we have come in late in the day.""
U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have threatened to invade Iraq if Saddam does not fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors trying to verify Iraq's claims it has no banned weapons.
Both leaders have said time is running out for Saddam Hussein and have sponsored a U.N. resolution that would give U.N. sanction to military action against Iraq.
A quarter of the British army and its biggest naval task force in 20 years is building up in the region. The Royal Air Force also has ordered 100 planes and 27 helicopters.
Because the British arrived so rapidly, they were forced to rely on U.S. troops already here for help.
The British soldiers at Camp Fox ate U.S. military rations when they first arrived.
U.S. Marines staying at another area of the camp helped them with security, gave them hot showers and extra supplies when they needed them.
""They've got the infrastructure in place and we've been able to blister on to it,"" Noble said. ""We came in so late in the day that we had no choice.""
British and U.S. Marines have begun running drills together in the desert to familiarize themselves with each others' weapons and vehicles. British Marines also planned to practice running into and out of U.S. helicopters, just in case they need a lift during a battle.
""This will give us the opportunity to work with each other,"" said Capt. Jay Delarosa, a U.S. Marine spokesman.
The British base at Camp Fox is responsible for supplying nearly all the arriving British troops.
Using electronic scanners, members of the 6th Supply Regiment Royal Logistics Corp., whose motto is ""Supply or Die,"" log in tons of supplies arriving in huge shipping containers, everything from replacement tank engines to medical supplies.
""You can't just move a whole force and drop them on the ground and expect them to be ready to fight,"" said Lt. Dave Barlow, 24, of Birmingham.
In one part of the camp, engineers used flatbed trucks and machinery to lift shipping containers in a storage area that could eventually hold 10,000 tons of ammunition.
In another area, Nepalese Gurkha engineers carved the pieces for a prefabricated outhouse out of wood.
The vast desert field beyond the camp will soon be covered with hundreds of shipping containers acting as storage closets for British supplies that can be rapidly moved to soldiers at the front.
""It does seem like we're playing catch up,"" said Maj. Chris Davis, the camp commandant. ""(But) we're now reaching the stage where we've probably come up to readiness.""

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 9 June
Surkhet [district in mid-western Nepal]: A cease-fire has taken place for the third time between the government and the Maoists and there are signs of a return to peace, but those displaced by the conflict have not been able to return home. They have no hope of returning home until the Maoist conflict is completely resolved. According to the Human Rights Yearbook 2005 of the Informal Sector Service Centre (Insec), 22,000 people in the mid-western region of the country alone have been deprived of their homes. Of them, some 4,500 are living in Surkhet.
Maoists gave Bishnu Devi Thapa of Surkhet Guthu VDC  4 the figure of 50,000 rupees as the amount she was to pay in donation after her only offspring joined the armed police. As she could not pay the amount the Maoists did not allow her to remain in the village. ""Once they started saying that I had to either carry the gun or leave home, I came here,"" said 50-year-old Bishnu Devi with moist eyes.
Laxmi Kant Sanyal of Tatopani VDC paid up 50,000 rupees, but his situation is no different from that of Bishnu Devi. Sanyal, a technical assistant at the VDC office, moved to district headquarters Birendranagar five years ago when the VDC office also shifted there. But the Maoists abducted him and beat him up, accusing him of living at district headquarters although he is a technical assistant at village level. He was then released on condition that he would contribute 84,000 rupees, or two years' salary. As he could not pay the full amount, Sanyal has not been able to go home, for the past three years.
[Passage omitted]
Nobody has come forward to help and extend sympathy to those who were driven from their homes and are now living elsewhere in all manner of hardship. The government and some NGOs come and distribute relief material once in a while. But this is no consolation for those who have had to abandon the homesteads where they were born and grew up.
Whatever displaced individuals may no longer be able to do or have [examples omitted] they wish for an atmosphere to be created in which they themselves are able to open the padlocks placed on their doors.

The ban is expected to be lifted on July 1 and the labor department said it could readily deploy 1,500 workers on that day, the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment said.
There were mounting orders for Filipino workers for Iraq but because of the existing ban, some of the firms had opted to transfer their orders to Nepal and India, Philippine acting Labor Secretary Manuel Imson said in a statement.
""We should not miss out this opportunity, but at the same time, the safety and protection of our workers shall be our paramount consideration in any decision with regard to their deployment to Iraq,"" Imson said.
On Tuesday, Imson said the deployment of land-based workers is projected to grow this year in view of the increasing employment prospects for skilled workers and professionals in several countries that include new markets for overseas Filipino workers ( OFWs).  
Citing a report from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), Imson said the deployment of land-based OFWs is expected to grow by 6 to 9 percent this year. This translates to about 42,794 to 60,725 additional jobs in actual terms.
Data from POEA, an attached agency of the Department of Labor and Employment, show that OFW deployment in 2003 totaled 867,969.
In view of potential new jobs for OFWs, deployment this year may range from 910,763 to 926,694, excluding the sea-based sector, Imson said, noting the sea-based sector is also projected to grow, thereby, making the one million overseas jobs target for OFWs attainable this year.

Strike leader Gunraj Lohani said the teachers have demanded better working conditions in both public and private schools and improved benefits. They also want to ""stop the commercialization of the education sector,"" he said.
Lohani said Sunday's strike was called to protest the alleged beating of teachers who were demonstrating peacefully in front of the Education Ministry on Friday. He accused police of using bamboo batons to disperse demonstrators and firing tear gas. At least 70 people were injured, he said.
The teachers have shut down schools across this Himalayan nation for the past 11 days, and millions of students have been forced to stay at home.
The police headquarters in Katmandu said there was no reports of violence Sunday. No comment was given on the teachers' allegations of excessive force.

Lt. Gen. Loyd Utterback, the U.S. 13th Air Force commander, told his counterparts from 19 countries at a conference in Malaysia that they should understand each other's capabilities and learn how to swiftly deliver humanitarian assistance.
""It's our responsibility and it's our calling ... to be able to understand what each of us can bring to that next disaster that will come, hopefully later rather than sooner, here in the region,"" Utterback said while opening the forum on multilateral cooperation.
Utterback, who commands the military's air capabilities in the U.S. Pacific Command area, warned there was a ""tremendous potential for disasters that can occur in this region.""
""We must be prepared to take this on,"" Utterback said.
He highlighted Cyclone Nargis, which struck Myanmar in May, saying the junta's delay in allowing humanitarian aid contributed to the impact of the storm that killed at least 84,537 people. Another 53,836 are missing and presumed dead.
""The tragedy with Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar was something that could have been avoided. Not the fact that the weather and the floods came but the fact assistance and a helping hand did not come in a timely manner,"" he said.
Malaysian Royal Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Rodzali Daud also pressed for cooperation, saying ""not a single country can single-handedly face the major disasters on its own.""
Countries ""need to be better prepared, especially in identifying potential disaster areas and stocking up the necessary relief equipment, food, water and medical necessities,"" Rodzali said.
Officials at the forum should discuss the possibility of sharing a database and establishing a joint command structure to manage the distribution of aid, he said.
""In case of disaster, we need to respond quickly without being hindered by bureaucratic intricacies,"" Rodzali said.
Other officials participating in the forum came from Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

"144",2003290,"Title: ART REVIEW Millenniums of Asia, Packed Into a Week.rtf; Date: March 28, 2003 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
One Tuesday earlier this month, some of the Metropolitan Museum's Asian art galleries had an unusual number of visitors. That day more than 300 people went to the Ancient Near Eastern galleries, and most of them did the same thing when they got there. They took out a sketchbook and pencil and silently began to make drawings of the objects around them.
     An art class field trip? No, this was a draw-in organized by a New York-based group called Artists Against the War. The galleries they chose were those with work from ancient Mesopotamia, the land that is now Iraq. 
 Their purpose, they said, was to call attention to the civilizations that had flourished there under various names -- Sumer, Babylonia, Assyria, the Arab-Muslim Abbasid empire -- during 5,000 years, and into the present.
The objects the visitors drew included exquisite luxury items and fierce religious emblems, the latter often designed not to embody evil but to frighten it away. In certain pieces, influences from Arabia, Persia, China, India and the Mediterranean world mingled.
Whatever the specific political message of the event, by copying these Asian images over and over again, the artists seemed intent on emblazoning them on the collective consciousness of another culture, our own.
This week thousands of Asian objects have landed in Manhattan as part of the annual spring Asia Week. The International Asian Art Fair opens today; exhibitions are on at museums; dozens of galleries have cooked up special shows. (Shows of classical Chinese furniture, Antiques column, Page 44.) And the war that was threatening in early March is in progress. Inevitably, this political reality inflects the mood of the week itself, which is, after all, a market-dependent affair.
At the same time, as the collections at the Met suggest, it is a prism through which art itself can be viewed with fresh eyes, as a powerful but fragile carrier of social and spiritual information, aspirations and fears.
Art Fairs
The International Asian Art Fair is back at the Seventh Regiment Armory after last year's post-9/11 adventure in a tent in a West Side park. The show's 2003 edition -- its seventh -- looks very much at home again, but also different, at once denser and thinner.
The number of galleries participating has grown, to 55 from last year's 49. But the spectacular, big-ticket objects that used to give this fair a distinctive grandeur are few and far between. Although there is plenty of everything, most of that plenty seems smaller. This may be a reflection of political and economic jitters, or the diminishing availability of material, or the fact that certain charismatic galleries that have dropped out of the fair over time have been replaced by less distinguished newcomers. Whatever, that's where we are.
That said, where we are is still at the top of the art fair heap in New York. I judge this by applying two criteria: one, does a fair offer objects the likes of which you have never seen before, and, two, does it have art of a kind you passionately love but almost never see available elsewhere? The answer has always been yes and yes for the Asian Art Fair and still is.
One item that I would place in the first category is an 11th-century stone finial from a stupa, or Buddhist reliquary monument, at John Eskenazi's booth, with carved figures ranged in tiers from top to bottom on all four sides. That it survived intact, considering the height from which it presumably descended, is miraclous.
Another is the sandstone base for what must have been an immense carved Dharmachakra, or Wheel of the Buddhist Law, seen at the booth shared by Doris and Nancy Wiener. This majestic sculpture with its sinuous patterns symbolizing the core ingredients of the religion itself -- the Buddha, the Dharma and the monastic community, or Sangha -- probably dates from the first century B.C. or A.D. Although such objects are often depicted in relief carvings, I have never seen one of this size ""live.""
And as for passionately loved things too seldom encountered, the London dealer Sam Fogg has this year again brought a significant cache of non-Indian Islamic art. It includes examples of calligraphy in the form of Koran pages from ninth- and 10th-century Iraq. No text in the world is more hypnotic when spoken aloud than the Koran, and none more beautiful when written out by hand. In addition, Mr. Fogg has a display of early bowls with calligraphic inscriptions: ""he is he"" (meaning ""God is God""), says one; ""greed is a sign of poverty,"" says another; ""good food,"" says a third.
Finally, among this year's newcomers, M. Sutherland Fine Arts from New York is showing contemporary Asian painting, treading a path forged at the fair by Michael Goedhuis, who has up-to-date material at his booth and at his gallery on East 76th Street, and by China 2000, which has both 20th-century traditional painting by Shao Yixuan(1886-1954) and fascinating political work from the revolutio"

"6186",20073625,"Title: Cincinnati Zoo Inseminates Indian Rhino(2).rtf; Date: July 23, 2007 Monday 10:07 PM GMT; Text: The world's first Indian rhino baby to be conceived by artificial insemination is due during Christmas week at the Cincinnati Zoo. ""I think it's a remarkable achievement, an incredibly important success,"" said Dr. Evan Blumer, a board member of the International Rhino Foundation. ""The next step is where it becomes really important. The first is to be successful, the second is to be reliable and repeatable.""
Nikki, the mother, is 15 and has a life expectancy well into her 40s, so if all goes well, she could produce several more offspring.
Blumer is executive director of the Wilds, a private, nonprofit conservation reserve created on nearly 10,000 acres of reclaimed coal fields in southeast Ohio. He helped form a partnership with the Cincinnati Zoo, long known for its breeding program, where the first Sumatran rhino bred in captivity in more than a century gave birth in 2001.
Rhinos can be hard to breed naturally, Blumer said, because they can be aggressive and fight rather than mate. In fact, Nikki failed to get pregnant while at the Wilds but seemed like a good candidate for artificial insemination.
Semen was collected from Himal, a male Indian rhino at the Wilds, in November 2004 and was frozen. In August 2006, in their fourth attempt, the Cincinnati Zoo team succeeded in inseminating Nikki.
The gestation period for an Indian rhino is 16 months, so officials have waited anxiously to make the announcement Monday. Urine samples are collected several times a week to check hormone levels, and an ultrasound exam is conducted monthly.
""At this point, she's doing great,"" said Monica Stoops, who heads the rhino program at the zoo's Lindner Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife.
Zoo workers, who had to design and make the equipment to harvest sperm and then deposit it in Nikki's uterus, aren't saying whether ultrasound has shown the baby is male or female.
The Indian rhino is the second-largest of five living species, about three times the size of a Sumatran at up to 6,000 pounds, standing six feet tall and 12 feet long.
Stoops had to fashion a tube two meters long to reach Nikki's uterus, to deposit Himal's sperm that was recovered as in the domestic cattle industry, by electro-ejaculation using a two-foot-long, low-voltage device to shock the donor's genitals.
""This whole project required innovation, because you can't just go out and buy a (rhino) probe and have it work,"" Stoops. ""We had to develop a probe that was specifically designed for the rhino. It's got a special arc to it. It has taken a good bit of time to get that method down.""
In the 20th century, the Indian rhino native to northern India and southern Nepal was nearly wiped out. About 200 remained before tough preservation laws began to be stringently enforced, experts say.
Although their numbers have rebounded to about 2,500 in the wild, rhino poaching remains a serious problem. The single horn, which can reach 24 inches long, is sold on the black market for use in traditional Chinese medicines and as dagger handles.
The going rate is about $17,500 a pound, Stoops said.
""It's believed (by smugglers) to have aphrodisiac powers which, of course, it doesn't,"" Stoops said.
It's composed of the same material as a human fingernail, she said.
Although they're a popular zoo attraction, rhinos often are misunderstood, Stoops said.
""Rhinos are the coolest animals out there. Most people miss that point,"" she said. ""They're kind of seen as cantankerous and grumpy animals, but they're really not. They're animals that you can work with and make a big difference with.""

Girija Prasad Koirala took the oath in front of King Gyanendra before legislators met to act on demands from hundreds of thousands of protesters to end the monarch's sweeping powers.
The two political foes stood face-to-face during the short ceremony at the pink-hued Narayanhiti Royal Palace as veteran democracy campaigner Koirala, 84, read out the oath.
He now faces the task of keeping together an unwieldy seven-party coalition and persuading the Maoists to end their decade-long rebellion that has left more than 12,500 dead.
Koirala told the newly convened House of Representatives he wants the rebels to improve upon last week's declaration of a three-month ceasefire.
""Maoists have already declared a ceasefire. I request them to renounce violence and come to the process of dialogue,"" he said to applause from legislators.
He did not make a direct reference to the rebels' key demand, for a body to draw up a new constitution which would limit Gyanendra's powers.
But Koirala said he would stay committed to an agreement signed between the Maoists and the opposition alliance that includes a review of the king's powers.
Parliament sat Friday for the first time in four years but Koirala missed it, along with his planned swearing-in ceremony that day, because of bronchitis. He says he is well enough to lead the country.
Koirala, who has been premier several times before, appeared frail but stood to read the oath without any assistance during Sunday's short ceremony, before he was guided by Gyanendra to a seat.
Gyanendra sacked the government and seized total power in February 2005, accusing the administration of corruption and saying it had done too little to tackle the Maoist insurgency.
But the Maoists and a seven-party opposition alliance joined together to mobilise hundreds of thousands on the streets during April in protests which were often violently suppressed.
One man died in a New Delhi hospital Saturday from injuries sustained during a protest in Kathmandu nine days earlier, bringing the total killed in the 19 days of clashes to at least 16.
Last week, Gyanendra buckled under the nationwide protests and agreed in a televised address to reinstate parliament dissolved in 2002, after earlier asking the opposition to name a premier.
Maoist rebel forces announced a three-month ceasefire Thursday to ""motivate"" political leaders to call elections to a constituent assembly -- their key demand for joining mainstream political life.
The Maoists, who control large parts of the countryside, are seen as key to any long term solution to Nepal's problems.
There was no immediate word from them after Friday's short first sitting of parliament. The deputy speaker said that legislators would on Sunday discuss plans for elections to a new body to redraft the 1990 constitution.
The current constitution gives the king powers to dismiss the government and take control of the 90,000-strong military.
Banners at rallies have warned politicians that they are being closely watched to ensure there is no repeat of the king's power grab.
But analysts have warned of months of continued wrangling and potential instability because of the complex constitutional issues. The king's future role remains unclear.

"5027",20061770,"Title: Asian people power wins new success as Nepal king bows to protests.rtf; Date: May 2, 2006 Tuesday 2:23 AM GMT; Text: ""People power"" in a continent with 60 percent of the world's population proved its potency in Nepal after street demonstrations forced the king to hand over absolute rule of the country.
While hardly representing rebellion sweeping Asia, it is the latest concession after crippling protests forced the premier to step down in Thailand and the government to give ground over fuel prices in Malaysia.
In the Philippines, tens of thousands took to the streets on Labour Day calling for the ouster of President Gloria Arroyo -- as they achieved with her predecessor Joseph Estrada in 2001.
Some analysts said events indicated a stronger desire by the public, particularly in Asia's newer democracies, to play a key part in the future of their nations.
In Nepal, parliament sat for the first time in four years on Friday following three weeks of street protests against the king's absolute rule.
A largely united front by seven opposition parties and Maoist rebels, who have fought a decade-long pro-republic rebellion, forced the king to climb down in the face of a general strike.
""Ideas about democracy and the role of people in society is really getting into the minds of the people across Asia,"" said P.G. Rajamohan, research fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, New Delhi.
""It clearly implies that the people are realising their power, their responsibility and their effective role in formalising the political system of that country.""
In Nepal, academics and diplomats said the Maoists -- who effectively control large parts of the countryside -- were crucial in mobilising support and bringing villagers into the capital Kathmandu for protests.
But in Thailand, Bangkok's middle class rose up in February against prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in a movement that eventually drove him from office.
The protests began in anger at a 1.9-billion-dollar stock sale by Thaksin's family, which his critics said highlighted their claims that he had used his five years in office to benefit his vast business empire.
The movement was led largely by a handful of rich and influential men who opposed Thaksin, and who managed to successfully tap in to middle class discontent in Bangkok.
He finally stood down after an April 2 election highlighted a sharp divide in the country.
But Thaksin could still stand in new elections. His party remains the dominant force in Thai politics, raising questions about what -- if anything -- has changed after months of turmoil.
The differences between the two nations could be seen by the roles played by the two kings, with Nepalese King Gyanendra forced to recall parliament after calling for the opposition to name a new prime minister following weeks of street protests.
In Thailand, the hugely influential king rebuffed calls for him to appoint a new premier.
""In Thailand, even when people asked the king to interfere he said no. He said it will endanger the political process,"" noted political scientist Rabindra Khanal of Kathmandu's Tribhuwan University.
Kalim Bahadur, head of central Asian studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said leaders of popular revolts studied the tactics of others in the region.
But he added: ""They are entirely different situations and circumstances.""
In Malaysia, where public protests are not common, there has been an upsurge of people power in recent months with a series of protests against fuel-price hikes.
Riot police have used batons and water cannon to disperse rallies held at Kuala Lumpur's iconic Petronas Towers and protesters have been arrested and beaten at the demonstrations which represent a rare challenge to government authority.
Petrol costs are an extremely sensitive issue in Malaysia where a strong car culture reigns. Stung by the reaction, the government has announced initiatives to soften the blow of the price hikes.
Alex Silva, 37, who took to the streets in the popular revolt, backed by the military, that saw Philippines leader Estrada toppled in 2001 over a corruption scandal, said he saw similarities in pan-Asian revolts.
Now a restaurateur in Kathmandu, he said: ""I think there is kind of a process of people empowerment in Asia. You can see that people are organising themselves.""

 Dhaka: Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri on Wednesday 10 September warned that the sale of weapons by Israel to India could disturb the balance of power in South Asia.
 ""By visits of that nature in which the primary purpose seems to be the sale of ultra-modern and strategic weaponry aimed at disturbing the balance of power in South Asia, ultimately it will be the poor people of South Asia who will pay,"" he told reporters during a visit to the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka.
Daily Times web site, Lahore, in English 11 Sep 03""To that extent I think it is most unfortunate,"" he added.
 Mr Kasuri, who arrived here earlier on Wednesday, was commenting on military cooperation between India and Israel, in focus during an ongoing visit by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to New Delhi. He said Islamabad wanted friendly ties with all South Asian countries, including India, but at the same time was ready to defend itself. ""We do not have aggressive intentions against any country. But we have taken all possible precautions in all fields to defend every inch of our country,"" he said.
 Mr Kasuri said Islamabad would ""not compete with India in the form of a military race, but we will do all that it takes to maintain a minimum credible deterrent"".
 Mr Kasuri was in Dhaka to extend a formal invitation to the Bangladeshi prime minister for a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to be held in Islamabad. He held official talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart Morshed Khan and also met Finance Minister Saifur Rahman. He is also expected to meet opposition leader Sheikh Hasina tomorrow (Friday) 12 September before leaving for Nepal.

"2679",20043548,"Title: Men using brothels new targets in Asian anti-trafficking drive.rtf; Date: June 28, 2004 Monday; Text: Captive girls in brothels around Asia make a mockery of government pledges to curb sex slavery, so activists have a new target -- the men who use them.
""How would you feel if someone did this to your daughter?"" asks one of the posters that will soon greet Singaporean men arriving on Indonesia's Batam island, notorious for weekend sex jaunts.
Delegates from Southeast Asian nations declared at a conference in Indonesia in March that all countries should deal with the underlying demand which fuels the flesh trade.
""The approach should be aimed at bringing about behaviour change in men and adolescent males,"" a conference statement said.
A total of 10 Asian nations were accused in a US State Department report this month of either not doing enough to stop girls being tricked, sold or kidnapped into sex slavery, or of doing nothing at all.
Malaysia is not among them, but the plight of a desperate girl on an 18th floor window ledge in Kuala Lumpur this year illustrated that even a country the United States describes as ""making significant efforts"" to combat trafficking still has a problem.
Behind her, police found when they broke into an apartment padlocked from the outside, were 15 women from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam who were being held as sex slaves for the use of paying clients.
Several Asian countries condemned in the US report for lack of action against human trafficking protested that they had been unfairly singled out.
North Korea, which along with Myanmar and Bangladesh is ranked in the lowest Tier Three, called the report ""sheer fabrication"".
Myanmar's military regime blamed US sanctions, saying they ""undermine our economy, taking away resources that could be used to fight human trafficking effectively"".
The Philippines, on the Tier Two Watchlist of countries deemed in danger of being downgraded -- along with Japan, India, Laos, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam -- complained the report was ""unfair"".
But Japan was contrite, saying it would try to do better and announced plans to submit a bill to parliament next year on punishment for human traffickers, who are currently dealt with only under immigration or anti-prostitution laws.
Japan's sex industry, hosted by at least 40,000 women, mainly from the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia, Eastern Europe and China, is widely acknowledged as worth 85 billion dollars a year.
Many men who use Asian brothels believe that it is simply a commercial transaction with benefits on both sides, activists say.
""Some men think they are doing a good deed by paying for sex in Batam, that the girls will starve in their villages,"" said Saleemah Ismail, manager of the Batam project run by the Singapore chapter of the United Nations Development Fund for Women.
But up to 40 percent of the estimated 19,000 sex workers in Batam are under 18, Saleemah told the Singapore Straits Times, announcing that the poster campaign would begin on July 1.
Like girls in brothels around the region, many are tricked with fake job offers into leaving their villages or home countries, but find themselves sold as prostitutes and unable to escape.
The US government estimates that up to 800,000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year, more than half of them for sexual exploitation, and that the multi-billion-dollar trade ranks among the fastest growing transnational crimes.
The huge profits attract crime syndicates, as in Japan where the ""yakuza"" are often involved, and the rich and powerful bosses are rarely prosecuted.
Instead, in some countries, it is the victims themselves who are punished.
In Malaysia ""they're treated like criminals,"" said Ivy Josiah, executive director of the Women's Aid Organisation.
The girls, who often lack proper identification and travel documents when freed in police raids, end up in detention camps before being deported while ""the system protects the pimps and the syndicates,"" she said.
Josiah added, however, that ""there is renewed fervour among Malaysian authorities in nabbing the bigger fish"".
Several Asian governments have indicated recently that they plan more strenuous efforts against trafficking, but activists say action often does not match the words, or is too weak to be effective against the growing tide of profit-driven exploitation.
In Cambodia those behind the trade are alleged to include well-connected businesspeople, members of the armed forces, gangsters and government officials.
""Most people being prosecuted are small-time operators further down the ladder while the real leaders never get caught,"" said Cambodian women's Crisis Centre chairwoman Oung Chan Thol.
Legislation that would give officials more power to arrest and prosecute ringleaders is now being considered, and the government last month launched a billboard campaign aimed at informing victims about how they can escape brothels and receive help.
For girls who are not allowed out of the brothels and see only their captors and clients th"

 Birtamod, Jhapa: The long-awaited verification report of the Bhutanese refugees living in Khudunabari camp was made public here today inside the camp amidst tight security. The verification report has recognized only 2.4 per cent refugees as genuine Bhutanese.
 Likewise, 70.55 per of them have been identified as the ones who left Bhutan willingly; 24.2 per cent as non-Bhutanese; and the rest 2.85 per cent as the Bhutanese with criminal backgrounds.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 19 Jun 03
Of the total 12,183 refugees verified one-and-half-years ago, only 293 people of 74 families (2.4 per cent) have been categorized as genuine Bhutanese, while the largest number of Bhutanese - 8,595 people of the 2,182 families (70.55 per cent) - have been categorized as the ones who left their country willingly.
 The report said that 2,948 of 817 families (24.2 per cent) belong to the non-Bhutanese category and 347 people of 85 families (2.85 per cent) belong to the third category or people having criminal backgrounds.
 Following the publication of the report, the refugees expressed strong discontent over the fact that majority of them have been lumped into the second category.  passage omitted
 Officials of Nepal-Bhutan Joint Verification Team (JVT) had finalized the categorization process of the refugees in Thimpu before the 14th round of Joint Ministerial Committee meeting (JMC) concluded in Kathmandu.
 In 1993, Nepal and Bhutan had, in principle, agreed to categorize the Bhutanese into four categories: genuine Bhutanese, Bhutanese who left the country willingly, Bhutanese with criminal background and non-Bhutanese. The 14th round meeting of the JMC had approved the categorization of verified refugees. Earlier, the JVT had also verified 88 refugees left out during the verification about one-and-half-year ago.
 Sector secretaries of the camp had read out the result of the long-awaited report amidst a huge gathering of the refugees. A large number of army and police personnel were put on high alert outside the camp since early morning, anticipating violence after the publication of the report.

 Kathmandu, 18 July: The INSAS Indian National Small Arms System rifles purchased from India on a partial grant basis have appeared faulty while being used. A security as received says the weapons imported in large quantities have not performed as expected.
 When Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was in office the last time, weapons were imported from Belgium and the United States.  passage omitted: names of weapons But after pressure from India it was decided that the INSAS rifles would be bought from India. According to the source, its performance has not been up to expectation.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 Jul 04
According to the source 15,000 INSAS rifles have been imported so far on the partial grant basis. Preparations are under way for the import of a further 10,000 rifles. The source claims, the agreement reached around mid May 2004 with India was also for the import of the INSAS rifles. India banned the flight of the aircraft carrying the Belgian weapons over its airspace to put pressure on Nepal and the aircraft remained in Kazakastan for three days. Later the Indians agreed to let the aircraft use its airspace after special requests were made.
 According to the source, soon after the purchase of weapons from Belgium and the United States, the then Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes telephoned the then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and expressed dissatisfaction at the purchases and said the Indian INSAS rifles were modern, reliable and cheaper.
 The source says the Indian INSAS rifles were imported only because of pressure from India. There has been no official agreement with India on this. These weapons have been included in the Indian defence aid package. A security official said, ""we don't have to ask for the INSAS weapons, they include it in the security package"". He said it was not easy to tell India, we do not want the INSAS rifles, because it is supplying us many kinds of aid including helicopters.
 But another high ranking military officer said, the INSAS rifles have their own importance when the Americans were not supplying enough of the M16 A2 rifles. He said, ""although it could not be compared with the M16, it was much better than the old SLRs. The source claims, the INSAS weapons which failed in the early tests have not been in full use in the Indian military itself"".

Speaking at a press conference in Chitwan [district in central Nepal] today [19 October], Mahara claimed that the king did not give his statement to the commission because he is not positive about the political change in the country and is not accountable to the people. Mahara reiterated that restructuring of the Nepalese army was necessary and said that it would be tantamount to accepting the monarchy in the old form if no changes were made in the old army [Royal Nepalese Army]. Mahara, who is also the coordinator of the Maoist talks team, claimed that the Maoist arms have caused no hindrance in the ongoing peace talks with the seven parties. He said that there were two governments and two armies in the country and the Maoists were demanding constituent assembly to merge the governments and the armies into one.

AP Special Correspondent
NEW YORK (AP) - Republican National Convention co-stars Laura Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger commended President Bush to the country for four more years Tuesday night, hailing him as a man of strength leavened by compassion. ""You can count on him, especially in a crisis,"" said the first lady.
""He's a man of perseverance. He's a man of inner strength. He is a leader who doesn't flinch, doesn't waver, does not back down,"" added the Austrian-born California governor in a speech that also promised recent immigrants they are welcome in the GOP.
""We Republicans admire your ambition. We encourage your dreams. We believe in your future,"" said the actor-turned-politician in one of several speeches crafted to show the softer side of a party known for its conservatism.
The effort to flesh out an image of the president as something more than a resolute commander in chief resulted in something akin to a prime-time Bush family hour, with twins Jenna and Barbara teasing their father gently in a brief, joint appearance at the podium. ""We are so proud to be here tonight to introduce someone who read us bedtime stories, picked up carpool, made our favorite peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches and cheered for us when we made a goal, even when it was for the wrong team,"" Jenna said.
Schwarzenegger and the first lady took their turns at the Madison Square Garden podium as 2,508 delegates formally bestowed their nomination on the president for a second term in office. ""Four more years,"" they chanted in unison - then and many times more throughout the night.
Republicans met inside their heavily fortified convention hall as police made more than 560 arrests in the surrounding streets on a day heavy with non-violent protest. By evening, authorities wrapped an entire midtown Manhattan block in orange netting, working to contain demonstrators who had vowed to march on the Garden itself.
Bush, locked in a tight re-election race, campaigned across three battleground states and worked to extinguish a convention-week controversy of his own making. ""In this different kind of war, we may never sit down at a peace table. But make no mistake about it, we are winning, and we will win"" the war on terror, he told an American Legion convention in Tennessee, one day after saying he didn't think victory would be possible.
""I probably needed to be more articulate"" in earlier comments, he conceded in a radio interview with conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.
""Let me tell you something, we can, we must and we will win the war on terror,"" Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry insisted as he arrived in Tennessee for his turn Wednesday speaking to the American Legion.
Earlier, Kerry's campaign settled on plans to place $45 million in television advertising in 20 battleground states through Election Day. The commercials will run on broadcast stations and cable, and include appeals to minority voters whom Democrats need to turn out in large numbers on Nov. 2 if they are to deny Bush a second term.
A poll by The Washington Post showed the race to be a dead heat, 48 percent apiece, but found that the president moving ahead of his rival on national security issues and pulling into a virtual tie on handling of the economy.
Bush arrives in New York on Wednesday, a day ahead of a nomination acceptance speech that is expected to sketch out a second-term agenda. Vice President Dick Cheney addresses the gathering Wednesday night.
Republican convention planners scripted an evening that reintroduced the theme of compassionate conservatism that helped Bush win the White House four years ago.
A parade of speakers strode to the podium with a backdrop that read - ""People of Compassion."" They praised the president's efforts to battle AIDS, combat breast cancer, promote adoption and enact far-reaching educational reforms. ""I am proof that the blessings of liberty are within reach of every American,"" said Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, an African-American.
Both the first lady and Schwarzenegger hailed Bush's leadership in terms that bordered on extravagant in speeches that did double political duty. For the first lady, that meant a glimpse at the personal side of her husband; for the governor, an appeal to new and unregistered voters from overseas who are not part of the president's conservative base.
""No American president wants to go to war,"" said Mrs. Bush, neither Lincoln nor Roosevelt nor her own husband.
But in a description of a commander in chief that most Americans never see, she said, ""I remember some very quiet nights at the dinner table"" after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ""George was weighing grim scenarios and ominous intelligence and potentially even more devastating attacks.""

Leaders of the seven-party alliance including former premier Girija Prasad Koirala attended the session in the historic town of Lalitpur on the outskirts of Kathmandu, at which motions were put forward urging the reconvening of parliament and a return to democracy.
""Since we're not allowed to go inside parliament, we have to do it in an another place,"" said Gopal Man Shrestha, acting president of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party.
""The king has misused the constitution and is ruling the country through ordinances.""
Former elected and appointed members attended what was billed as a ""joint session of the lower and upper houses"" of parliament held in a large square  jammed with about 2,500 people who shouted slogans in support of democracy.
Protests have been slowly building since Gyanendra sacked the government and seized control of Nepal February 1. He said he grabbed power because squabbling politicians had failed to end an increasingly deadly nine-year Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 11,000 lives.
Last month, the seven mainstream political parties, longtime adversaries,  buried their differences and joined hands in a bid to bring back democratic rule in the impoverished kingdom.
Since Gyandendra lifted emergency rule in April, the royal-appointed government has allowed demonstrations away from the city centre.

""It is not possible to hold the election as a number of technical processes were to be completed and that the time left was too inadequate to complete necessary preparations before the poll could be held,"" Bhoj Raj Pokhrel told a press conference.
The constituent assembly is a major component of Nepal's peace process involving seven Nepalese mainstream political parties and former Maoist rebels.
The assembly, when formed, is to write a new constitution for Nepal.
The eight parties, including the former Maoists, had proposed the assembly election be held June 20.
At the press conference, Pokharel read out a letter the commission sent to Nepal's interim government on Thursday stating that it is technically impossible to conduct the election by mid-June.
The commission has also asked the government to announce new date for the election ""that will be appropriate for voters, candidates, political parties, election staff and observers.
With most of the election laws yet to be formulated, the commission said it will need at least 110 days after all relevant laws have been put in place for proper preparations for voting day.
Nepal's prevailing law and order situation is ""anything but satisfactory"" for a free and fair poll, the election chief added.
The constituent assembly idea came when the mainstream political parties and then warring Maoist rebels signed a pact in November 2005 aimed at ending Nepal's decade-old armed insurgency.
Once elected, the assembly would also decide at its first meeting by majority vote whether or not to keep monarchy in the country.
The Maoists who have joined Nepal's interim parliament as well as the new interim government are demanding the planned assembly election should be held without any further delay.
In the event the assembly election is delayed, Nepal should declare itself a republican state by abolishing monarchy straightaway, they insist.
The former rebels have also threatened what they call urban-based peaceful agitation to pressure the government to hold the election as earlier planned.

 Baglung, west Nepal , 14 April: A food crisis has emerged in the remote areas of Baglung and Myagdi districts.
 Locals from Galkot and Bartung in Baglung and north and west of Myagdi said it has become difficult to eke out a living after the food crisis.

 Grains are not available in the remote districts of Baglung for two years after Maoists destroyed two food depots built to supply food grains to the remote areas of the district. Plans for the reconstruction of the depots have been shelved for fear Maoists will loot the grains.  passage omitted

They stood at the rostrum condemning threats of aggression and oppression as the Middle East stood on the brink of a likely US- led attack against Iraq. They also watched in horror at the developments in Palestine.
At the same time, the leaders said Iraq should comply with the United Nations Security Council resolution to destroy Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction to avert war.
Iranian President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami said Tehran opposed the use of force to change any regime in any country. He was referring to the US intention to get rid of President Saddam Hussein.
""The current frightening world atmosphere makes it imperative for the Non-Aligned Movement to opt for a more affirmative approach toward achieving a peaceful world, a far cry from the struggle for independence in the bygone era of the Cold War,"" he said.
Sixty-three Heads of state or government of NAM member countries gathered here Monday morning to open the summit, which will last until Tuesday.  
Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said global security should be sought through nuclear disarmament, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction as well as balanced and progressive conventional disarmament.
She also called on Saddam Hussein to urgently negotiate a win- win settlement that would ""spare the heroic Iraqi people the agonies of a devastating war.""
Agreeing that weapons of mass destruction do need to be eliminated, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said it was essential for Iraq to comply fully with the obligations it had accepted, including disarmament.
""As a fellow member of NAM, this is our sincere advice to Iraq. We also expect that if Iraq fully complies, the sanctions against that country should be lifted,"" he said.  
Touching on terrorism, Vajpayee called for the conclusion of negotiations at the United Nations on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, in an apparent reference to the United States, said the threat of a military action by a powerful country, let alone just to act on the basis of or simply to demonstrate its might or superiority, was clearly a mistake.
""No matter how powerful the country is, that does not give it the right to act unilaterally against the other,"" said the president whose father Sukarno, the first Indonesian president, was among the founders of the 47-year old Non-Aligned Movement.
Noting that many regions of NAM continued to experience conflict, particularly in Africa, Mozambican President Joaquim Alberto Chissano urged all the NAM members and the international community as a whole to lend their unconditional support to those still in conflict to search for peaceful settlement.  
Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the island republic believed that all actions in respect of Iraq by the United States and others should respect international law and resolutions of the Security Council.
""In this crisis, we must not lose sight of the humanitarian aspect. The Iraqi people have suffered enough,"" he said.
Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong called on the United Nations to push back by all means the war for the sake of world peace.
""We also call for an end to power politics, embargo and sanctions against a number of countries, which have, for many years, caused tremendous hardships and sufferings for their people, particularly those imposed against Cuba,"" he said.
Nepalese Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand echoed the sentiments expressed by other NAM leaders by calling for a durable solution to enable Palestine and Israel to live as neighbors within secure and recognized boundaries.
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction had loomed larger while regional conflicts, unilateral tendencies, distrust and intolerance had caused greater friction and instability in various parts of the world.
""Progress towards disarmament has stalled,"" he said, adding that while NAM continued to tackle traditional security issues, it must, at the same time, give equal attention to critical economic and social issues that affect human security and development.
Zambian President Levy Patrick Mwanawasa appealed to the people of Israel and Palestine to return to the negotiating table and revive the peace process.
Formally founded in 1961, the Movement is the largest grouping of developing countries outside the United Nations. Its summit held approximately every three years provides member states with a platform to address diplomatic, economic, developmental and social issues of the day.

According to sources, these supplies had dried up, leaving the king pleading for arms to combat the Maoists.
  To strengthen Gyanendra's hands before he left Jakarta for China on Sunday, India decided to restore the supply of weapons, the sources said.
  PM's assurance to Left
  PRIME MINISTER Manmohan Singh on Monday night told leaders of the Left parties that India will link resumption of military aid to restoration of democracy in Nepal.
  Left party sources said the PM informed the leaders that he had made it clear to King Gyanendra that New Delhi's position was based on the functioning of a constitutional monarchy and Parliamentary democracy in Nepal. (PTI)
  While India stressed the need to revoke emergency in Nepal and restore multi-party democracy at the earliest, the king spoke of his compulsions and assured he would begin restoring political freedoms as soon as possible.
  New Delhi maintains only a multi-party democracy ""Things were getting nowhere,"" an official source said, adding, ""The supply chain can be turned off"" if Gyanendra does not begin taking certain measures towards political reconciliation and a ""road map"" to restore democracy.
  While the Chinese were ""not a threat"", well-placed sources said India needs the Maoist threat to be tackled effectively, as it directly impacts the Naxalite movement that has spread across nine Indian states.
  Also, it was difficult to refuse pleas from the Nepalese to meet them in a third country, the sources said, even though the Indian leaders were ""extremely reluctant"" to agree to the meeting. But India could not hold out on Bangladesh and said it was ready for SAARC. Dhaka, however, is not likely to offer fresh dates in a hurry, sources said.

"4101",20053466,"Title: Experts warn on Nepal capital's quake preparedness.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 6, 2005 Sunday
Excerpt from report by Nepalnews.com website on 6 November
Experts have warned that hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley are ill-prepared to handle a major earthquake. A survey conducted by the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) has revealed that 80 per cent of the hospitals in Kathmandu would be completely damaged if an earthquake of 8.0 Richter scale hit the valley. Currently, there are 14 major hospitals operating in the capital valley.
Addressing an interaction organized by Physicians for Social Responsibility-Nepal (PSRN) at Kathmandu Model Hospital on Saturday [5 November], general secretary of NSET Amod Mani Dixit said a major quake could destroy up to 60 per cent of the total buildings [in] the capital valley.
A study conducted by NSET for Kathmandu Metropolitan City some time back projected that up to 40,000 people could be killed and around 100,000 others would be injured seriously if an earthquake of 8.0 Richter scale or above hit the valley. [passage omitted]
Meanwhile, talking to Nepalnews, Dixit - who recently returned to Kathmandu after visiting quake-hit areas of Pakistan - said Nepal needed to learn lessons from all the quakes in the Himalayan region including Pakistan. ""The key lesson is preparedness. Despite facing a huge risk of a major quake we are still largely unprepared,"" he added.
""There is a need to integrate natural disaster preparedness strategy in the national development plans from the centre all the way down to villages. We have got knowledge, skills and construction of quake-resistant houses is also affordable,"" said Dixit.  He dismissed reports that risk to Nepal had gone down due to September quake in Pakistan. 
""In fact, a high risk of a major quake is impending in Nepal than any time in the post. Huge increase in population and rapid growth in house construction have only added to such risks,"" he warned.

 Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 27 October
 Butwal [west Nepal], 26 October: The United States of America has expressed its concerns over the 72m rupees military assistance that China pledged for Nepal. We have watched it closely. This is not a good indication, the US has said.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 27 Oct 05
US Ambassador to Nepal James F. Moriarty said in Butwal on Wednesday [26 October] that Nepal could buy weapons from any country of its choice for its security. ""But I don't think it is a good indication to buy weapons from China at this moment,"" said Moriarty.
 Army chief Pyar Jung Thapa, after returning from his China visit, had said that Nepal's northern neighbour had pledged 72m rupees in military assistance.
 Ambassador Moriarty reiterated that the US would suspend its military assistance until democracy is restored in Nepal. He said that the US was ready to extend any kind of support for the restoration of democracy in Nepal.
 Parliamentary elections held without the participation of the political parties will have no meaning. There is no ground to believe that a fair election will be held at this situation, said the American ambassador.
 The failure to hold talks with the political parties and the restrictive media ordinance are the proof that there is no intention to hold fair and free elections. These are steps that aim to secure legitimacy to rule. Moriarty was speaking at an interaction organized by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) Rupandehi district branch.
 The new media ordinance does not reflect the democratic spirit of the government. In addition, the election code of conduct issued by the Election Commission is also not encouraging, Moriarty said. He cautioned the political parties against forging ties with the Maoists until the rebels give up violence and support the democratic system.
 ""I have no good friends in the Maoist party. So, I cannot speak accurately about them,"" he said. He wished that the Maoists would prolong the current cease-fire and take initiative to find a solution to the problem.
 During his tour of the western districts, Moriarty is scheduled to meet and discuss with army officers, traders, industrialists, local bodies and the chiefs of different non-governmental organizations. He visited Palpa district on Wednesday [26 October] and will visit the American Information centre at Bhairahawa on Thursday, he said.

"4946",20062918,"Title: Concern mounts over Nepal PM's health.rtf; Date: July 12, 2006 Wednesday 9:50 AM GMT; Text: Concern mounted on Wednesday over the health of Nepal's elderly and frail prime minister, who is battling ill health that has led some politicians and analysts to say he should step down or name a temporary stand-in.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 85, was discharged on Wednesday after nine days in hospital with pneumonia but one of his doctors said he had still not fully recovered.
""Though his treatment has not been completed, he can be medicated in his residence,"" said Madhu Ghimire.
Koirala was admitted to hospital on July 3 but has had respiratory problems for more than a year and recently gave up a lifelong smoking habit on doctors' advice.
During a recent trip to Bangkok, he received laser prostate treatment but it was never made clear how serious this condition was.
Koirala, a popular political figure who has served as premier several times before, took over the reins in late April after mass public protests forced King Gyanendra to give up absolute rule of the Himalayan kingdom.
But now some Nepalese leaders say Koirala's poor health is hampering efforts to put the country back on track.
""The government has many tasks to accomplish but they remain unfinished due to the prime minister's ill health,"" Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the second largest party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), told AFP.
Analysts said Koirala's illness and inability to fulfill his prime ministerial duties could affect the progress of a vital peace process with Maoist rebels that has been slow in getting off the ground.
The Maoists, fighting since 1996 for a ""people's republic"", agreed with the government last month to draft an interim constitution, paving the way for a power-sharing administration that would include the rebels. The two sides have already declared a ceasefire.
""His worsening health could further hamper the slowed peace process,"" said political scientist Lokraj Baral.
""The prime minister should at least designate a person who could take some of his responsibilities,"" said Baral, a retired professor at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan University.
But Nara Hari Acharya, defeated 10 months ago when he opposed Koirala for leadership of the Nepali Congress, the biggest political party, believes the party should seek a replacement prime minister.
""There've been no cabinet meetings since the premier fell ill. Government activities have not run smoothly so his responsibilities should be transferred,"" said Acharya.
This view was rejected by a western diplomat, who noted that Koirala was considered the ""grand old man"" of Nepali politics and there was no one who commands the same respect and would be able to lead the fractious seven-party coalition government.
In addition, Koirala was an acceptable choice for Nepal's Maoists and ""could negotiate"" with them, the diplomat said, asking to remain unnamed.
Without Koirala the already complicated political landscape could deteriorate rapidly, he added.
""It could get quite messy because it's not clear who would become leader of the Nepali Congress, let alone prime minister.""
Koirala's doctors said on Tuesday the prime minister's health was improving.
""He's getting stronger. The prime minister strolled around the hospital for about 15 minutes in the morning,"" said Ghimire.
The Maoists say Koirala's ill health has complicated matters but are not pushing for a replacement.
""Obviously the prime minister's ill health has delayed the peace process but we don't see it as necessary to search for an alternative,"" said Dina Nath Sharma, a member of the three-member Maoist peace talks team.

 Biratnagar [east Nepal], 21 August: Maoists have captured 57.7 acres of land belonging to human rights activist Krishna Pahadi in Thalaha VDC in Morang district [east Nepal]. Pahadi told Kantipur on Sunday [21 August] that the Maoists had prevented his family from using agricultural products from the land since earlier this year.

 The Maoists had also pressured land users not to pay the Pahadi family money for using the land.
 ""At that time, the government was preparing to extend my detention. The Maoists were preparing to capture my land. Both the government and the Maoists are trying to make my family bankrupt. But I will face the challenge,"" Pahadi said.

"7294",20115989,"Title: 56 killed as wave of violence rolls across Iraq.rtf; Date: August 15, 2011 Monday; Text: KUT, Aug. 15 -- Bomb blasts ripped through more than a dozen Iraqi cities Monday morning, killing 56 people - most of them in the southern city of Kut - in a wave of violence that shattered what had been a relatively peaceful holy month of Ramadan.
The violence struck from the northern city of Kirkuk to the capital of Baghdad to the southern Shiite cities of Najaf, Kut and Karbala, and emphasized the persistent ability of insurgents to wreak havoc at a time when Iraqi officials are weighing whether they are able to protect the country without the assistance of American troops.
The blasts were coordinated to go off in the morning and included a combination of parked car bombs, roadside bombs and a suicide bomber driving a vehicle that rammed into a police station.
The scope of the violence - seven explosions went off in different towns in Diyala province alone - emphasized the still dangerous ability of insurgents to coordinate and carry out attacks despite repeated crackdowns by Iraqi and U.S. forces.
The worst violence came in the southern city of Kut, 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad, where twin explosions went off as construction workers were gathered in a market selling generators and other appliances.
Police spokesman Lt. Col. Dhurgam Mohammed Hassan said the first bomb went off in a freezer used to keep drinks cold. Then as rescuers and onlookers gathered, a parked car bomb exploded.
The head of the provincial security committee in Wasit province, Shamil Mansour, said 35 people were killed; another official put the number of injured at 64.
Mansour blamed the security breach on a political system that appoints people to government offices based on their sectarian and political affiliation inside of their ability or experience.
In Diyala province, seven bombs went off in the capital of Baquba and towns nearby, said Faris al-Azawi, the spokesman for the Diyala health directorate. Five soldiers were killed in Baquba while five people were killed in other attacks around the province.
Just outside the holy city of Najaf, a suicide car bomber plowed his vehicle into a checkpoint outside a police building, said Luay al-Yassiri, head of the Najaf province security committee.
Police opened fire on the vehicle when the driver refused to stop at the checkpoint, and then the vehicle exploded. Al-Yassiri said four people were killed and 32 injured; among the dead were two policemen and two civilians. Firefighters sprayed water on burning cars while a body covered with a red sheet was loaded into a police vehicle.
Just outside Karbala, a parked car bomb targeting a police station killed three policemen and injured 14 others, according to two police officers. Neither wanted to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
In the northern city of Tikrit, two men wearing explosives belts drove into a heavily guarded government compound wearing military uniforms which helped them avoid notice by the guards, said Mohammed al-Asi, the provincial spokesman.
The men parked their vehicle and then walked to a building housing the anti-terrorism police. When the men approached the building, the guards ordered them to stop and then opened fire. One bomber was immediately killed but the other managed to get inside the building before blowing himself up and killed three people, al-Asi said. Ten people were also injured in the attack.
It was another embarrassing security breach for security officials at the compound. Earlier this year, insurgents managed to penetrate the compound's security and attack a mosque where many prominent officials were at prayer.
Al-Asi said 16 people were also injured in the city of Balad when a roadside bomb went off near a fuel truck.
In the northern city of Kirkuk, a car bomb exploded next to a police patrol Monday morning, injuring four police officers. Then about thirty minutes later one person was killed when a motorcycle with a bomb planted inside it exploded. Late Sunday, four bombs also blew up near a Syrian Orthodox Church in Kirkuk. No one was injured in the attack but the walls of the church were damaged.
In Baghdad, a parked car bomb exploded near a convoy carrying officials from the Ministry of Higher Education, said police and health officials. Eight people were wounded, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The minister was not inside the convoy.
Violence has dropped considerably in Iraq from the heyday of the war when such bloody bombings were an almost daily occurrence. But the persistence of the violence in Iraq, albeit at a lower level, underscores the ability of insurgents to undermine the country's security.
The blasts were the first major act of violence since Iraq's political leaders earlier this month announced that they would begin negotiations with the United States over whether to keep a small number of American forces in the country past Dec. 31. "
"3800",2005448,"Title: Jharkhand's warrior Khairwar community's penury existence.rtf; Date: July 14, 2005 Thursday 12:37 PM  EST; Text: Chatra (Jharkhand), July 14 (ANI) : Khairwar, the warrior tribal community of Jharkhand's Chatra District, was once popular for its strong and powerful presence, but today, its members have been compelled to lead a life of penury in the wake of a Naxal assault on their homes in the mid-1990s.
  Chatra is the heartland of Naxalite influence in the state. Farming is the only means of income for the peasants of the area, but marauding gangs which are a constant threat, prevent them from performing their chores.
   None of the 50 families in the village is able to afford two square meals a day. The community is now living in the campus of a ""Bazaar Samiti""(Market committee) on the outskirts of Chatra.
   Authorities say they are coming up with various schemes to rehabilitate the villagers.
   ""We are trying to promote women group activities in a strong way, but it's not that only women groups are being promoted. We would like to promote men groups also. Not only that, if anyone would like to take up any activity like loans, they will be given preference. We will make sure that economic upliftment takes place along with their safety,"" said Himani Pandey, District Collector of Chatra.
   The Naxalites have targeted rich landowners and government offices. Police suspect that the Naxalites have links with Maoists in Nepal. 
  Agriculture is the primary occupation of all the tribal communities in Jharkhand with paddy being the staple crop, which is cultivated during the Kharif season. Due to lack of rainfall and alternative irrigation facilities during Rabi and summer, most of the poor tribal communities undertake dryland crop cultivation during this period besides non-timber forest produce collection, labor and migration. The advanced tribal communities like Oraons undertake cash crop cultivation with the help of irrigation pumpsets.
  Electrification will have less impact on economically inactive tribal communities like the Mundas, Paharias and Santhals unless it is provided along with other services like input and market linkage, technology and knowledge transfer about cash crop cultivation, financial linkage for availing loans to purchase irrigation pumpsets and risk mitigation techniques.
  Undulating terrain, high forest cover and abundant mineral resources characterize Jharkhand, which was carved out of Bihar in the year 2000. It receives high rainfall during Kharif season (primary agricultural season) and minimal or no rainfall during Rabi and summer season. The tribal population in Jharkhand is very high (7.5 million) contributing to 28 percent of the total population. 
  The important tribes are Mundas, Santhals, Paharias and Oraons. The average land holding size of the tribal population in Jharkhand is two acres. The tribal population of Jharkhand can be segregated into economically active and economically inactive tribals. 
  Economically active tribal populations constitute those tribals who have access to market, technology and irrigation infrastructure. These tribals are involved in cash crop cultivation like vegetables and oilseeds and employ advanced agricultural cropping practices (inputs like fertilizers, pesticides and implements like irrigation pumpsets and power tillers). 
  Their average household income from agriculture after deducting input cost is approximately Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000. Due to availability of irrigation pumpsets, they are engaged in cultivation throughout out the year even when there is no rainfall. The Oraons are an economically active tribal population residing in the South Chotanagpur belt of Jharkhand. 
  Economically inactive tribal population constitutes those tribal communities who are involved in subsistence level agriculture due lack of access to market, technology and credit. 
  They cultivate paddy during the Kharif season when there is rainfall and dryland crops (crops not requiring water) during the Rabi season. They either remain unemployed during the summer season or migrate to other areas in search of labor. Their average household income from agriculture and other activities is approximately Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000 and they can be classified as BPL (below poverty line). The Mundas residing in South Chotanagpur belt and the Santhals and Paharias residing in Northeastern Jharkhand fall under economically inactive tribals.
  As far as the Naxal menace is concerned, the state's Chief Minister, Arjun Munda, had said in March this year that he was ready to initiate a dialogue with Naxal guerrillas in the state, but within the framework of the law and only on the condition that they lay down their arms and give up armed struggle. 
  Naxal activities have become a major headache for successive administrations in the state, and already over 510 people have been killed in Naxal violence since Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in November 2000.
  Authorities say Jharkhand is the second worst hit state after Andhra Pradesh, with the united Communist Party of Ind"

"1675",20044658,"Title: Kashmir leaders end conference with call to reduce violence.rtf; Date: December 14, 2004 Tuesday 1:20 PM GMT; Text: Separatists from the Indian and Pakistani zones of Kashmir ended a conference in Nepal Tuesday with a call for renewed efforts to stem violence and rebuild the economy in the troubled region, organizers said.
The four-day meet held behind closed doors in Kathmandu was a rare chance for separatists from both sides of divided Kashmir to discuss the Himalyan region's future among themselves.
""The conference attended by 50 individuals from Jammu and Kashmir, India  and Pakistan discussed ways of ending more than five decades of conflict and establishing a secure and prosperous future for the peoples of this vital region of South Asia,"" said Paolo Cotta-Ramusino, secretary general of the International Pugwash Foundation which organized the meet.
""For the first time in many years, members of political parties, non- governmental organisations and civil society from both sides of the Line of Control were able to meet each other in an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation,"" Cotta-Ramusino told reporters.
Pugwash holds conferences around the world to seek solutions to global problems.
He said the participants discussed issues in a closed forum to hear different viewpoints.
""The meeting did not adopt any resolution as it was not intended to put specific proposals for the parties to decide on the Kashmir issue,"" he said.
Pugwash, which is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, hopes to hold further meetings, but hasn't set a date or venue.
""This open hearted discussion among the participants is expected to help a lot in building confidence among the people of Jammu and Kashmir, promoting contacts and communication between all parties concerned over the issue lingering for the last 57 years,"" he added.
Kashmir is at the center of a conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over the Himalayan region.
Both countries hold part of the state and claim it in full
Muslim rebels, most of them wanting to secede Kashmir from India and join with Muslim-majority Pakistan, launched an insurgency in 1989 that has so far claimed 40,000 lives by official count. Separatists put the toll between 80,000 and 100,000.
India and Pakistan started a peace process early this year with both sides respecting a ceasefire along the de facto border known as the Line of Control. Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil said last week there had been a 60 percent decline in rebel incursions from Pakistan.
""The participants welcomed the resumption of the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan in the hope that a sustained dialogue between the two countries will lead to enhanced confidence and greater cooperation,"" Cotta-Ramusino said.
Participants included leaders of the moderate wing of the main separatist alliance Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Abdul Ghani Bhat, politicians, former ambassadors, retired generals and rights activists from India and Pakistan

The nominations for the Prime Minister are to be registered at the CA Secretariat on Thursday as the CA meeting scheduled later today is due to ratify the committee's decision. 
Article 38 (2) of the Interim Constitution provides that the Prime Minister shall be elected through a majority of the members of the Legislature-Parliament, if consensus cannot be reached. President Ram Baran Yadav has sent a letter to the CA chairman to elect the Prime Minister through the CA as the Maoists could not form a consensus government within seven-days time given to them. The president extended three more days but the political parties could not form the government. No political party commands a simple majority in the 601 CA elected in April that has abolished the 240-year-old dictatorial monarchy. The largest party in the CA is the Maoists with 226 seats while the Nepali Congress, CPN, UML and MJF are the second, third and fourth with 113, 108 and 52 seats respectively. The parties are still holding talks to form the government but the differences is said to be over the portfolio allocation. The Nepali Congress has said it will not join the government unless the defence portfolio is not given to the party as the Congress does not want to give the defence ministry to the Maoists saying that the former rebels cannot head two armies - the national army and their 19,000 combatants living in the UN monitored camps.

 Kathmandu, 6 July: Vice-Chairman of the Council of Minister Dr Tulsi Giri on Wednesday [6 July] disclosed his property details saying he owned just 110 grams of gold. The details made available to government media also said apart from the 100 grams of gold, he did not own anything inside the country.

Giri, who has lived abroad for the past 20 years, did not say whether he owned property outside the country. Although the Corruption Control Act 2002 stipulates that a minister disclose property details within two months after assuming office, Giri took almost five months to disclose the details.
 Tulsi Giri has been placed on a blacklist by a bank for the past four years because a company, in which he was the chairman, has not repaid a loan it took from a bank 20 years ago.
 Tulsi Giri had informed journalists on Tuesday [5 July] that negotiations are underway with the bank to repay the debt.

"7122",20082327,"Title: Nepal votes for first president.rtf; Date: July 19, 2008 Saturday 8:54 AM GMT; Text: Lawmakers in Nepal were voting Saturday for the country's first elected head of state following the abolition of its Hindu monarchy, paving the way for the dominant Maoists to form a government.
The leader of the Maoists, Prachanda, was among the first to vote shortly before noon and told reporters he was sure his party's choice would be the country's new head of state, with an announcement expected later Saturday.
The Maoists are backing die-hard republican Ramraja Prasad Singh, arrested two decades ago for throwing small bombs at parliament and the palace as part of an anti-royal protest.
The country has been stuck in political limbo after a landmark meeting of a newly elected constitutional assembly sacked unpopular king Gyanendra and abolished the 240-year-old Hindu monarchy on May 28.
Interim Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has since resigned, but with no one in power to accept his resignation, he has lingered on as a weak caretaker.
Meanwhile, the former rebels -- who dominate but do not have a majority in the 601-member assembly -- have been unable to muster enough support from two other parties to form a new government.
After failing to agree on who should become president, the three main parties each put forward a candidate. Voting by 594 lawmakers was taking place Saturday by secret ballot, with a simple majority of 298 needed to win.
The three men in the running are ethnic Mahadhesis who hail from the troubled lowland area bordering India known as the Terai, where demands for an autonomous federal state have seen frequent deadly clashes.
Political analysts have said Singh, 73, is the favourite to win, although he is not a member of the Maoist party.
The Maoists, who have 226 seats, have been wooing Terai lawmakers, who have 82 seats.
""If the Maoists are able to secure the support of at least 72 more people, they are going to have their representative elected,"" said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the Nepali-language news weekly Samay.
But after talks between the Maoists and the Mahadhesis on the eve of the vote ended on a sour note, local media reports speculated Saturday that a hung ballot was also a possibility.
No matter who wins, the new head of state will be ""President Ram,"" since all three candidates share the name of the most revered incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.
In the past seven weeks, as arguing continued over the largely symbolic presidential post, Nepal has been largely ungoverned.
The new president will immediately take over some of the ceremonial duties previously performed by ousted king Gyanendra.
The Nepali fiscal year on July 15 ended without a new budget, although the assembly did approve a supplementary spending bill.
The country has lurched from strike to strike, over fuel prices, wages and working conditions.
But once a president is in place, that will pave the way for the formation of a government headed by a prime minister, most likely Prachanda.
""The president will accept the resignation of the (interim) prime minister and then the Maoists can form a government,"" editor Ghimire said.

"6929",20083563,"Title: Strike shuts down Kathmandu after alleged Maoist murders.rtf; Date: November 20, 2008 Thursday 9:36 AM GMT; Text: Protesters shut down the Nepalese capital Kathmandu with a strike Thursday over the abduction and murder of two men, allegedly by the youth wing of the country's ruling Maoists.
The one-day demonstration was called by relatives of the murdered men and supported by opposition parties and student organisations.
Shops and schools across Kathmandu were closed and there was no public transport, as protesters blocked major junctions and smashed the windows of the few private cars that ventured onto the roads.
Nepal's former rebel Maoists came to power after winning elections in May. Their youth wing, the Young Communist League (YCL), has faced persistent accusations of violence and intimidation.
Nirmal Panta, 22, and Pushkar Dangol, 24, were abducted a month ago. Their bodies were found in a district neighbouring Kathmandu on Tuesday.
The Civil Society Struggle Committee, set up by their relatives, accused YCL cadres of being behind the killings.
""We called the strike to warn the Maoist government that their cadre should obey the law,"" said the committee's coordinator, Kishore Khatri Chettri.
""These killings need to be thoroughly investigated and we want the (Maoist) prime minister to apologise,"" said Khatri Chettri.
The YCL has denied any involvement.
Hundreds of riot police were deployed across the capital, as protesters blocked roads in at least 16 places.
Protesters and YCL activists threw stones as several low level clashes erupted but they were quickly dealt with by police.
""We have not made any arrests today as we don't want to inflame the situation,"" said Basundhara Khadka, a police inspector on duty at one protest site.
Laxman Bhatta, a 23-year-old student said he was on the streets to try to force the Maoist government to investigate the killings.
""The Maoists cannot kill innocent civilians and unless they are punished, Maoist cadre will continue this lawless behaviour,"" said Bhatta.

Arun Chand was snatched from his sugar factory by rebels in Chuhabazaar, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
No reason has been given by the rebels for the abduction, but newspaper reports said the factory owed local farmers money.
Lokendra Bahadur Chand called on the Maoist rebels not to harm his son and to free him. He also asked the government and local human rights groups to help secure his release.
The rebels continue to abduct villagers, opponents, students and politicians despite a unilateral cease-fire by the guerrillas.
They announced the cease-fire on Sept. 3, but said they would defend their positions and not attack any government officials or civilians.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996. The insurgency has left some 12,000 people dead.

    According to the report, the reconstruction of infrastructure  damaged during the conflict will cost twice as much as the loss.

"5738",20072890,"Title: Nepal 's king spurns salary.rtf; Date: January 5, 2007 Friday 9:05 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's embattled King Gyanendra and his family have not drawn their annual salary since the new government slapped tax on the royals' income in May, a report said Friday.
The king and family members have not approached the government for the first tranche of their 23.7 million rupee (329,000 dollar) salary and allowances, the English language daily Kathmandu Post reported, quoting unnamed government officials.
The royal palace used to collect its annual household budget within 48 hours of it being announced, the newspaper said.
""It is really surprising the palace has not drawn the money even after six months into the fiscal year,"" the newspaper quoted an official as saying.
Palace officials were not available for comment.
In a landmark proclamation, Nepal's House of Representatives declared last May that the royal family's private property and income would be taxed liked other citizens.
Last month, Gyanendra and his son, Crown Prince Paras, had to pay customs tax to collect shipped goods at the airport, marking a first for the royals.
The government also plans to seize lands owned by royal family members and distribute them to the poor.
The monarch, traditionally revered as the incarnation of a Hindu god, seized power in 2005 in what he said was a bid to end a deadly decade-old Maoist revolt.
The new government came to power after mass protests in which political parties and Maoists combined to force Gyanendra to end 14 months of direct rule in April.
The government earmarked a total of 2.9 million dollars for the royals and upkeep of the palace in its budget for the current fiscal year. Earlier, the government had allocated 10.6 million dollars.
The government and Maoists finalized an interim constitution this month, transferring Gyanendra's role as head of state to the prime minister until at least mid-2007 and paving the way for the rebels to join the government.
The Maoists are pushing to abolish the monarchy. But some other political forces want it to retain a ceremonial role.

"1069",20031583,"Title: Edmund Hillary recalls how Tenzing Norgay saved his life(2).rtf; Date: May 20, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first ascension to the summit of Mount Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary recalled Tuesday how his partner, Tenzing Norgay, saved his life just before they began the historic climb.
Hillary said he didn't feel any great appreciation for Norgay saving his life, as the New Zealand adventurer hurtled down a crevasse on a block of ice.
When Norgay tightened the rope that bound them, enabling Hillary to climb out of the sheer-walled ice chasm, Hillary said: ""Tenzing and I were a team. I expected Tenzing to carry out the right procedures in an emergency, just as I would.""
""Teamwork got Tenzing and me to the top of Everest,"" Hillary told an audience of mountaineers and school children, as the government handed out awards to Indian sportsmen in honor of Norgay, who was born in Nepal but was a resident of India for much of his life.
Hillary did not mention his claim - made in his autobiography published after Norgay's death in 1986 - that it was he, not his Sherpa guide and teammate, who had been the first to step onto the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit.
That claim has caused bad blood with Norgay's family, because during Norgay's lifetime, neither man would say who reached the summit first, insisting that it was a team effort.
But the ill feeling was not evident Tuesday as Norgay's son Jamling shook hands with Hillary on stage and listened to the New Zealand-born adventurer's praise of his father.
""Tenzing was a strong and brave man, a man of whom your country can well be proud,"" said Hillary, a former New Zealand high commissioner to India who stopped in New Delhi to commemorate the Everest climb.
Larger ceremonies are planned next week in Nepal, on the anniversary of the May 29, 1953 achievement.
Hillary told a rapt audience about how he almost died shortly before the Everest climb as he and Norgay headed up the dangerous icefall from base camp ""just to prove how fit we were.""
On the way back down from 6,400 meters (21,000 feet), the two men were trying to reach camp before dark.
Hillary recalled, ""We were roped together and I pounded down in the lead, when we reached another of the innumerable crevasses, very deep … and too wide to step across.""
A chunk of ice was attached to the wall of the crevasse, providing an extension point to cross. ""Without too much sense, I leapt into the air and landed with both feet on the chunk of ice,"" said Hillary. ""The chunk of ice broke off and fell down into the crevasse with me on it.""
Describing what seemed like an elevator ride down a tube of ice, Hillary said that, as time passed, he ""came to the conclusion that if Tenzing didn't tighten the rope soon,"" he and the chunk of ice would hit the bottom of the chasm and ""smash into smithereens.""
Just then, Hillary said, ""the rope came tight, and I swung into the ice wall. Then it was just a routine matter of cutting steps in the wall and climbing up.""

Charles Sobhraj, 59, was picked up at a casino in Katmandu about 4 a.m., police officer Keshav Badal said. He is expected to appear in court Monday.
Sobhraj, who earned his nickname for his talent at disguise and escape, is suspected of killing at least 20 people in India, Thailand, Afghanistan, Turkey, Nepal, Iran and Hong Kong between 1972 and 1982.
Police said they began searching for Sobhraj after a newspaper published photographs Wednesday of the alleged serial killer getting on a motorcycle in Nepal's capital.
The Himalayan Times said Sobhraj had been living at a hotel in Katmandu's tourist district for two weeks, trying to establish a pashmina shawl business.
Badal said police wanted to question him about the unsolved 1975 murders of two backpackers - Canadian Laddie du Parr and American Annabella Tremont - whose charred bodies were found on the city's outskirts.
After serving 21 years in prison in India for theft, Sobhraj was deported in 1997 to France, where he was investigated for allegedly trying to poison a group of French tourists in India.
He was born in Vietnam during French rule and claims French citizenship.
Sobhraj has admitted to killing young Western tourists. When he was released from the Indian prison, he said he regretted aspects of his past.
French actor-producer Yves Renier said Sobhraj lived in Paris for three years after being freed from prison in India.
Renier said Friday he started negotiating with Sobhraj about making a film based on a book about him. He said he saw Sobhraj ""about 30 times"" in Paris between 1997 and 2000.
Renier said that the movie deal was never completed, however, and that he gave up on the idea, which led Sobhraj to stop speaking to him.
""Around 2000, I was told Sobhraj had been living for a while in London,"" Renier said. ""But when he wants to hide, he just disappears from the face of the earth.""

"1075",20031749,"Title: URGENT Government soldiers kill 17 Maoist rebels in Nepal.rtf; Date: August 18, 2003 Monday; Text: Government soldiers killed 17 Maoist rebels in a gunbattle, even as the two sides were engaged in peace talks to end a seven-year insurgency, officials said Monday.
The soldiers were patrolling Sunday near the village of Doramba, 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Katmandu, when they were fired on by the guerrillas, the defense ministry said in a statement.
The rebels were killed in the gunbattle that followed, but there were no army casualties, it said.
Soldiers also recovered guns, ammunition and explosives from the site, the statement said.
There was no way to independently confirm either the details or the identity of those killed.
Word of the killings came on Monday just hours after government ministers Kamal Thapa and Prakash Chandra Lohani flew to the rebel stronghold of Hapure, nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Katmandu, and met with guerrilla leaders for 90 minutes.
The two ministers arrived eight hours late for the talks because monsoon rain delayed their flight. On Tuesday, both sides were scheduled to discuss a rebel demand for a new constitution, Thapa told reporters.
""The rebels have agreed to begin discussions on the main agenda from Tuesday,"" Thapa told reporters after returning to Nepalgunj, where the talks began on Sunday.
Thapa also said the government handed over a list of 233 people allegedly abducted by the rebels in the past few months and asked for their release or their whereabouts.
On Sunday, the guerrillas rejected a government proposal for an interim administration that would include rebels, and other reforms.
The rebels called the proposal disappointing, saying it failed to address many national issues.
They demand a special elected assembly that would draft a new constitution. They also want the assembly to decide if the king should continue as a constitutional monarch - or if the country should be turned into a communist state.
The government said it would not compromise or negotiate on the issue of Nepal's multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy, but was ready to make changes on everything else.
Despite the differences, Thapa said the government was optimistic that a solution would be found.
The rebels, who say they're inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a socialist state. The insurgency has killed around 7,000 people.
They declared a cease-fire in January and agreed to peace talks after the government stopped calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on their leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
The current round of talks is the third so far.

"5289",20066383,"Title: Child soldiers, bombs, vigilantes in Nepal raise concern.rtf; Date: March 17, 2006 Friday 9:07 AM GMT; Text: Rebel Maoist use of child soldiers, army bombing from helicopters and the rising number of state-sponsored vigilantes are major causes for concern in Nepal, a human rights group said Friday.
The rebels, who have been fighting to install a communist republic in Nepal for the past 10 years, have been forcibly recruiting child soldiers, said Sam Zarifi, Asia research director for Human Rights Watch.
During a three-week fact-finding tour of central and western Nepal, his team interviewed some 16 people who had been arrested after recent clashes, many of whom said they had been abducted and forced to join the ranks of the rebels.
Some had been rounded up in a ""one household, one person"" campaign where the rebels demand one person from every home in areas under their control, he said.
""The young people had been used as cooks, porters and medical personnel, but they had had military training and all were carrying grenades and socket bombs when they were picked up,"" Zarifi told a press conference in Kathmandu.
He also criticised the practice by the security forces, widely reported in the local media, of dropping mortars from helicopters during clashes between the army and Maoists.
""Too high a percentage of civilians are killed and injured,"" by the inaccurate weapons, Zarifi told journalists.
Some of the mortars fail to explode when they land, creating further dangers for those on the ground who may accidently trigger the unexploded ordnance.
The army has confirmed it drops bombs from helicopters but says it does this only in areas that are uninhabited.
""The Royal Nepalese Army has improvised a kind of bomb which is thrown from helicopters. We use that kind of bomb only in jungle areas,"" an army official said on condition of anonymity.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch also said the number of state-sanctioned anti-Maoist vigilante groups has been expanding in recent months.
""The vigilantes operate completely outside the law, and this situation places civilians more deeply in the path of danger,"" said Zarifi.
The rights group said that in many areas they visited, vigilante groups patrolled alongside soldiers.
Another rights group, Amnesty International, said in a statement last August that vigilante groups caused 31 deaths and the burning of 708 homes in a one-week period in Kapilvastu district alone last year.
The army official denied the military was involved in any way with organizing or arming the groups.
""We don't need vigilantes to fight,"" the official said.
Nepal's Maoists have been fighting their ""people's war"" in the impoverished Himalayan nation since 1996.
Recently they formed a loose alliance with opposition political parties sidelined when King Gyanendra sacked the government over a year ago and took direct control.
A road blockade of the capital, district headquarters and towns has crippled transport in the country for the past four days.

Parliamentarians have said that Maoist assault on the press has raised serous doubt about their commitment to a democratic system. They have demanded immediate action against the guilty.
Speaking in parliament on Sunday [21 December], parliamentarians of the ruling parties other than the Maoists as well as those from the opposition party condemned the attack on Himal Media.

Maoist trade union leader Shalikram Jamarkatel however said ""goons"" had been used to attack his party workers when discussions were being held over the expulsion of 16 workers by Himal.

Police said the rebels had severely stabbed the soldier, abducted from Bara district in the south of the insurgency-hit kingdom, but he might have lived if he had been taken to hospital.
The man who died in Baglung in western Nepal ""writhed in pain and requested water for six hours but no one dared to help him, fearing reprisals from the Maoists,"" a police official told AFP.
Human rights groups have accused the rebels, who have been battling since 1996 to install a communist republic, of various atrocities including kidnapping and killing civilians and torturing prisoners.
They have also accused soldiers fighting the insurgents of savage acts.
In other violence, rebels shot dead a social worker in the southern border town of Janakpur on Monday, police said. The motive for the killing was unknown.
Meanwhile, two boys, aged 12 and 14, died when they triggered a landmine as they ploughed a field in Chuchure village in the east of of Nepal, police said.
Such incidents are common in Nepal where there are many unexploded landmines that have been left behind by troops and rebels in old battlefields.

He called on ""all those committed to the people and the nation to make the maximum sacrifice and show understanding for a new political outlet by abandoning narrow party and group interests"". He said that the talks between Maoists and the Unified Marxist-Leninists was a positive beginning but was not enough. He added that ""an understanding and working relationship with Nepali Congress, a parliamentary force, is even more essential and necessary"". Following is the text of a commentary by leading Maoist Dr Baburam Bhattarai, headlined ""Maoist-UML talks are natural, will continue"", published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 30 November
 The recent talks between senior leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML have received attention at home and abroad. It is natural that the political meeting and discussion between the country's two prominent political forces during a grave political crisis should get such attention. It is also natural that different forces at home and abroad should interpret or misinterpret this political dialogue from their own standpoint and level of understanding.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 30 Nov 03 pp 1,2
First, it should be clear to all that the dialogue was conducted in a planned and more or less open manner while both sides were alert, and there is no need to take to view it with suspicion.
 Our party has accepted right from the beginning that there are three forces in the country and, for a permanent solution, we have proposed talks and dialogue between us, the king and parliamentary parties. During the last cease-fire and peace talks, we continuously met and had dialogue and talks with the old state monarchists on the one hand and the parliamentary parties standing between the old state and the new state i.e. the current and would-be systems .
 It is evident to all that for a new struggle our party has decided to continue talks and dialogue with all, and particularly with parliamentary parties fighting royal regression i.e. for the restoration of an elected government .
 Many foreign power centres with vested interests have incited militarists inside the country and created a situation where a political solution could not be found. It is only natural that this type of high-level talks should get prominence after our party's politburo meeting last month concluded that a bilateral struggle between the monarchy and the parties for a permanent solution was slowly emerging in place of a trilateral struggle between monarchy, parties and Maoists .
 The meeting decided to hold new talks with parliamentary parties. It is in this context that the first round of talks with the main opposition in the dissolved parliament, the UML, was held and it is our party's declared policy to hold similar talks with the Congress and other parties.
 As far as what transpired in the talks with the UML, the senior leaders of the two responsible parties, at a decisive and serious point in history, discussed all important issues that needed to be taken up.
 Rising above mean and narrow party interests, talks were held seriously for two days, centred on how to find an effective political outlet sought by the nation and people.
 During the meeting the two parties with different with separate strategies and programmes presented different views, which is natural. Even though both the sides have concentrated their efforts on finding a common meeting point among their differing action plans and towards giving a progressive way out to the country.
 Though confusion was created when some media, citing CPN-UML leader Madhav Nepal, published reports about the bilateral talks, we think that his 24 November interview in a national daily has made many things clear. Those are the main points of the bilateral talks. The UML put its points and so did the Maoists. On some points there was agreement, and on some there was disagreement.
 Among the much talked of Silguri talks in 2000 , the Kathmandu talks during the cease-fire and the recent talks, which I attended, I think the talks this time were more positive. And the result of the talks will depend upon the degree of similarity that Madhav Nepal will show in his words and action.
 And that also applies to our party and the leadership. On behalf of the party, what we want to assure everyone is that there has never been any difference between our words and action and this time and in future too it will be the same.
 And we are not surprised that these talks has troubled most the royal fascist elements and their henchmen. The target has been hit and it has troubled the right person.  As in the proverb when someone said ""cut off the thief's leg"", the thief has rem"

The changes, to be implemented over the next three years, will be instrumental in promoting rights and equality for women, said Shashi Kant Mainali, a top official in the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare.
The announcement comes a day after a female wing of Nepal's Maoist rebel movement called a general strike to mark International Women's Day and to protest the abuse of women in this Himalayan nation. Schools and businesses were closed across the country.
Though Nepal's constitution outlaws sexual discrimination, there are dozens of laws that disadvantage women, including on matters of property ownership, citizenship, marriage, employment and education.
The government will redraft each law that discriminates against women, Mainali said.
New laws will be enacted that require all political parties to nominate women as at least a third of their candidates in elections, from district level to national. They also will require all government departments to have a minimum of a third of their work force as women, Mainali said.
Details of the proposed laws were not released, including a timetable for their implementation.
Women currently make up about 8 percent of the government work force. The percentage of women in politics is not clear because Nepal's king suspended parliament in 2002 amid a dispute with the former government over its handling of a Maoist insurgency.
No date has been set for new elections or when parliament will resume.
New laws will also be passed to require the establishment of health clinics for women across the country, especially in rural areas where residents have little access to medical care.

 Minister for Health Dr Kyaw Myint delivered an opening address. He said: In Myanmar, the CCM Country Coordinating Mechanism was formed in March, 2002, with 19 members from organizations including UN agencies and NGOs non-governmental organizations , and later expanded to 29 members. The 29 members include nine from the Ministry of Health, one from the other related government ministries, nine from the NGOs and three from the private sector, one from HIV/TB/malaria patients group, four from the UN and two from religious/faith groups, he explained.
The New Light of Myanmar, Rangoon in English 13 Jan 04 pp 1, 8
Under the guidance of the State Peace and Development Council, the Ministry of Health is striving to raise the health standard of the nation and to ensure the highest attainable level of health for the entire nation by systematically developing and implementing health plans that will lead to achieving the ""Millennium Development Goals"".
 He continued to say that the existing health development plans are ""Myanmar Health Vision 2030"", ""Special Four-Year Plan for Promoting National Education (Health Sector)"", ""Rural Health Development Plan"", ""Project for Upgrading Hospitals"", and ""National Health Plan"". With these plans, the health care infrastructure of the country along with access to health care has been improved by the establishment of more health care facilities, and training and deployment of more health care professionals and workers.
 The ministry is also closely collaborating with UN agencies, local and international NGOs and other partners in the country as well. One of the outstanding achievements in disease prevention aspect for the year 2003 was the success achieved in the ""First Exhibition on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Activities"" at a national level that was held in Yangon during November 2003, he said.
 In 2003, Myanmar was able to declare itself free from leprosy and polio, indicating the success of an integrated and well-coordinated effort involving communities, NGOs, public and private sectors as well as international agencies. The commitment, enthusiasm, competency of health care providers and strong partnership among all the stakeholders were also major contributing factors.
 Provision of better health care services need more resources. In attempting to mobilize external resources to fill the resource gap, CCM Myanmar had submitted proposals to the Global Funds to fight AIDS, TB, malaria (GFATM) for the AIDS, TB and malaria. Proposal for the TB component was approved in the second round, malaria component in the third round and HIV component in the third round with subject to verification in January 2004, he said.
 One of the significant progresses during the past few months was that UNDP United Nations Development Programme was selected by the Global Fund Board to act as Principal Recipient (PR) for National TB Programme on receiving Global Funds.
 Myanmar has been collectively fighting against common health problems that occurred along the border areas with the aim to enhance better health collaboration and improve the health of the people in the border areas with emphasis on reduction of morbidity and mortality from Malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB, he elaborated.
 The Ministry of Health of Myanmar and the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand are also preparing to apply for the Global Funds to fight AIDS, TB and malaria along border areas. Preliminary meetings on development of a ""Joint Proposal for Myanmar-Thailand Cross Border Disease Control Programme"" were already conducted during 2003 in Bangkok and Yangon.
 Since the establishment of GFATM in last two years ago, our member countries from South-East Asia region have been submitting proposals to the GFATM board and many have been approved. This meeting will provide us with a very good opportunity to clarify certain modalities in handling GFATM funds and to exchange countries' experiences in implementing GFATM funded projects. It will also enable us to understand current situation"

In Manipur, the Kuki State Demand Committee has announced an 18-hour bandh from Thursday midnight for a 'Kukiland'
encompassing areas inhabited by Kuki tribal people of Manipur, Assam and adjoining states in the Northeast.
""Almost all communities have a state, council or self-rule territory. Why should the Kukis be deprived? Our stir will continue beyond this bandh,"" said the committee's publicity secretary LH Hmar.
A separate group of Kukis, however, have been demanding a new district to be carved out of Senapati district of Manipur. Senapati is inhabited by Kukis and Nagas, who have had a history of ethnic clashes, and the new district named Sadar Hills is expected to widen the chasm.
In Nagaland to the east, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration deal seems to have given a fresh lease of life to the demand for a separate Eastern Nagaland state comprising four districts - Mon, Tuensang, Kiphire and Longleng. Six Naga tribes inhabiting these districts have for long accused Nagaland government of being partial to 10 other tribes ""who control power and resources"".
The Neiphiu Rio government in Nagaland is against the statehood demand by the Eastern Naga Peoples' Organization, as is the rebel National Socialist Council of Nagaland that sees an 'Indian intelligence hand' in the 'divisive game'.
Another old statehood demand revived by the Gorkhaland deal is that of Garoland comprising the western half of Meghalaya inhabited by the Garo tribe.
But a relatively new demand is that of Gorkha Autonomous Council by the Nepalese-origin people of Assam. ""The Tarun Gogoi government did for the Gorkha Development Council, but it was a meaningless sop. We won't settle for anything less than an autonomous council (in north-central Assam),"" said All Assam Gorkha Students' Union publicity secretary Nanda Kirati Dewan.

""I am looking at viability from year one,"" Mallya said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in New Delhi.
The fledgling airliner plans to expand to 18 aircraft in 2005, 14 of which will be owned by the company, with the remaining four leased.
Kingfisher Air received permission to operate domestic air services from India's aviation regulator earlier this year.
Mallya, who is a member of parliament and also known as India's liquor baron, named the airline after the UB group's famous beer brand Kingfisher. 
Fashion models will serve as attendants aboard flights.
However, the group has said ticket prices will be lower than for other more established domestic carriers through tight control over costs such as issuing e-tickets, online reservations and outsourcing other services.
He said the airline will initially operate domestic services but added that the carrier could fly overseas if the government scraps a policy that allows only state-run carriers to fly on most international routes. 
Two private domestic airlines, Jet Airways and Sahara, fly to Sri Lanka and Nepal.
Indian Aviation Minister Praful Patel has already announced that the restriction on international flights for private carriers is expected to be lifted soon in order to boost air services to and from the country.

 Kathmandu, 26 November: A so-called battalion commander, a head of a self-styled local government, guerrillas, people's militia and central members of the Maoists have stated that the Maoists do not have the power any more to carry out big strikes nor seize a barracks.  All quoted below . This information was given to the security forces by persons earlier involved with the Maoist terrorist gangs who have now deserted it or have been arrested.
The Rising Nepal, Kathmandu, in English 27 Nov 03 p1
Giving the information that the Maoist guerrillas at present were concentrating on guerrilla warfare, they made it clear that even if they kill one or two soldiers through ambushes and landmines, they will not be able to achieve complete success over the army as a whole.
 Stating that the Maoists were attracting ignorant people towards them by giving cheap slogans and taking advantage of the unemployment, poverty and shortages in the country, they said that political disputes were also one of the reasons for the rise of terrorist activities.
 The arrested activists alleged that the Maoist leaders had taken special facilities, the higher-level commanders were buying land and houses by raising donations, lower level cadres were being exploited and given false assurances, and the brigade had been constituted only to raise the morale of activists. They said that the Maoists were indulging only in terrorist activities. The terrorist leaders are seeking to create rifts and splits, if possible attract the political parties towards them and if it is not, then ensure international support in their favour, it has also been stated.
 Says Laxmi Budhathoki of the so-called people's militia: ""They said that salary will be paid, jobs provided and girls given paternal property and this is the reason for joining them, but nothing happened there. They are eating and staying by force at the people's houses.""
 According to Yadav Bista, a so-called head of the people's government, there is ample possibility of rebellion among the Maoist group and if jobs and law and order are guaranteed, no cadre will stay with them.
 According to Maoist central member Kaji Budha, an old man from Chitwan, Rampur, Maoist leader Prachanda is fed up and extremely worried over the incidents in Nepal and this is the reason why he is smoking excessively and staring at nothing at times. He is worried over how to manage the affairs of the party.
 Budha says ""even if Prachanda wants to proceed with the dialogue, the faction of Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) does not want even to listen to such ideas. It is because of the ultras in the Badal faction that dialogue has not taken place further. A times, both the factions resort to low level allegations against each other.""
 ""I spent the important days of my life uselessly. Because of the internal bickering in the party, the future of any person is not safe in the party,"" said Jaya Bahadur Ghari of the so-called Mangelsen First Battalion. They have called upon all concerned to look for a safe future and not be involved in terrorist activities. Gharti, Bishta, Kaji Budha and Budhathoki have suffered injuries due to explosions of bombs and are undergoing treatment at the Birendra Military Hospital, Chhauni.

Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Puspakamal Dahal said in a statement the rebels extended the cease-fire.
Announced April 26, the initial rebel cease-fire expired Friday.
Nepal's seven-party government matched the rebel cease-fire with an indefinite truce that continues to hold.
On June 16, during their first summit-level meeting, government and rebel leaders signed an eight-point accord, pledging to translate the cease-fires into a ""permanent peace.""
But the accord has now run into rough weather after the political parties that form the government reneged on their pledge to dissolve the House of Representatives.
King Gyanendra revived the legislature amid growing popular protests in April to cede executive power to popular representatives.
The Maoists, who have no representation in parliament, want it dissolved, but party leaders and legislators have now set themselves against dissolution.
The June accord also provides for an interim government joined by the rebels, but this too has also been elusive because the insurgents refuse to disarm.
Disagreements have also overshadowed a planned second round of top-level talks, leaving them postponed.
""Our party has deep faith in the eight-point accord, and we believe the country can be transformed only by honestly implementing it,"" the Maoist chief, better known as Prachanda, said in his statement Friday.
The parties in parliament are showing signs of backing out from the accord under pressure from foreign powers, he added.
Prachanda said the rebels make ""a strong call"" for the government to ""carry forward"" the peace talks aimed at ending Nepal's decade-old armed conflict in accordance with the ""letter and spirit"" of the June accord.
""Otherwise, we will be forced to announce another peaceful popular revolt before the term of extended truce expires,"" Prachanda warned.

  I will make brief remarks, and then we will open it up for questions and answers. Let me start by saying how delighted I am to be back in India after an absence of several years. It is invigorating to feel the vibrancy of life in this country as it goes through rapid economic and social development. It is also heartwarming to be here at a time when peace is gradually breaking out in the region, with India and Pakistan making steady and truly remarkable progress in their bilateral dialogue, and India and China forging a strategic partnership that has the potential not only of uplifting the region but also to have a salutary effect on huge parts of the world.
 I came from Jakarta, where as you know an important summit took place, focusing on building renewed partnership between Africa and Asia. I hope as a result of that meeting that exchanges between the two continents will increase. It is countries like India that have a major contribution to making any effort to bring the peoples of these two continents together in the quest for a brighter and better future. India is an important member of the United Nations, and plays a very active role across the range of the Organization's work. A notable example is its longstanding and distinguished record in UN peacekeeping operations.
 During my stay here I had meetings with H.E. President Abdul Kalam, H.E. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, H.E. Natwar Singh, the Foreign Minister, External Affairs Minister as you say here, Excellency Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of the National Congress Party, and also with Mr. L.K. Advani, Leader of the Opposition.
 Among other issues we discussed, all aspects of my proposal for making the United Nations an effective multilateral instrument fit for the times and for future generations; the evolving regional situation in India's neighbourhood, with particular emphasis on relations between India and Pakistan and India and China, as well as the situation in Nepal; the post-tsunami relief and reconstruction efforts, and possibilities for cooperation between India and the United Nations disaster preparedness and response; as well as peacekeeping, terrorism, human rights, the situation in the Middle East, including Iraq and the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, and of course, the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. In addition, I chaired a roundtable discussion on HIV/AIDS yesterday, which gave me an opportunity to discuss critical issues like stigma and discrimination from the perspective of people infected with HIV/AIDS [who] are living with HIV.
 I am delighted that India supports many of the proposals I have made to enhance the effectiveness and relevance of the United Nations, and I am sure you will ask me to comment on India's aspiration for permanent Security Council membership. I believe many people, many nations around the world, consider India's aspirations legitimate, but as Secretary-General let me give you my comments here and now.
 The proposals for Security Council expansion that have been put to the membership consist of two options, known as Option A and Option B. Intense discussions are taking place among member states on these options. I cannot, as Secretary-General, have a preference for any of the options or express an opinion about which individual country or countries should be members of the Council. Almost every member state believes that the Council should be reformed and expanded so as to reflect the realities of today, and I hope that 2005 will be the year of decision.
 Let me pause here and take your questions.
 Question: My question relates to Nepal. I just want to get your views on the situation there, the recent arrests that have taken place in Kathmandu and in other places. What's your view on what can be done by the international community to pressure King Gyanendra to put democracy back on the rails in Nepal. And do you have a view on countries supplying or not supplying weapons to Nepal?
 Secretary-General: If I may ask you to ask one question each, because there are so many of you, so that I can take as many questions as possible. On the question of Nepal, I have been in touch with the King, and I also met him recently in Jakarta where we discussed the situation in Nepal. The United Nations and myself would want to see a return to constitutional rule as soon as possible, and I made this clear to the King. I think it is important that the political parties are allowed to resume their activities. From my discussions with the King, I hope this will happen. On the question of weapons and arms to Nepal, obviously individual countries have their own policies, but as the United Nations, we often discourage transfer of arms, or shipment of arms, into any area of conflict, because that will only exacerbate what goes on, but of course sometimes legitimate authorities need equipment a"

""It is very regrettable that they left without reaching an agreement,"" Nepal's ambassador-at-large Bhekh Bahadur Thapa told reporters.
He said the Bhutanese officials left Tuesday without informing the Nepalese government after two received minor injuries when the refugees attacked them with stones.
Thapa said Nepal would ask Bhutan to continue the talks on the sidelines of a January 4-6 South Asian summit in Pakistan.
Some 100,000 Bhutanese, mostly Hindus of Nepalese origin, have lived in seven camps in southeastern Nepal since 1990 when the Buddhist kingdom imposed cultural reforms encouraging the use of its language and national dress.
Bhutan denies any ""anti-Hindu"" agenda and has argued that most of the people left voluntarily.
But under criticism from the United States and European countries, Bhutan agreed in October to accept back the 12,183 residents of the Khudunabari camp. The other six camps are yet to be studied.
The Bhutanese team was Monday studying the status of 300 Khudunabari residents who were not included on the repatriation list.
The crowd threw stones Monday after a joint team from the two kingdoms told the 300 refugees they had to meet certain conditions for repatriation, including proof they were not involved in activities against Bhutan, a local official said.

Police said today besides arresting the suspected anti-national activists, small arms and other incriminating documents were recovered from them in a few cases. Last night, a Bangladeshi national, identified as Selim Uddin (20) of Cox Bazar area of Southern Bangladesh, was nabbed from a hotel in Agartala and Rs 8,500 and a tele-index book were recovered from his room, the sources added. 
Acting on a tip-off, East Agartala police stormed a hotel in Maharajganj Bazar of the city and arrested him, said DIG (Operation) Nepal Das, adding initially he claimed to be a resident of North Tripura but the references were found false. '' We are interrogating Selim now and initial investigation established he had some evil intention to cross the border without a valid passport and visa. His link with the Bangladesh based Harkat-Ul-Jihad-Islami (HUJI) terrorist outfit cannot be ruled out,'' Mr Das said. He said seven other Bangladeshi nationals were arrested from Pitra area in South Tripura on Sunday last, who had been lodging in a rented house for the past few months, concealing their identity. Three small arms and live ammunition were recovered from various locations of the state during the past week and one point 22 revolver was also recovered from Indo-Bangladesh border at Ramnagar yesterday, Mr Das added. He underscored that in the wake of possible militant strike, security measures in Tripura had already been tightened to ensure peaceful celebrations of Independence Day and the Quick Reaction Teams (QRT) were pressed into action in this regard. It was reported that a group of militants armed with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have entered into Sabroom in South Tripura district through Khagracherri (Bangladesh) border recently as the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) intensified operations against anti-Indian elements. According to intelligence sources, more groups were trying to sneak into Indian Territory from across the border and the BSF authorities were asked to maintain strict vigil along the international border in Sabroom subdivision. As in previous years, nine banned outfits of the northeastern region have reportedly called for a boycott of the Independence Day celebrations to protest Indian establishment. The militant organisations, active in Assam, Tripura, Manipur and Meghalaya, have called for a 17-hour general strike tomorrow.

 New Delhi, 21 November: The Indian defence establishment is scrambling to supply a third Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) to Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) after one of the two ALHs it recently delivered to its northern neighbour crashed in western Nepal about three weeks ago.
 One senior RNA officer was hurt when the ALH crashed at an undisclosed location in Lumbini zone on 28 October, according to a highly placed military source in New Delhi. The light helicopter was on a reconnaissance mission when it went down.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 22 Nov 04
News of that crash was not kept under wraps as New Delhi agreed to replace that chopper with a new one immediately. ""The chopper could be sent shortly before, or after the visit of RNA chief Gen Pyar Jung Thapa (who is scheduled to visit India in the last week of November),"" an officer said.
 India had delivered the two ALHs to Nepal on 12 June.
 Prior to the ALH, India had supplied Cheetah and Lancer helicopters to RNA. India has been providing military equipment and hardware to RNA at ""70:30 ratio"", meaning that Nepal is required to pay only 30 per cent of the cost price.
 RNA, whose strength is crossing 80,000 from just 45,000 four years ago, is said to be short of essential military equipment and weaponry to arm its rapidly growing forces that are taking on Maoist rebels.
 And, this is true of its ground troops, Special Forces - modelled after US Army's Ranger Battalion - and the air wing, popularly called the 11th Brigade.
 Aside from the Indian-made choppers, RNA boasts of aircraft like Mi-17, M28 Skytruck, Avro and Puma. Just recently, the UK - which provided two ""archaic"" MI-17 choppers - announced its plans to provide more ""non-lethal"" military assistance such as two Islander aircraft.

"58",2003481,"Title: British forces spokesman says life back to _normal_ in Basra after riots.rtf; Date: August 23, 2003, Saturday; Text: Text of report by Anwar Yasin published by Saudi newspaper Al-Watan web site on 12 August
 The British forces in Basra have announced the return of normal life following the incidents of the past two days and the confrontations between the citizens and the British forces.
 Capt Hisham Halawi, the official spokesman of the British forces in southern Iraq, has stated that calm had returned to the south (Basra, Al-Zubayr and Safwan).
 In a telephone interview with Al-Watan, Halawi added that about 25m litres of petrol were currently being distributed to petrol stations in Basra at market prices and not at the black-market prices which led to a petrol shortage in Basra.
Al-Watan web site, Abha, in Arabic 12 Aug 03
Halawi affirmed that the British forces, together with Iraqi police, would be deployed to ensure the fair distribution of petrol to everyone.
 The British forces spokesman denied that the British man killed in Basra was from the military, noting that he worked with a company which is carrying out economic projects in the south and was an employee of a private security company.
 Regarding the level of services, Halawi said that British engineers are working with Iraqi engineers to repair the main electricity networks in Safwan, Al-Zubayr and the centre of Basra, and that electricity will be restored soon.
 An Iraqi citizen and a Nepalese member of a security service working for the provisional authority of the American-British coalition in southern Iraq were killed in Basra on Sunday.
 The spokesman explained that some Nepalese elements, who formerly served in the British army, are currently working for private security companies in Iraq.
 Halawi ended his interview with Al-Watan saying that traffic has returned to the centre of the city, while British soldiers had taken up positions at petrol stations to regulate the distribution of petrol.
 British officials earlier stated that tribal leaders had talked to the angry residents to restore order in the second largest city in Iraq.

"4199",20054168,"Title: Outrage erupts over punishment for Nepal military custody death.rtf; Date: October 3, 2005 Monday 1:49 PM GMT; Text: The mother of a teenaged girl killed while in military custody in Nepal demanded Monday the soldiers responsible be tried in a civilian court after a military tribunal sentenced them to only six months in jail.
Devi Sunwar told reporters she hoped the soldiers, all officers, would be more severely punished under civilian law.
""I appeal to the government to give the appropriate punishment to the soldiers responsible for my daughter's murder,"" she said at a press conference organised by the Defend Human Rights Movement-Nepal.
Fifteen-year-old Maina Sunwar died while being interrogated by the army in 2004. Domestic media reports said she had been severely tortured, though the military said she was killed trying to escape detention.
A military court last month sentenced a colonel and two captains to six month in jail over the death.
Colonel Bobby Khatri was the highest-ranking army officer to be jailed for human rights abuses since the army was deployed in 2001 to fight Maoist guerrillas who want to topple the monarchy.
The court ruled the ""behavior shown"" by Khatri and Captains Sunil Adhikari and Amit Pun while interrogating the teenager violated her human rights, a military official said after the hearing, adding the officers had failed to follow ""proper procedure"".
The court ordered the colonel to pay 50,000 rupees (710 dollars) to the teenager's family and the captains each to pay 25,000 rupees. It told the government to pay 150,000 rupees in compensation.
But the punishment has done little to consol Maina's mother, who said:    ""If the soldiers guilty of murder can be set free after paying between 25,000 to 50,000 rupees, then I might as well commit the crime and be free by paying the money as a penalty"".
""If there is law in Nepal, I want the guilty army officials tried by a civilian court"", she said.
Defend Human Rights Movement-Nepal has demanded the officers be tried in a civilian court.
Earlier this month the UN official in charge of investigating torture allegations said Nepal's police and army systematically practised torture to extract confessions.
Manfred Nowak, UN special rapporteur on torture, said his findings were based on interviews with prisoners and ex-prisoners during a visit to Nepal.
The army has refuted the allegations.
The Maoists have been battling since 1996 to install a communist republic in the impoverished Himalayan kingdom. Over 12,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence.
Human rights groups accuse both the army and guerrillas of atrocities.

"1125",20032205,"Title: Maoist rebels in Nepal set conditions for third round of peace talks with government.rtf; Date: July 23, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Maoist rebels in Nepal on Wednesday demanded that the government set free their supporters, withdraw the army and disclose the whereabouts of their missing members before they'll join a third round of peace talks.
Replying to the government's invitation last weekend to resume the stalled talks aimed at ending the seven-year insurgency, the rebels said they want the government to honor earlier agreements.
The rebels say the government agreed during the second round of talks to order soldiers back to their bases. The government has denied making any such a commitment.
The army was deployed in November 2001 after the rebels pulled out of an earlier round of peace negotiations and resumed attacks on government and police targets across this Himalayan country.
In a statement faxed to news organizations Wednesday night, the rebel group's second-in-command Baburam Bhattarai warned that the government's failure to comply with the agreement would mean it was unilaterally breaking the cease-fire - and pushing the country back into civil war.
The third round of talks, planned for May, was delayed because of a change in government and differences over the withdrawal of government troops.
The rebels want an interim government and an assembly convened to draft a new constitution, saying the present one is too rigid and fails to address the people's needs.
The guerrillas, who say they're inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a socialist state. More than 7,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
The rebels declared a cease-fire in January and agreed to peace talks after the government stopped calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.

  According to Lumbini Development Authority, as compared to the previous year, there has been a steep rise in the number of tourists and pilgrims visiting Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha.
  The number of visitors has touched 70,000 mark compared to approximately 50,000 visitors recorded for 2006. 
  ""Lumbini is the place of peace of the world. This is called the world of the Buddhists. So, all the Buddhists and all other religious people come here. This pilgrimage tourism is important for the world,"" said Gin Giri, a historian.
  Lumbini is enlisted in the UNESCO's World's Heritage Site.
  ""This place is important because it is the birthplace of Lord Buddha who showed us how we can change ourselves, our own lives,"" said Nasko, an Australian Tourist.
  Tourist arrivals at Lumbini, which has always been a major cultural and pilgrimage centre for Buddhists across the globe, had earlier dropped sharply due to Maoist violence and political instability in the country.
  Maoists today say that they do not wish to harm foreign tourists, a key source of income for country known for its scenic beauty and boasts of having eight of the world's fourteen highest mountains including the Mount Everest.
  Lumbini, which exists as a pilgrimage centre, is situated about 350 kilometres (218 miles) from Kathmandu. It has been a major fascination for pilgrims from across the world including predominantly Buddhist countries of Japan, Burma, Hong Kong, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Philippines and Korea besides neighbouring India.
  Over 2,600 years ago, Buddha was born as a prince at Lumbini and went on to establish Buddhism. He attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya in India's Bihar State that borders the Himalayan country.
  Nepal has been trying to develop Lumbini as an international centre for pilgrimage and tourism.
  Religious groups from different countries are constructing monasteries or temple towers as part of the effort. Katmandu forms the base for visitors trekking the tranquil Himalayan mountains and its forested foothills or visiting the birthplace of Lord Buddha.
  Thousands of tourists spend hours sitting around its ancient temples and walking through its narrow lanes.

Authorities feared violence while the rebels marked the anniversary of the 1996 start of their violent campaign to replace Nepal's monarch with a communist state.
The fighting has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
The Home Ministry, which is in charge of the security, said ""the government has intensified security for the safety of the general public and to maintain law and order in the country.""
The capital Katmandu has suffered a series of bomb blasts in recent days, and authorities have found and defused other bombs. On Friday, soldiers patrolled the streets, checked vehicles for explosives and set up road blocks on routes to the army and police headquarters.
The government also has set up hot lines and urged people to report any suspicious activities.
Hundreds of vehicles lined up at Chipledunga, the entry point to Katmandu, where soldiers checked each passenger of each vehicle.
Violence has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August. The rebels, who say they are inspired by the late Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, walked out of peace talks and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.
The government offered an amnesty to guerrillas in December, guaranteeing security, rehabilitation, family reunions, cash aid, free education and medical treatment for those who surrender.
Government spokesman Gopendra Pandey said a deadline for the amnesty has been extended to April 13.
He said 344 rebels have so far surrendered and denounced violence.

    On Wednesday afternoon, CNP officials found a carcass of a  pregnant rhino with a stillborn calf in the national park, some 85  km southwest of Nepali capital Kathmandu. The rhino had been shot  two days ago. It had its horn missing, officials said. 
    Ten rhinos including this one have been killed since the rhino  census in March 2008, according to Department of National Parks  and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC). There were 408 rhinos in CNP in  March 2008. Since then, six more have died natural deaths. 
    A month back, a rhino which had been shot and had its horn  missing died in Chitwan. Rhino horn is believed to have aphrodi-  siac properties and costs as much as 2.4 million Nepali rupees (  some 30,000 U.S. dollars). 
    Two rhinos have been poached inside Bardiya National Park, some  390 km west of Kathmandu, in the past few months. 
    ""We have resources to mobilize rhino conservation efforts  inside the park,"" says Narendra Babu Pradhan, chief conservation  officer of CNP, ""But we have not been able to identify the  poachers."" 
    There are more than 1,000 security personnel, excluding park  authorities, deployed in 42 security posts inside CNP spread over  938 square kilometers. ""The CNP covers a huge area and we can't  monitor all parts. This has made it easy for poachers,"" he says.  Poachers are also using modern weapons, he adds. 
    Mangal Man Shakya, a wildlife expert, blames lack of  enforcement of  punishment for the rise in poa-ching activities. ""  Poachers are not afraid of punishment because they get bail soon  after arrest,"" he said. 
    The National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 states  that killing a rhino is punishable with a fine of 50,000 rupees or  100,000 rupees (some 1,250 U.S. dollars) or imprisonment of five  or 15 years or both. ""Rewards outweigh punishment,"" says Shakya.

 Excerpt from report by Milan Mani Sharma, published by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 11 July
 Kathmandu, 10 July: With an aim to reduce export dependency on India and diversify export markets, the government is all set to formally approach China for duty free market access and other trade facilities to Nepali exports to China, including the Autonomous Region of Tibet.
 ""A formal discussion on the issues will be held shortly with the government and officials concerned at the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu,"" said a government source, further stating that it is expected to pave ways for talks at the appropriate level, including political level.
 This is regarded as a major breakthrough, as the concerned traders and experts had long been urging the government to seek tariff concessions from China to provide impetus to Nepal's trade with its northern neighbour.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 11 Jul 03
To date, the issue was discussed at informal level only. ""Nonetheless, China has been maintaining a positive tone on the matter,"" said the source. A Chinese embassy official concerned with the initiative, while talking to The Kathmandu Post recently, also expressed similar views.
 ""China is ready to enter into a new arrangement to boost trade with Nepal. But it can be worked out only when Nepal formally approaches the concerned Chinese authorities for discussing the issues at the appropriate level,"" said Qiang He, third secretary, economic and commercial office, Chinese embassy.
 China has been liberal to promote bilateral trade of late. Apart from the existing four functional trade points, China is for opening four more customs checkpoints with Nepal. In addition, the northern neighbour has also shown eagerness in developing necessary infrastructures to link the two countries.
 The government official also expressed optimism that China would pledge zero tariff facility to maintain strategic balance, as Nepal has been enjoying similar trade arrangement with India.
 Nepal has bilateral trade agreement with China since 1981. The treaty is being automatically renewed every three years with no proposal for reviewing coming from either governments. In fact, the two governments have never sat down together and assessed its impacts since the time of signing the bilateral treaty.
 However, Nepal has been short in registering significant trade with China while inflow of Chinese goods has soared drastically over the years, to the effect that Nepal has experienced a trade deficit of over 8bn rupees with China in 2002 alone.
 ""With China providing duty-free market access, Nepali products would capture Tibetan and other markets in China, thereby helping reduce the widening trade gap,"" said Pradeep Kumar Shrestha, former president of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).  passage omitted

Thousands of people are expected to attend the rally for King Gyanendra at a stadium in Pokhara on Sunday.
Some residents will have the opportunity to pay their respects to the monarch who will later address the crowd.
Though Maoist rebels have not directly threatened to disrupt the reception, they have called for a two-day general strike in the region, beginning Saturday, apparently to prevent people from traveling to Pokhara, nearly 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.
But officials were adamant that suitable security arrangements had been made.
""The strike is not going to hamper the rally,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters on Saturday.
""Adequate security arrangements have been made to ensure the safety of the participants,"" said Laxya Bahadur Gurung, who organized the rally.
Troops set up road blocks and checked vehicles while residents shut businesses and stayed at home on Saturday.
Authorities were not taking any chances since a massive rebel attack at Beni, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Pokhara, that killed scores of soldiers, civilians and guerrillas last weekend.
Fighting between the rebels and government soldiers has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last August after three rounds of peace talks.

"1505",20044016,"Title: Rebels in Nepal Kill Policeman As the Capital Endures a Siege.rtf; Date: August 22, 2004 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Suspected insurgents shot dead a policeman on Saturday in Katmandu, Nepal's capital, as the military said it could escort food shipments into the city to ease a blockade inspired by antigovernment guerrillas. 
 The shooting came on the fourth day of the blockade as the Maoist guerrillas failed to respond to a government offer to meet some of their demands for lifting the blockade. The siege has led to fuel rationing and has pushed up food prices in this city of 1.5 million people.
 The blockade is the latest tactic by the guerrillas, who have been waging a rebellion to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a Communist republic. More than 10,000 people have died in the revolt, now in its eighth year.
 The rebels have not set physical barriers to block trucks carrying supplies to the capital but are enforcing it mainly through fear of their trademark hit-and-run attacks.
 The capital itself is well guarded, but the rebels have repeatedly shown their ability to bomb buildings and carry out targeted killings in Katmandu since the revolt began.
 A Home Ministry official said two men on a motorcycle shot the policeman as he was walking in a residential area on the outskirts of the city.
 ''He died on the way to hospital,'' the official said. ''We believe the killers are Maoists.'' 
 Two people were wounded on Friday when suspected rebels set off two bombs in the city. Those attacks and Saturday's shooting are thought to be efforts by the guerrillas to scare Katmandu residents and reinforce the siege.
 The government plan to use armed escorts to protect supplies being shipped to the capital was developed to prevent scarcities and panic buying in the capital, which is also a popular tourist center.
 ''If necessary, we will bring in essential goods in trucks escorted by the army,'' said Dinesh Chandra Pyakurel, the most senior bureaucrat in the Supply Ministry. ''But that situation has not come yet.''
 Katmandu had stocks of gasoline to last 10 days, diesel for 30 days and kerosene, used by the poor for cooking and heating, for three weeks.
 Mr. Pyakurel said stocks of food supplies, mainly distributed by private business, could last a month. 
 ''There is no situation for panic yet,'' he said.
 Kanchi Rokka, a Katmandu homemaker, urged the government to take the lead and hold talks with the rebels to end the crisis.
 ''The government should accept mediation if the Maoists want to resume talks and solve the problem,'' she said. ''How long should we suffer?'' 
 The government and the rebels say they are committed to peace talks but neither side has taken the lead to resume efforts to reach a peace agreement. Negotiations broke down last year.
 The rebels want talks to be brokered by the United Nations, but the government says it does not want outside involvement.
 The rebels called the blockade to press their demands for investigations into allegations of killings of Maoists, the release of jailed comrades and information about missing guerrillas.
 The government promised on Friday to provide information about leaders of student groups and trade unions linked to the Maoists, who the rebels say have disappeared in the kingdom's civil war.

 Kathmandu, 24 May: In the wake of escalating rights violations, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is all set to issue a ""code of conduct"" to the Maoists, who will be required to implement it if they are to prove themselves as a ""political"" force.
 Sushil Pyakurel, member of the NHRC, told the Post today that the commission's forthcoming move is aimed at implementing the government's 25-point commitment paper on human rights of 26 March 2004.

""The code of conduct outlines the minimum steps the Maoists need to take up to become a political force,"" Pyakurel said, hinting that the code could be announced ""very soon"". It is for the first time that the NHRC has formally issued such a code for the Maoists.
 Pyakurel also informed that the 10-page ""code of conduct"" is based on Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. ""Our stress is to implement the international humanitarian law, including all international laws that espouse the protection of human rights,"" he said.
 ""It is high time the NHRC asked the Maoists to draw a demarcation line as to whether they want to remain an armed political force or a terrorist force,"" Pyakurel said. ""The Maoists' activities, following the issuance of the code of conduct, will prove their stance.""
 The ""code of conduct"" entitled ""minimum steps the Maoists should take in order to implement the international humanitarian law and other international laws"", has urged the Maoists to immediately stop extra-judicial killings, among other atrocities.

"2606",20043246,"Title: Tracking down Nepal 's communist rebels in a land of timeless beauty and uncertain reality_1.rtf; Date: July 3, 2004, Saturday, BC cycle; Text: A trek deep into this Himalayan kingdom is a bit like stepping into Alice's rabbit hole and stumbling along a path that takes you to a land of physical grandeur, hard poverty and the slow rhythms of an ancient way of life - but one that exists alongside the modern clash of political ideology.
My colleague Ami and I - both photojournalists - decided to take Nepal's Maoist rebels up on a general invitation for outsiders to visit areas where they have pushed out government control in a war that has caused more than 9,000 deaths since 1996.
When just about everyone else has given up on communism, it's flourishing in parts of Nepal. Rebels are setting up farm cooperatives, rewriting school curriculums and following other programs once espoused by Mao Zedong for rural China - a proletariat dream that has been swept away by the Chinese embrace of capitalism.
After several days of trying to snag seats on a flight into Nepal's heartland, we opted to make a 15-hour drive west from Katmandu, the capital, to the town of Nepalganj and grab a plane there.
We stopped to pick up our fixer, a local journalist named Rudra. He came with color TV, desktop computer and some smaller electronic items. He smiled and climbed aboard the rented Indian-made jeep; rides are hard to come by and he wasn't about to pass up a chance to carry these modern conveniences to his family.
After a grueling drive, during which we had to occasionally push the jeep along the bumpy road, we caught a twin-prop Royal Nepal airliner that took us from the heat of Nepalganj into the mountainous district of Rukum, where the Maoists have created a state of their own.
As we got off, dozens of people carrying bundles swarmed the plane, elbowing to grab seats and leave the barbed wire-enclosed 1 1/2 square miles that is the only government-controlled area in the district.
We passed through a military checkpoint, and started to walk up into the hills against a backdrop of soaring mountains.
We were never alone. One or two people always attached themselves to us. They wanted to know where we were from, where we were going and what we wanted to see. Some asked Ami and I - both in our 30s - if we were teenagers, since our skin has been spared the weathering that marks people living high in the mountains.
Others, when they found out I am Mexican, were curious about the Zapatista rebels who have carved out an enclave in the jungles of Mexico's southernmost state, Chiapas.
Rudra warned us that some, if not all, the questioners were spies, but figuring out who was a government informant, who was a Maoist agent and who was just a curious villager was nearly impossible.
Four hours of walking brought us to our first stop, the village of Chhiban, where Rudra was born.
Climbing over a hill - the last one Rudra promised us and our aching legs - we crossed into a valley of wheat fields surrounding clusters of four or five red-adobe houses with thatch roofs, many of them two stories. Each had a corral or barn for water buffalo, goats, chickens and the occasional horse and a small circle out front for threshing wheat. Some had berry bushes to supplement diets.
With the light from the setting sun turning golden, we were greeted by Rudra's extended family at the narrow river that waters the valley. Children crossed over with little brothers and sisters tightly strapped to their backs, hopping across a plank of wood like lithe tightrope walkers.
Life in this part of the world comes with few creature comforts. We spent the night cuddled on a board in a room next to a home's grain storage room, sharing our space with a variety of bedbugs.
In the morning, Ami, Rudra and I set off on a three-day trek to look for the leaders of the rebels, whose contact name we got from some teachers who had been kidnapped by Maoists and later let go.
We met contacts who led us to new contacts. We were questioned by junior Maoists, and by senior Maoists.
They spoke enthusiastically of their movement's drive to create a new world, ""a money-less state where crime will be uprooted by the abolishment of the class system.""
While insisting they are non-dogmatic, officers said education must be revamped and teachers re-educated.
They also talked of the need for compulsory military training. ""It's a time of war. That is why all of the people need to take army training, be it teachers or businessmen,"" one said.
We also got to talk with civilians, some who support the rebels and some who seem to have doubts.
While staying at the home of a pregnant woman, she asked, ""Why have you been kidnapped?"" Told that we were there on our own, she looked puzzled, then shook her head. Later we learned her husband had been taken away by the rebels 11 days earlier because he didn't want to be a part of the movement any longer.
In the town of Nepalganj, we visited a small orphanage for 52 girls and boys, ages 3 to 16, who have lost their parents to the troops of one side or the other. Boys kicked around a s"
"4368",2006750,"Title: Lost 'passport' proves Tibet 's independence_ exiles.rtf; Date: January 15, 2006 Sunday 2:29 AM GMT; Text: A passport issued to a Tibetan official before Chinese forces occupied the region in 1950 has been found in Nepal and provides proof of Tibet's former independence, a Tibetan exile group has said.
The passport was issued by the Tibetan government in 1947, Tenzin Tsundue, general secretary of the Friends of Tibet group, said in a statement.
He told AFP the group knew of no other Tibetan passport that had survived.
The passport -- a large sheet of traditional Tibetan paper -- was given to then Tibetan Finance Secretary Tsepong Wangchuk Dedhen Shakabpa, who was leading a trade delegation to China, the United States and Britain, it said.
""This document stands as an important proof of the independent status of Tibet, legally recognised by other countries before China's invasion of Tibet,"" he said.
Tsundue said the document had visas issued by a slew of nations such as the United Sates, Britain, India, France, Italy, Switzerland and Egypt.
The passport contains in the centre the Tibetan government seal surrounded by seals of different governments that issued visas to the official, he said.
China says its occupation of Tibet liberated it from feudal oppression.
But Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama who fled Tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising against China's rule and now lives in exile in northern India says Tibet's six million people still suffer repression.
Beijing formally established a Tibetan Autonomous Region in 1965 but the Dalai Lama complains there is no genuine autonomy and has been waging a peaceful campaign to press China to provide greater rights to Tibetans.
The passport had been given by Shakabpa to an Indian friend in 1992 and ended up with an antique dealer in Kathmandu, said Tsundue. It was not known how it found its way into the antique dealer's hands.
It was bought back for 10,000 dollars using money borrowed from a Tibetan monastery in 2004.
Tsundue said some 850 Tibetans -- living in exile in India and Nepal -- contributed donations to repay the monastery. After the target was met, ""we decided to inform the people of the recovery of the passport,"" he said.
The group plans to include the passport in an exhibition ""Story of a Nation: Independent, Occupied and Exiled Tibet,"" in India this year aimed at proving Tibet's former independent status, Tsundue said.
While the Dalai Lama has dropped a call for Tibetan independence, Tsundue said that objects showing it once was independent would ""add more weight"" to the spiritual leader's push for greater autonomy for the region.
Articles that will be on display include ""postage stamps of independent Tibet, Tibetan currency -- notes and silver coins -- (and) old photographs of the Tibetan army,"" taken in the 1920s, Tsundue said.

About 1.6 million people have fled their homes in India, while tens of thousands of others have abandoned their houses in neighboring Bangladesh and Nepal because of rising waters.
Waterborne disease, electrocution, collapsing buildings, and strong currents have caused most of the deaths.
In Nepal, six people drowned Sunday when they were swept away by a flooded river in Handikhola village, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of the capital Katmandu, police said. Four more remained missing and police said they were presumed to have drowned.
At least a dozen others were swept away by flooded rivers on Saturday and were presumed dead.
Another four people died when a landslide buried a half dozen houses in the village of Ramechap, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Katmandu, but villagers managed to pull a boy alive from the rubble, police said.
Landslides also blocked two main roads, cutting the capital off from the rest of this Himalayan kingdom, police said.
In eastern India, seven people were swept away and were feared drowned by the flooding Bagmati River.
About 1,240 villages have been inundated in eastern Bihar state, said Sitamarhi district magistrate A.B.P Sinha. Military personnel in helicopters and boats rescued stranded victims while dropping food packages.
Thousands of homes and buildings on the large Majuli island - on Brahmaputra River in Assam state - have flooded since Friday and residents have taken shelter in tents on higher ground, said Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, deputy inspector general of police.
The flooding also threatened 20 monasteries established by a 17th century Hindu philosopher, Mahanta said.
In Bangladesh, six people, including four children, drowned as relief workers scrambled to get supplies to tens of thousands of victims in need, officials said Sunday.
Floods have engulfed about a third of Bangladesh, marooning tens of thousands of people since monsoon rains started late last month. Thousands have been rendered homeless and forced to flee inundated areas.
Relief workers ferried food and drinking water to many flood victims, but they said more aid was needed.
Many villagers were stranded on the roofs of their submerged homes, while others were living in boats. Submerged wells have forced residents to drink flood water, exposing them to diseases, officials said.

Pradeep Giri and Bimalendra Nidhi of the Nepali Congress Democratic party were freed by the court nearly two months after they were arrested in a government crackdown on rival politicians and activists.
The Supreme Court has freed several detained politicians in recent weeks in a blow to the royal government, which has continued to crack down on the opposition.
Giri and Nidhi had filed a petition with the court soon after being arrested on Jan. 19 during night raids on their homes.
The court ruled that the government had no grounds to hold them.
About 100 supporters welcomed the freed politicians with bouquets of flowers and garlands and smeared them with red powder, a Nepalese custom for celebrations.
Giri and Nidhi were among hundreds of politicians and activists arrested by the government to block opposition plans for a massive rally in Katmandu on Jan. 20 calling on King Gyanendra to restore democracy.
The king seized control of the government last year, saying he needed to do so to quell a communist insurgency and fight corruption.
His plans to hold municipal elections last month were marred by rebel violence and a boycott by the main political parties, which said it was an attempt by the king to legitimize his rule.

 Mohasin There is no question about us abandoning the way to peace or the peace talks. At the same time, we cannot wait indefinitely for that. The country is devoid of people's representatives today. There is no institution today, for three years now, where people have sent their representatives to man the posts. The constitutional rights of the sovereign people cannot be disallowed to choose their representatives for too long. We have been calling on the Maoists for talks time and again. We have said that we will be flexible and discuss every issue they have raised. But still, if their arrogance, arising out of being armed, does not allow them to contact us, we will not want to wait indefinitely. In the coming days, we will first take steps to create the environment for the people to use their sovereign rights.

 Chautara, 27 June: The Maoists today called off their indefinite strike imposed at Tatopani customs point, the only overland route linking Nepal with China. The imports and exports via this point had come to a standstill for the last three weeks after the rebels called an indefinite strike and also pressurized the businessmen not to pay any kind of taxes to the government.

"6397",20072513,"Title: Nepal to End Its Monarchy In a Deal With Ex-Rebels.rtf; Date: December 24, 2007 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Nepal's government agreed Sunday to abolish the centuries-old monarchy in a political deal with Maoist former rebels, but the decision will go into effect only after next year's elections, party officials said.
  Three months ago, the anti-monarchy Maoists, who ended their decade-long civil war last year, left the government. They were demanding an immediate declaration of a republic, a step that indefinitely delayed a constituent assembly election that had been set for November.
That election, Nepal's first national vote since 1999, was intended to map the country's political future, including that of the monarchy, and was expected to cap the landmark 2006 peace agreement that ended a conflict that caused 13,000 deaths.
  Government leaders met with the former rebel chief, known by his nom de guerre, Prachanda, but whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to break the deadlock.
  ''Nepal will be a Federal Democratic Republic nation,'' the six-party governing alliance and the Maoists said in a statement. ''And the decision will be implemented after the first meeting of the constituent assembly.''
  ''But if the king creates serious hurdles to the constituent assembly elections,'' the statement added, a two-thirds majority of the interim Parliament ''can remove the monarchy even before the polls.'' 
  The popularity of King Gyanendra plunged when he ousted the government and assumed absolute powers in 2005, only to yield control after weeks of protest last year. The monarch has traditionally been viewed in Nepal as an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.
  The twice-delayed elections will now be held within the Nepali year, which ends on April 12, and the Maoists will rejoin the government, said Arjun Narsingh K. C., a spokesman for the Nepali Congress Party, the country's biggest political party. 
  Thousands of Maoist former fighters have been confined to United Nations-monitored camps since last year after the government agreed to hold the elections. The government will also begin the process of integrating the former fighters and pay their wages regularly, the statement said.
  In return, the Maoists will hand back the property and land seized during the conflict. But mainstream political parties say the Maoists are still extorting money and intimidating political workers.

"6577",20083957,"Title: Lawmakers in Nepal abolish the monarchy.rtf; Date: May 28, 2008 Wednesday 8:10 PM GMT; Text: The world's last Hindu kingdom became its newest secular republic Wednesday as Nepal's lawmakers, led by former communist insurgents, abolished the monarchy that had reigned over this Himalayan land for 239 years.
Throughout the day, thousands of people marched, danced and sang in the streets of Katmandu in anticipation of the vote, waving red hammer-and-sickle flags as dour King Gyanendra awaited his fate in the pink concrete palace that dominates the city's center.
He finally found out the fate of his throne late in the day when, as expected, the newly elected Constituent Assembly declared the country a republic and abolished the monarchy by a vote of 560-4. The assembly's 37 other members were not present.
""We have entered a new era today,"" said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, calling Nepal's rebirth as a republic ""the dream of the whole nation.""
There was no immediate reaction from the 61-year-old king, who has remained silent in recent months as it became apparent that his days on the throne were numbered.
He now has 15 days to quit the 1970s-era palace and move to his large private residence in the city or face the possibility of being removed by force.
As word of the republic's declaration spread through Katmandu, groups of celebrating young men yelled in the streets and set off firecrackers.
""The people in Nepal have defeated the autocrat Gyanendra,"" said Gopal Thapa, a 23-year-old supporter of the Maoists, the former rebels. ""Nepal is now the people's republic.""
All around him, a crowd celebrating outside the convention center, where the vote was held, chanted ""Long live the republic!"" and denounced Gyanendra as a thief.
Not since the Shah of Iran was deposed in the bloody 1979 Islamic revolution has one of the world's monarchs been forced from his throne.
But while the end of Nepal's royal dynasty may have come in a peaceful vote, the stage for the monarchy's demise was set by a communist insurgency that bled Nepal for a decade, and a 2001 palace massacre in which a gunman, allegedly the crown prince, assassinated King Birendra and much of the royal family before killing himself.
Gyanendra then assumed the throne. But the killings helped pierce the mystique surrounding a line of kings who had once been revered as reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu, and Gyanendra was dogged by rumors that he was somehow involved in the massacre.
His 2005 seizure of power from a civilian government only made matters worse. He said he needed total authority to crush the Maoists, but he quickly began locking up peaceful opponents and found himself beset by an intensifying insurgency and a faltering economy.
A year later, weeks of massive protests forced Gyanendra to restore democracy, after which the Maoists came out of the bush and began peace talks.
An interim government, meanwhile, slowly stripped away the trappings of a kingdom. Gyanendra lost command of the army, his portrait was replace by Mount Everest on the currency, the word ""royal"" removed from the name of the national airline, and references to the king were dropped from the national anthem.
Gyanendra, who is believed to be personally wealthy with interests in tourism, tea and tobacco, also endured other indignities. His $3.1 million annual allowance was taken away, as were the queen's beauticians and about half his ceremonial guard.
Then came April's vote for the assembly in which the fiercely republican Maoists won the most seats, all but sealing the fate of the dynasty, which dates to 1769 when a regional ruler conquered Katmandu and united Nepal.
With the king now gone, Nepalis are settling in for a three-day public holiday. But what comes next remains uncertain.
While the Maoists say they are committed capitalists and have no intention of nationalizing industries or setting up collective farms, they have promised to bring sweeping change to this largely impoverished country that in many place more closely resembles medieval Europe than a modern nation.
But they are struggling to form a government Wednesday's opening assembly session was delayed for hours while they wrangled with other political parties over who should be president and what powers he should have. At the end of the day, they still did not have a deal.
Nepal also is still regularly bloodied by political violence, as evidenced by a string of small bombings that hit Katmandu this week, including two on Wednesday.
None of the bombs which appeared to have been aimed at pro-republic politicians and activists caused any serious injuries. But they underscored how difficult it will be to fashion lasting peace in Nepal, where supporters of every major political party have been linked to killings since the start of the peace process.
And even in victory, the Maoists worry many in Nepal. They still have 20,000 fighters in U.N.-monitored camps spread across the country and their former fighters were recently implicated in the abduction and murder of a Katmandu busines"
"236",20032746,"Title: Heavy snowfall on Mount Everest keeps hundreds of climbers at base camp.rtf; Date: May 2, 2003, Friday, BC cycle; Text: Snow storms on Mount Everest have stranded hundreds of climbers at their base camp as a record number of people try to scale the world's highest peak, Nepalese tourism officials said Friday.
Crowds of climbers hope to reach the summit to mark the 50th anniversary of the Himalayan peak's conquest.
On May 29, 1953, New Zealander Edmund Hillary and a Nepalese guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first to stand atop the mountain.
The stranded mountaineers and their Nepalese Sherpa guides and porters have been waiting for the weather to clear, sitting in their tents at the camp some 17,400 feet above sea level.
""We have reports … that it has been snowing for the past few days, and most climbers have retreated back to the base camp due to the deteriorating weather,"" said Tourism Ministry official Gyanendra Dhakal.
Nepal meteorologists said the weather was not expected to change over the weekend.
The Nepalese government already has issued climbing permits to 22 teams with a dozen members each, plus Sherpas who help carry gear up the icy slopes.
The first batch of climbers is expected to attempt the ascent around the second week of May, when the weather is usually better.
Thousands have poured into Nepal since 1953 to try climbing 29,030-foot high Mount Everest, or simply to glimpse the Himalayan peaks from the window of an airplane. Over 1,200 have reached the summit, while nearly 200 have died on its slopes.
To mark the golden jubilee, veteran mountaineers are expected to fly to Nepal at the end of this month. They include Hillary and Junko Tabei, the first woman to set foot on the summit in 1975.

The rebel combatants were confined to camps monitored by the United Nations after they ended their decade-long insurgency in 2006 as part of a peace deal. They have been interviewed by U.N. arms monitors and are waiting to either be integrated into the national security forces or resettled back into society.
A special committee was formed by the government last week to resolve the issue of the ex-fighters, but the main opposition political party has refused to join the group unless it is given a greater role.
""I urge to all political leaders and all government leaders that they should be able to work with the spirit of cooperation and compromise and also flexibility,"" Ban said Saturday. ""They should work for national unity.""
Ban met with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, President Ram Baran Yadav and several other officials, including members of the Constituent Assembly elected in May to rewrite the constitution and govern the Himalayan nation.
The former rebels contested that election and emerged as the country's largest political party. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the former leader of the rebels, heads the coalition government.
Ban also met leaders from the opposition Nepali Congress party.

""Nils Antezana, 69, of the US and a doctor by profession, died on May 18 at an altitude of 8,600 metres (28,214 feet) on his way back to base camp from the summit of Everest,"" the tourism ministry said in a statement.
Antezana had been one of four members of the International Everest Expedition Spring 2004 who had reached the summit, it said.

The ministry did not say how did Antezana had died or why it had taken a week for his death to be announced.
Bulgarian state radio had earlier reported that Bulgarian mountaineer Christo Christov was found dead Monday just below the summit, which he had reached four days earlier.
Christov, 26, had reached the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) summit by the north face, without oxygen, two Sherpa guides said.
He had been missing since Thursday, when his expedition started down due to bad weather.
Last Friday, Tokyo-based tour company Adventures Guide said 63-year-old Japanese Shoko Ota died after becoming the second-oldest woman to conquer Everest.
It said Ota fell unconscious Thursday 350 metres (1,150 feet) from the top after a fall broken by her safety rope and her team leader later said she had died.

According to victims, the group has been extorting money from local villagers, blaming them for giving food and shelter to the Maoists in the past. ""You are Maoists and we have your names on our list. We will remove your name from the list if you give us money, otherwise you will face action,"" the victims quoted the retaliation committee members as saying.
The group has been extorting money from villagers in Karouta, Yumuwa and Piprawa villages among others. The group demands money ranging between 10,000 -15,000 rupees. [passage omitted: The group has been extorting money from families whose members work abroad]
A source claimed that the group has protection from the police and administration and most of the members live in India, while few members, including the chairman, live in Nepal. But police denied having provided protection to the group. The group had told an Indian daily newspaper that police have provided it modern weapons.
Political parties have criticized the police and administration for giving protection to irresponsible people in the name of a Maoist retaliation committee.

 New Delhi, 5 November: Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that the Maoists in Nepal are trying to develop a link with India's Naxalites. He said that he had taken the matter seriously.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 6 Nov 04, p 1
Addressing the closing of a three-day meeting of the police chiefs from different Indian states on Friday 5 November , he expressed concerns over the rising leftist extremism and the violence it has ignited. ""Fighting the leftist extremism alone is not the ultimate goal,"" he said. ""The violence it has triggered is the central challenge for law and order.""
 Prime Minister Singh revealed that the Nepalese Maoists were trying to establish links with the Naxalites in different parts of India. The meeting of the police chiefs was held to face possible national security challenges posed by such Naxalite groups within and outside the country.
 The annual report published Friday by the Indian Ministry of Defence also states that Nepal's Maoists are threats to India's internal security. ""The increasing activities of the Maoists in Nepal's terai plain areas bordering with India are a matter of serious concern,"" the report states. The meeting of the police chiefs has also accepted that the rising activities of the Maoists is a challenge to the whole South Asia region.
 Meanwhile, Nepalese Ambassador to India Karnadhwoj Adhikari has said that India's assistance is vital to Nepal at a time when the Maoists are trying to establish links with other rebel outfits of South Asia. He advised an objective assessment of the situation when speaking on Nepal-India issues. ""No journalists and political analysts should express sensational views that negatively affect the relations between the two nations,"" he said.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 4 November
Kathmandu, 3 November: Dirgharaj Paudel, of Tarkerabari, Okhaldhunga [district in east Nepal], had hoped he would be able to return home after the declaration of a cease-fire. But Paudel, who became displaced six years ago after being beaten up by the Maoists on the charge of spying on them, has still not been able to return home.
He is living in a temple shelter in Koteshwor; all of his property is still under Maoist control. ""I had thought I could return home. The property seized from me has still not been returned,"" he says, ""The Maoists are using it; they haven't sent any message that they have returned it.""
The plight of Keshab Raj Acharya, who hails from Rautahat [district in south-central Nepal], is no different from that of Paudel. Displaced after being accused of not being involved with the Maoist party, his entire property has been seized. ""There was talk of allowing people to return home after the cease-fire [announcement],"" he said, ""I have not been able to return till now.""
Not only them, the majority of displaced people have not been able to return home?and neither have their properties been returned to them. The Maoists had made a commitment to returning all the properties they had seized, after the cease-fire came into effect.
The code of conduct for cease-fire, too, contained an agreement to return the properties of the displaced. But, the displaced complain, the Maoists continue to create obstacles to their return home, in violation of the agreement.
Not only those hailing from outside of the capital, even those displaced within the [Kathmandu] valley have not been able to return to their villages. Displaced from his home at Malta, Lalitpur on the charge of being a spy because his son was an ex-soldier, Rudranath Lamichhane says: ""They [Maoists] are using [my] house and property; [I] haven't been able to return home."" Now living in Imadole [in Lalitpur], he has not visited his village, which borders Makwanpur district, since four years back.
The lands and properties of not only lower-level ordinary political cadres but also that of the majority of the high-ranking leaders have not been returned. Says parliamentarian Binaya Dhoj Chand, whose lands in Bardiya and Kailali [districts in mid-west Nepal] were captured six years ago: ""Though on the surface they have made a commitment politically, the Maoists have not implemented it in practice."" He said he had not received his lands back even after the declaration of the cease-fire.
Pointing out that the Maoists had reached an agreement with the seven parties to allow the displaced to return home in a dignified manner, MP Chand said: ""[Maoists] have not done anything except making tall claims; just saying we have returned [lands and properties] won't do."" He said village-level taskforces should be formed to return the seized properties, in public, within a specified timeframe.
An MP from Dhanusha [district in south-central Nepal], Ananda Prasad Dhungana also said his is yet to get back his land which was seized four years ago. Mentioning that the Maoists had said that a petition had to be lodged at the party office to have it returned, he said: ""Why should I lodge a petition at a body that does not have any official authority."" The Maoists have not fulfilled the commitments they have repeatedly made, he said.
He opines that as the rebels have made a commitment to join multiparty competition, they must return all the seized properties and stop donation terror [extortion]. ""They are supposed to carry out activities by staying within the code of conduct, but that's not happening,"" said MP Dhungana.
The Maoist Victims' Association has also said that the majority of the displaced have not been able to return home. [passage omitted: the association's president says so]
According to government statistics, the number of displaced persons is 27,000. But the Association claims that the number much higher. The Maoists, however, claims that the process of repatriation of the displaced has already begun. ""The repatriation process has already begun,"" Maoist talks team member Dev Gurung said, ""There is an arrangement to deal with cases of injustice at the very places where they took place.""
He said repatriation depends on the wish of the displaced. ""Those staying in the capital are engaging in propaganda, too,"" he said, ""Whether they will return or not depends on their wish."" He also informed that a repatriation process, involving filing of petitions at the district-level, was under way. He said his party is committed to abide by the points in the code of conduct for cease-fire.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 5 February
Kathmandu, [Monday] 5 February: In order to battle deepening petroleum crisis in the Kathmandu Valley, the government has decided to fix a quota system on the distribution of petrol, effective from Monday.
An emergency meeting of the supply management committee headed by Baman Prasad Neupane, joint secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, decided to slap the quota on petrol supply as two litres for motorcycles and five litres for cars at one time from a pump.
""The quota system will be imposed on a trial basis until the supply situation gets back to normal,"" said Naindra Prasad Upadhaya, joint secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. He further said that the meeting also discussed various ways to ensure a smooth supply of necessary commodities, particularly petroleum products in the Valley.
The meeting also asked concerned authorities including Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) to seek alternative routes to import petroleum products such as Bhairahawa-Sunauli and Nepalgunj-Rupadiya, since the major import point at Birgunj-Raxaul remained closed for the 19th consecutive day.
The petroleum supply crisis deepened in the Kathmandu Valley as transportation remain[s] halted from Raxaul, India, where hundreds of tankers have been stranded due to the ongoing unrest in Terai region for the last two weeks.
The meeting was participated in by joint secretaries from the ministries of home affairs [and] supplies along [with] representatives of NOC, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, customs and commerce departments and Nepal Petroleum Dealers' Association (NPDA).
It also asked the security authorities to be vigilant to avoid possible disturbances and ensure smooth supply of fuel.
The meeting also discussed allowing vehicles fuel supply on even and odd number basis in the Kathmandu Valley, if the supply situation further worsens. They also considered importing petroleum through Kakarbhitta-Panitanki route in eastern Nepal, where supply has been hit hard due to the ongoing Terai unrest and closure of Biratnagar-Jogbani route.
Meanwhile, Ichha Bikram Thapa, spokesperson at NOC, informed that the sole petroleum supplier on Sunday released 84,000 litres petrol, 120,000 litres kerosene and 240,000 litres of diesel from its Thankot depot. He said the supply in the Valley would remain disturbed unless transportation through Birgunj-Raxaul route is relieved.
""NOC has already started fetching petroleum products from its Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj depots. So far, we have brought 140,000 litres of petrol, 348,000 litres of diesel and 360,000 litres of kerosene in the last three days,"" Thapa told this daily.
On other hand, dealers say that NOC started fetching petroleum only few days ago although supply was abnormal for the last 10 days. The current supply is less than one-third of the effective demand.
""Most pumps out of a total of 114 in the Valley have already gone dry. The few ones still distributing fuel are facing problems due to long queues,"" said Shiva Prasad Ghimire, president of Nepal Petroleum Dealers' Association (NPDA).
Besides petrol, shortage in cooking gas (LPG) has also hit the Valley hard, as major gas suppliers have already shut down their bottling plants citing lack of stock. More than 60 gas tankers carrying over 1,000 metric tonnes of LPG have been stranded at Raxaul for the past 10 days.

"3799",20053102,"Title: Nepal army searching for missing troops, UN concerned for civilians.rtf; Date: August 11, 2005 Thursday 1:38 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's army was Thursday scouring remote mountains in the northwest for scores of soldiers still missing four days after a battle with Maoist rebels, as the UN said it feared for the safety of civilians in the battle zone.
Around 75 soldiers remained unaccounted for after a rebel attack on an army camp near the town of Kalikot on Sunday, the army said. ""The search operation is continuing,"" said an army official who asked not to be named.
The army said Tuesday that 40 soldiers had been executed in the fighting, the deadliest incident since King Gyanendra seized power in February to try to crush an insurgency that has left 12,000 dead in nine years.
But rebel leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, denied army claims the troops had all been shot in the head at point-blank range, saying 52 soldiers had been captured and were being treated well.
They would be freed ""at an appropriate time,"" he said. ""The army's claims that we lined up the 40 soldiers and brutally murdered them after taking them under control is baseless, imaginary and untrue.""
An army statement said a search was continuing for rebels who might try to flee the area, while an army official said poor weather was hampering the hunt for the missing troops.
The head of the Nepal office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ian Martin, urged both sides to respect established laws on conflict to ensure civilians are protected.
""I am very concerned for the safety of the civilian population in the vicinity of the fighting and, once again, urge both parties to respect international humanitarian law,"" Martin said in a statement received Thursday. 
""This requires that every effort is made to protect civilians, as well as persons who are no longer taking part in hostilities.""
He had, he added, appealed to the Maoists to treat captured soldiers ""in accordance with international standards.""
""I welcome the public assurance that this will be the case and that those captured will be released,"" Martin said.
A monitoring team from his office had viewed 14 of the dead at Birendra Military Hospital in Kathmandu, he said.
He did not comment on their wounds but said army claims that they had been executed ""need to be carefully verified.""
""If confirmed, they would be very serious violations of international law,"" Martin said.
""I therefore urge the Royal Nepal Army to ensure that a full forensic examination of the victims is conducted by qualified, independent experts.""
The Maoists, who have since 1996 been fighting to instal a communist republic in the Himalayan kingdom, have said 26 of their fighters were killed in Sunday's fighting.
None of the claims could be verified, but analysts say the military appears to have made little headway since the king's seizure of power against the rebels.
US ambassador James F. Moriarty warned Tuesday that the kingdom could slide into chaos unless King Gyanendra reconciled with political parties.
The army said separately on Thursday that 14 rebels had been killed in the latest clashes in southwestern and western Nepal.

Twelve Maoists were killed in a gunbattle with security forces at Chhita Pokhara in the Khotang district, 340 kilometers (212 miles) east of Kathmandu, a police officer said.
Elsewhere in eastern Nepal, Maoists opened fire outside a bus where police were checking passengers' identities, killing two policemen and a female street vendor, said Sita Ram Pokharel, the chief administrator for the Jaljale-Gaighat area.
The rebels also bombed five public utilities in the southeastern industrial hub Janakpur, disrupting telephone service and power and prompting an elderly man's death from a heart attack, police inspector Bharat Khadka said.
Maoist supremo Prachanda had Friday said the Maoists would ""adjourn all our aggressive activities"" from October 2 to 10 as residents flock to their home villages to celebrate the post-monsoon festival Dasain.
But the Maoists, who ended a ceasefire on August 27 after seven months, warned it would end the temporary truce if the army used the occasion to attack the rebels.
Information Minister Kamal Thapa, the government spokesman, would not say if security forces would also observe a holiday ceasefire.
""The government has never declared a war. Whatever the government has done is to contain the violence,"" Thapa told reporters.
""We welcome the ceasefire,"" he added.
Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said the Maoists should try to relaunch negotiations during Dasain, which celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the forces of evil.
""What the government wants is a permanent ceasefire again,"" said Lohani, who with Thapa led the team that unsuccessfully negotiated with the Maoists this year.
""In the last round of talks we told the Maoists that even if they had differences they should honor the ceasefire, but they abruptly ended it. Now is a time to work again for a permanent solution,"" Lohani said.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist state. Since the end of the truce at least 280 people have died in renewed fighting, according to government figures.
The tolls from most incidents are impossible to verify independently as they take place in isolated rural areas.
Madhav Kumar Nepal, the consensus prime ministerial candidate of the mainstream parties -- which do not recognize the royal-appointed government -- said both the Maoists and the government needed to show more commitment to peace.
""Both the government and the Maoists need to observe a permanent, long-term ceasefire,"" Nepal told AFP.
""We welcome the Maoists' ceasefire, but it is only temporary. They haven't succeeded in creating an atmosphere of trust,"" Nepal said.
""They should have stated very clearly that they're not going to attack innocent people or the general public,"" he added.
Prachanda in his statement said the Maoists were ready for a permanent ceasefire if the government agreed to set up a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The rebel demand was the key dispute that scuttled the last negotiations on August 19 after three days.

"767",20031401,"Title: Nepal MPs convene new _parliament_ after beating by riot police.rtf; Date: May 28, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Around 10 members of Nepal's dissolved parliament were injured Wednesday when baton-wielding police barred them from forcibly reopening the assembly.
Some 200 politicians, prevented from entering the parliament shut down a year ago, instead convened in a nearby building, passed a resolution condemning ""police brutality"" and said they would hold another meeting of ""parliament"" Thursday.
The MPs from the dissolved house were among 10,000 demonstrators who marched toward parliament but were stopped by riot police who charged them with batons and lobbed tear-gas grenades, an AFP correspondent witnessed.
He said around 10 MPs were injured and needed hospital care including R.B. Paswan, who was deputy speaker of the dissolved upper house, and Bam Dev Gautam, a senior leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, which was parliament's main opposition.
King Gyanendra dismissed parliament a year ago under the advice of then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and called new elections for November 13.
But in October, Gyanendra also dismissed Deuba, calling him ""incompetent"" at dealing with Nepal's myriad ills including the long-running Maoist insurgency.
The king appointed as the new prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, known as a staunch royalist, to serve until new elections are called. All major parties have refused to serve under him.
The MPs, prevented from entering the Central Secretariat that includes the parliament, declared the assembly back in session at the Royal Academy Hall.
They elected as their ""speaker"" former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who launched a scathing critique of the king before the delegates.
""One of the main reasons for Nepal's economic backwardness is the crown. The king dominates Nepalese society and politics and he hasn't given a free hand for economic development,"" said Koirala, leader of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the last parliament.
The unrest comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the conquest of Mount Everest, which Nepal has been promoting heavily in hopes of wooing back tourists scared off by a seven-year Maoist insurgency.
While Chand's government has failed to make peace with the political parties, his government can claim credit for reaching a ceasefire with the Maoists.
The two sides have since held two rounds of peace talks since the truce went into effect January 29. More than 7,800 people have died in the insurgency since the Maoists declared a ""people's war"" in February 1996 aimed at overthrowing the constitutional monarchy.
The parliament included a 205-member lower house and 60-seat upper house.

Fakir Mohammed Sheikh, 26, is being held for questioning over the killing of archaeologist Gudarun Corvinus, 72, said Deputy Commissioner of Police A.D. Shinde.
Shinde said Sheikh killed the woman immediately after giving her a check for 3.4 million rupees (US$79,000; [euro]65,000) to purchase the apartment in Pune, a once-small town about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Bombay that is booming because of outsourcing companies based there.
The body was found in the bathroom; the severed head on a nearby river bank. Shinde said the woman was probably killed on New Year's Day.
The victim worked in Nepal and South Africa and had divorced her husband, a scientist based in Pune.
Police said she lived alone in the apartment and was trying to sell it. Several real estate agents had visited it in December, Shinde said.
Sheikh was arrested Sunday. Hours later, a judge remanded him to police custody until Jan. 16 for further interrogation, said Shinde.
""Police have time now to find out whether there were any others involved in the crime. From Sheikh, we have recovered the keys of her flat, her computer and other documents. He also had an injury on his arm which he has failed to explain,"" said Shinde.
Police entered Corvinus' home on Saturday after a friend reported that she had not heard from Corvinus for several days.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 24 March
Kathmandu, 23 March: Voicing deep concern over the spiralling human rights violations in Nepal, Amnesty International said it wants to keep all the Royal Nepalese Army [RNA] personnel guilty of violating human rights out of peacekeeping missions and called for a screening mechanism to purge such personnel. 
Amnesty International has urged the United Nations to ""screen out"" such RNA personnel from UN peacekeeping missions. RNA Human rights violators have reportedly been participating in such missions, Amnesty International has claimed. ""UN should weed RNA human rights violators from peacekeeping missions. It is not good that they be part of such missions,"" said Purna Sen, Asia-Pacific programme director of AI, London. 
A four-member AI delegation led by Sen monitored the country's human rights situation from 20-23 March. Kavita Menon, Nepal researcher of AI, London, said there were allegations that RNA human rights perpetrators were being sent for peacekeeping missions. She added, however, that AI is yet to verify such cases. The international watchdog came down heavily on both the warring factions - the RNA and the Maoists - for gross human rights violations. 
""It is only by the cessation of hostilities that there can be adequate and effective protection of human rights of the Nepali people,"" said Sen at a programme organised by Amnesty International here today. The team also met the Maoists and urged them to honour their public pledge to respect human rights and to translate it into reality. 
The team expressed concern over the abduction and recruitment of children in the rebel militia to Maoist leaders Keshav Pahadi and Naresh Bhandari. The rebels denied child recruitment . The international watchdog welcomed the recent pact between the Maoists and the seven political parties. ""We welcome the renewed hope. We want to see that their commitment to human rights come to fruition,"" said Sen. ""International pressure so far has helped curb some of the worst violations by the security forces but the fundamental problem of impunity for human rights has not been addressed,"" said Kate Allen, director of AI, UK. Though the number of disappearances have fallen hundreds of such cases remain unresolved, she added. 
The team also met Durga Pokharel, state minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare, RNA authorities, the diplomatic community, members of civil society and victims of human rights abuses by both sides. The team also visited prisoners of conscience, Krishna Pahadi and Shyam Shrestha. AI urged the government to release all the nine detained political leaders and activists, including the general secretary of CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)], Madhav Kumar Nepal. It also condemned the government's raid on Nepal's house yesterday. Although AI has not yet reached a conclusion concerning debate over the imposition of smart sanctions against Nepal, it is closely observing the issue and weighing the impact of the move, said team members.

"7726",2011361,"Title: Powerful 6.8 quake rocks northeast India.rtf; Date: September 18, 2011 Sunday 2:27 PM GMT; Text: A powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the mountainous northeast Indian state of Sikkim on Sunday, triggering strong tremors felt in neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan.
Sikkim Chief Secretary Karma Gyatso told the CNN-IBN news channel that there were initial reports of one child having been killed in the quake, but there was no immediate confirmation.
Residents of the state capital Gangtok said large cracks had developed in some buildings.
The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the quake, which struck at around 6:10pm (1240 GMT), was located just over 60 kilometres (40 miles) northwest of Gangtok.
""It was a massive earthquake. We have alerted the armed forces and the paramilitary,"" Gyatso said.
Telephone lines to Gangtok were temporarily knocked out and mobile networks were quickly swamped, making communication with the affected area difficult.
Gangtok resident C.K. Dahal told CNN-IBN that the city had been plunged into darkness by a power cut immediately after the quake, which lasted for around 20 seconds.
""There is no electricity. Everybody is out on the road,"" Dahal said.
""We all ran out our houses, some even jumped out of their windows. You can see some buildings that have developed cracks,"" he added.
Manish Sharma, a doctor attending a conference in Gangtok, told the NDTV news channel that guests in his hotel had all run for the doors as soon as the first tremors were felt.
""I am standing in front of the legislative assembly of Gangtok and I can see one of the outer buildings... the upper side is in two parts,"" Sharma said.
""I can see light coming out of that particular portion. It has not collapsed but it is in two parts, one part has moved aside,"" he said. ""The police are trying to calm people down.""
Powerful tremors were felt in Guwahati, the main city in neighbouring Assam state, some 600 kilometres away, sending panicked residents running into the streets.
The quake also shook buildings in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, 270 kilometres west of the epicentre, where traffic came to a standstill and hotels and bars were evacuated.
Hundreds of anxious tourists and office workers waited for news in car parks and on the streets as the seasonal monsoon rain lashed down. 
Three people were injured as a wall in the British Embassy compound in central Kathmandu collapsed, the Himalayan Times reported on its website.
In Bhutan, the capital Thimpu was rocked by the tremors.
""Our wooden house is safe. Jars fell in kitchen, books fell from shelf,"" Thimpu resident Aby Tharakan, a media consultant, said in a message posted on the microblogging website Twitter.

"3770",2005686,"Title: USE BIMST-EC FOR HIGHER E-COMMERCE VOLUME WITH ASEAN, SAARC_ ASSOCHAM.rtf; Date: October 14, 2005 Friday 2:36 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Oct. 14 -- The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) issued the following press release:
  Since BIMST (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal) Economic Cooperation is fast emerging as an influential and stronger regional bloc compared to ASEAN and SAARC, India thus should make use of its growing economic potential to significantly enhance its trade ties with ASEAN and SAARC, according to an analysis carried out by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM). 
  The analysis which will be compressed in a paper for government consideration on `BIMST-EC Vs. ASEAN and SAARC', points out that BIMST-EC has not only acquired a reasonable stronger regional position but is full of activities to prove to be above narrow political and economic considerations as it always attracts participation from its member countries at any given time. 
  ""ASEAN and SAARC, however, are devoid of this advantage because of conflict of interest among their member countries on account of various economic and political considerations,"" highlights the analysis. 
  Sharing the contents of the analysis, ASSOCHAM President, Mr. Mahendra K. Sanghi said that BIMST-EC has the advantage of being in its fold a ASEAN country like Thailand and a SAARC country like Sri Lanka, with whom India already signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which will help it increase its access in both the regional groupings viz. ASEAN and SAARC. 
  It further says that Thailand and Sri Lanka can be used by India as joint gateways to increase its penetration to seize larger chunk of ASEAN and SAARC markets because both Thailand and Sri Lanka have already emerged as significant regional trading hubs in the region. ""While Thailand will provide larger and wider access to Indian industry to western markets, besides ASEAN region, Sri Lanka will help India make smoother movements of its goods and services towards the entire SAARC region including that of Pakistan because of its strategic location,"" stresses the analysis. 
  It has been observed in it that ever since ASEAN and SAARC came into being, lesser interaction among their member countries have taken place due to variety of economic and political compulsions and considerations which often marred their scheduled negotiations in various meetings, conclaves and summit level talks. 
  In case of BIMST-EC, most of their slated interactions have taken place in time as its member countries are more often than not observed to be taking keen interest in any given time. It is because of this reason that this regional group will have the potential of becoming a major trading bloc to establish and build stronger bridges and linkages between ASEAN and SAARC too, the chambers points out. 
  It recommends multi-pronged areas of joint cooperation among the BIMST-EC for not only working closer but also capturing the market size of developed and developing economies in areas of textiles and garments, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, information technology, communication, projects exports in areas of construction of highways, ports, airports and seaports, oil and gas, fruit and vegetable, agriculture products, tourism, tea and coffee, besides spices. 
  The BIMST-EC region comprises GDP of around US$ 700 billion and a population of around 1,300 million has the potential to become a prominent regional groupings in the region and could further represent a bridging of the two important regions of the South Asia and South East Asia thereby enhancing closer economic cooperation in the region. 
  The ASSOCHAM also suggests that BIMST-EC should strive to develop into a Free Trade Area (FTA) to focus on activities that facilitate trade, increase investment and promote technical cooperation among the member countries. Under the FTA, the products except those included in the negative list will be subject to tariff reduction or elimination on two tracks - `fast track and normal track'. For India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, the time frame for products under `fast track' will be July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2009. For Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, the time frame would be July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2011. For products under ""normal track"" the time frame for India, Sri Lanka and Thailand will be July 1, 2007 to June 30 2012 and for Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal, it is July 1, 2007 to June 30 2017.

"5143",20064511,"Title: Burt Todd, 81, Entrepreneur Who Dreamed Big, Is Dead.rtf; Date: May 7, 2006 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Burt Kerr Todd, an entrepreneur, adventurer and international deal maker whose quixotic dreams and outlandish schemes more than occasionally paid off, as when he introduced the postage stamp to the tiny kingdom of Bhutan or resold the gently used Rolls-Royces of down-at-the-heels maharajas at a handsome profit, died on April 28 at his home in Ligonier, Pa. He was 81.
  The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
The son of a wealthy Pittsburgh steel, glass and banking family, Mr. Todd combined the larger-than-life appetites of an F. Scott Fitzgerald hero with the lust for adventure of a 19th-century explorer. His exact job defied description, though it entailed both the businessman's art of the deal and the confidence man's gift of the gab.
  Officially, Mr. Todd was president of the Kerr-Hays Company, an importing and manufacturing concern, now based in Ligonier, that he founded in 1963. But even before that, and for many years afterward, his portfolio included advising heads of state -- mostly of small countries in Asia and the Pacific -- on attracting American investment. At one time or another, Mr. Todd counted among his friends the sultan of Brunei, the king of Bhutan and the premier of the island of Mauritius.
  A dazzling raconteur, Mr. Todd never lacked for material. He flew airplanes and maintained an impressive collection of vintage cars. He hunted leopards and rhinoceroses and was once treed in Bhutan by a rampaging elephant. He knew everyone, could sell anybody anything and was for years the bane of Pittsburgh long-distance operators, who were obliged to patch him through to all manner of obscure places at all manner of ungodly hours.
  Impulsive, expansive, incurably restless, Mr. Todd might bundle his family into their little jet on a moment's notice. His sense of direction was not the best, and they did not always wind up where they intended. It rarely mattered. Wherever Mr. Todd turned up, something exciting was bound to result: a marvelous story, a new friendship or perhaps a deal involving rum, seaweed or other interesting commodities.
  ''There was something like bat guano,'' his daughter Laura Todd Widing recalled in a telephone interview on Friday. ''It's good for something.''
  Mr. Todd finessed his way into graduate school at Oxford despite having just a year of college; trekked hundreds of miles through Nepal and was the first American to visit Bhutan, the last of the forbidden kingdoms of the Himalayas.
  He once tried to found a small kingdom himself, on a deserted coral reef in the South Pacific. Its entire infrastructure was to be built on postage stamps. His dream was dashed, he later said, after Tongan gunboats blew his island paradise to ruins.
  Except for the gunboats, all of the above is true, Mr. Todd's daughter said.
  Burt Kerr Todd was born in Pittsburgh on May 15, 1924, the son of Kirkland W. Todd and the former Kathryn Kerr. By his own admission an indifferent student, he attended the Choate School before enrolling at Williams College. After the United States entered World War II, he left to enlist in the Army Air Corps, where he became a radar instructor.
  When the war ended, Mr. Todd decided he would attend Oxford. His academic record, or lack thereof, did not deter him. Oxford told him that enrolling was quite impossible: the only official who could authorize it was just then on his honeymoon in the remote Norwegian countryside. Mr. Todd flew to Norway, tracked down the official and promptly enrolled. At Oxford, his friends included a future leader of Fiji and the future queen of Bhutan, the first person from her country to study in the West.
  Mr. Todd graduated in 1949 with a master's degree in law. Two years later, chafing in his family's glass business in Pittsburgh, he received a cable from the Bhutanese royal family inviting him to visit. There was no air service, and few roads. Entering Bhutan from India, Mr. Todd became one of the few Westerners ever to see the country. His account of his journey appears in the December 1952 issue of National Geographic.
  In 1954, Mr. Todd married Frances Hays, known as Susie, and the couple honeymooned in Bhutan. Besides his wife and daughter Laura, both of Ligonier, Mr. Todd is survived by another daughter, Frances Todd Stewart, of Pittsburgh; a brother, Kirkland W. Todd Jr., of Nashville; and five grandchildren.
  Retained as an adviser by the Bhutanese royal family, Mr. Todd was asked to help expand the country's economic base. He suggested stamps, and in October 1962, Bhutan issued its first regular postage stamps.
  In other work, Mr. Todd helped Fiji to make rum and Singapore to market seaweed. In India, he persuaded maharajas in financial straits to part with their Rolls-Royces, which he resold to Western collectors. (One car, a convertible Phantom III, came with a pop-up silver chair to accommodate a footman.)
  But it was for the Bhutanese stamps that Mr. Todd was best known"

  The authorities issued an alert on the border as violence erupted in the Nepalese towns of Bhainrawa, Krishna Nagar and Butwal. A mob set four dozen buses and a dozen motorcycles ablaze near three Customs checkposts at Krishna Nagar adjacent to the border. The Nepalese police opened fire on a mob which indulged in loot and arson.
  The markets in Barhni town of Siddharth Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh were closed following the violence. Senior officials of the Sashastra Seema Bal, the Provincial Armed Constabulary and the police were camping in the town to monitor the situation.
  Sashastra Seema Bal chief public relations officer SR Sahu confirmed to Hindustan Times that patrolling was intensified after the alert. He said uneasy calm prevailed in towns and villages on the Indian side.
  Sources said the Indo-Nepal border had been sealed in view of the violence, but Sashastra Seema Bal officials denied the report. Sahu said so far no untoward incident was reported from the Indian side.
  Khan had been moving about without security on Sunday when he was killed. Earlier, Royal Army jawans had been deputed for his security, but he preferred to do without them.
  On March 17, 2007, Maoists had attacked the residence of Khan. Half-a-dozen Maoists and Khan's brother had been killed in the shootout.

"7218",2008895,"Title: Nepal _ Press freedom a priority for reporting elections - IFJ.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: April 7, 2008 Monday
Text of press release by Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists, on 7 April
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) extends its full support and solidarity to its affiliates, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ), the Nepal Press Union (NPU) and the National Union of Journalists, Nepal (NUJN), and all journalists in Nepal as they report on the country's national elections scheduled for April 10.
As Nepal approaches a crucial step in its transition to democracy, the IFJ calls on the caretaker government, national officials, local authorities and militant groups to guarantee journalists are not obstructed in preparing news reports before, during and after the Constituent Assembly election.
Journalists in Nepal have faced a treacherous period of forced closures and targeted attacks by police officials, members of the public and militant groups who hold journalists and media institutions responsible for reporting information with which they disagree.
Pushkar Shrestha, editor of New Highway and New Season, was killed on January 10. His murder was allegedly committed by the Jwala Singh faction of the Janatantrik Terai Mutki Morcha (JTMM-J), an armed group fighting for independence in the Terai region in Nepal's south-east.
Ongoing ""bandhs"", or strikes, instigated by the United Democratic Madheshi Front (UDMF) and the Federal Republic National Front (FNRF) in the Terai during February caused the closure of 18 Jhapa-based newspapers due to supply shortages.
More than 25 incidents of physical harm instigated against journalists and media workers have been reported since the beginning of 2008.
""As the people of Nepal prepare for the national elections, the IFJ calls on all media owners and security personnel to ensure that journalists' safety is a priority before, during and after April 10,"" said IFJ Asia-Pacific Director Jacqueline Park.
""Editorial independence and the liberty and safety of journalists are principles of press freedom that the Nepal media must be granted in order to provide fair and balanced reporting of the election campaign and its outcome.""
The IFJ encourages all journalists and media institutions to uphold their responsibility to report fairly on the election and to stand by their strong and unified defence of the right to a free media and free expression as a crucial element of democracy.

The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) has said at least eight soldiers were killed and nine others were injured in a landmine explosion within the RNA barrack at Tamghas, the district headquarters of Gulmi, some 350 km west of capital, Kathmandu, on Saturday [29 April].
According to officials, the explosion took place at around 11.30 a.m. [0545 gmt] on Saturday as a group of soldiers were digging at the perimeter of the barrack to construct defence positions. The soldiers were new to the area and had just replaced the old battalion.
The RNA officials said injured soldiers have been airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment.
The incident has occurred just three days after the three-month-long unilateral cease-fire announced by the Maoist rebels.
The new government led by G.P. Koirala is likely to reciprocate to the Maoist offer, according to reports.

KATHMANDU, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali anti-government insurgents and its student wing called off their pre-called nationwide general strike and indefinite educational strike separately in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the insurgents' dialogue with the government.
In a statement signed last Sunday by the insurgents' supreme leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, the insurgents decided to ""withdraw the 'Nepal bandh' (nationwide general strike)"" slated for February 13 and 14.
They also announced to mark the 8th anniversary of ""the people' s war"" which falls on February 13, New Year Day of the Nepali traditional calendar, ""in a peaceful manner.""
Meanwhile, the insurgents' student wing All Nepal National Independent Students' Union (Revolutionary) announced on Wednesday to cancel the indefinite educational strike scheduled from Feb. 13, ""so as to create a conducive environment for the on-going peace talks.""
The government and the anti-government insurgents announced an immediate cease-fire last Wednesday in a bid to end the seven-year- long insurgency through peaceful negotiations.
The insurgency has claimed over 7,000 lives, including guerrillas, security forces personnel and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
The year 2002 witnessed a total of 39 days of insurgent-called ""bandhs"" (strikes) in Nepal, almost twice that of the kingdom's total holidays, causing heavy losses to the economy.
The 39 days of strikes by the insurgents included 15 days of "" Nepal bandhs"" (nationwide general strikes), four days of ""Valley bandhs"" (strikes in the Kathmandu Valley), five days of strikes in other parts of the country and 17 days of educational strikes.
These actions had crippled the normal life throughout the kingdom, as most of the shops, industries and educational institutions remained closed and vehicles stayed off the roads.  Among others, the stock market saw a marked decline in terms of monetary transactions.
Also, the strikes were usually accompanied by bombing and killing incidents, in which the insurgents destroyed government and private company buildings, hydropower projects, telecommunications stations and other infrastructures.
Two months ago, the student union forced all the educational institutions throughout the Kathmandu Valley to close down for two weeks.
The educational strikes have created a havoc in about 1,700 private and 8,000 public schools in the valley and 102 campuses affiliated to the country's four universities. An estimated 800, 000 students had been sitting idle at home or go abroad for learning.
The Nepalese people are fed up by these strikes. They hope the on-going negotiations between the insurgents and the government could produce something to improve the situation for the nation.

Excerpt from unattributed report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 25 April
Kathmandu, 24 April: After Friday's [21 April] royal announcement, the home minister of the caretaker government, Kamal Thapa, has stationed himself at the Royal Nepalese Army [RNA] Headquarters and is giving orders to the Unified Command to suppress the peaceful movement.
The leadership of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] had strongly objected with the police top brass about the intense suppression of peaceful demonstrations by the Unified Command which is led by the RNA and consists of Nepal police and the Armed Police Force. In reply, the top brass said it is Home Minister Thapa who gives them orders and they were compelled to obey.
For the past few days, [Minister] Thapa has established his office at the Army Officers' Club at the RNA Headquarters in Bhadrakali [Kathmandu]. Sixteen demonstrators including three in Kathmandu have died and about 6,000 have been injured due to brutal use of force against peaceful demonstrators.
According to a high-level source CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist-Leninist] standing committee member Amrit Kumar Bohara had requested the chief of Armed Police Force [APF], Sahabir Thapa, to exercise restraint. At first, Thapa reacted angrily. But as he was warned that he would face consequences for aiding and obeying persons lacking people's support who are in the power illegally and are committing crime against humanity, Police Chief Thapa said he was acting under compulsion.
APF Chief Thapa was approached as part of the seven opposition parties' strategy to hold discussions with RNA Chief of Staff Pyar Jung Thapa, Civil Police Chief Shyam Bhakta Thapa, Armed Police Force Chief Sahabir Thapa, and National Investigation Department Chief Devi Ram Sharma, regarding the suppression of the movement.
Though Bohara refused to divulge the details of his talks with APF Chief Thapa, he said the parties have decided to hold talks with the chiefs of security agencies. ""Your 200,000 men can never suppress the entire Nepalese people,"" Bohara had told Thapa, adding, ""We are urging you to exercise restraint only because you are a fellow Nepali.""
The leaders also urged the security chiefs to think before obeying the orders of the ministers of the government that has become a mere caretaker following 21 April royal address.
In the recent days, the security chiefs, on the order of Home Minister Thapa, had ordered their troops to use helicopters to suppress the peaceful movement. Even women, children and the elderly participating in the demonstrations were attacked on the pretext of 'terrorist' [Maoist] infiltration. [passage omitted: Bohara said those suppressing the demonstration should be punished]

"178",20032091,"Title: Nepal 's king restates support for democracy despite sacking PM.rtf; Date: January 3, 2003 Friday; Text: King Gyanendra Friday reiterated his support for a multi-party democracy but said Nepal was at a ""difficult crossroads"", as he made a rare public visit outside Kathmandu amid tight security because of threats from Maoist rebels.
""We are, at present, at a very difficult and complex crossroads, with many challenges ahead of us,"" he told a reception of around 100,000 people in Biratnagar, 290 kilometres (181 miles) southeast of here.
""All of us must work together in the creation of a dynamic and prosperous new Nepal with a constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy as its cornerstones.""
Multi-party democracy is a relatively new phenomenon in Nepal -- the king ruled as an absolute monarch from 1960 to 1990 when legislators were forbidden from holding party affiliations.
King Gyanendra has been criticised by all the main political parties since he sacked the elected prime minister in October, installed an interim government and indefinitely postponed elections.
In what appeared to be a rebuke to politicians in his first public statement since October, he said: ""It is our desire that instead of indulging in mutual recrimination, all patriots should work in unison towards the nation's welfare.
""While talking of multi-party democracy, one should never be forgetful of the norms and values of the system nor should one be oblivious of the need to behave oneself according to the ideals of democracy,"" he said in the 15-minute speech broadcast live on national television.
Security was tight for the visit -- one of only a handful of public visits he has made outside the capital Kathmandu since ascending the throne more than 18 months ago -- as Maoist rebels had declared a strike in the area to restrict people getting to the reception.
But despite the strike call traffic was moving normally on the streets of Biratnagar and many people had poured into the town, eager to see the royal couple, witnesses said.
The town was festooned with the national flag and filled with pictures of the royal couple and banners reading ""Long live the king and queen"" and ""We love the king and queen more than ourselves"".
""I came all the way from Ilam (50 kilometres, 31 miles away) to see the king and the queen,"" Ramesh Chaulagain told the private Nepal Channel television network.
A Nepali-language evening newspaper ""Sandhyakalin"" said a group of 150 Maoist rebels had prevented 20 public buses from entering Biratnagar late Thursday, but there was no official confirmation.
In Lalitpur on the outskirts of Kathmandu a bomb planted by suspected Maoists went off an hour before Gyanendra made his speech, but no one was injured.
The king did not mention the Maoist rebellion directly, but he said disputes should be settled through dialogue.
""Patriotism must form the basis for the resolution of all feuds, while the greater good of the nation and people must be taken into consideration in finding amicable solutions to mutual differences,"" the king said.
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Home Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa went to Biratnagar Thursday to check security arrangements.
""Police and army personnel have been posted to foil any incidents during the royal couple's visit to the industrial township,"" the home minister said Thursday, adding security units were positioned every one kilometre (0.6 miles).
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed over 7,700 lives.
Gyanendra was crowned king after his brother King Birendra and eight other members of the royal family were killed by a drunken Crown Prince Dipendra in June 2001.

Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 24 Mar 03Addressing the roundtable conference of the women for the impending peace talks, Pun said even after the implementation of the code of conduct the Maoists have been resorting to extortion and violence in the villages.
 Mahara denied the charges coming from Minister Pun and said it was not the Maoists but the government forces who had been violating the code of conduct. He said his party had been receiving at least five to six reports regarding the violation of the code of conduct by the government bodies. He said the security forces had stormed into a roundtable conference organized by his party in Lalitpur Saturday and had arrested five Maoist cadres. Mahara claimed that the security forces arrested 10 Maoist cadres in Dhangadi Kailali District, far western Nepal and dislodged the martyr gates constructed by his party in different places.
 Pun said that the government was committed to hold peace talks with the Maoists at the earliest possible and would release the Maoist detainees in phases if the talks were held.

A high-ranking Maoist said on condition of anonymity that top rebel leaders met in mid-July and decided the guerrillas would shoot any troops seen more than five kilometers (three miles) away from their barracks, despite the ceasefire in place since January 29.
He said the meeting was chaired by the Maoists' elusive leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- known by the alias Prachanda (The Fierce) -- near Surkhet, 398 kilometers (248 miles) southwest of the capital Kathmandu.
In an apparent implementation of the policy, guerrillas late Wednesday opened fire on an army patrol in Surkhet district although there were no casualties on either side, an army official told AFP.
The official confirmed the troops were 10 kilometers (six miles) away from their barracks at Chhinchu but said it was a standard patrol.
On July 24, a female Maoist guerrilla was killed in a shootout triggered by a similar rebel attack on troops in the western Kalikot district, according to army officials.
Fearing a collapse of the ceasefire, Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa reviewed the security situation Wednesday with army, police and other security officials. He ordered all suspicious vehicles be searched in sensitive parts of Kathmandu, a source in his cabinet said.
""He alerted security personnel about the possibility of a sudden attack in the capital,"" the cabinet source said.
The issue of troop movements has dogged Nepal's peace process, with the guerrillas insisting the government agreed at May 9 talks to restrict patrols to within five kilometers of barracks. The government says there was no formal deal.
The Maoists adopted the shoot-on-sight strategy to pressure the army into agreeing to the restrictions on their movements outside of barracks, the Maoist said.
The rebels threatened to call off further peace talks unless the restrictions were imposed on troops and high-profile Maoist prisoners were released by Thursday.
The government Tuesday released four Maoist central committee members but said troop restrictions were irrelevant as soldiers only ventured more than five kilometeres from their barracks in ""an abnormal situation or in the national interest"".
The Maoists have not responded to the government's gesture or made any formal announcement on the shooting policy.
Maoist leaders who emerged from years of hiding after the ceasefire have gone back underground over the past week, fearing arrest.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Wednesday urged the government and Maoists to move forward with the peace process, which aims at ending the seven-year insurgency that has claimed more than 7,800 lives.
""The Secretary General appreciates the intense efforts that are ongoing at present to overcome the hurdles and urges the parties to persist with these efforts to bring the process back on track,"" said a statement from Annan, who this week dispatched one of his officials, Tamrat Samuel, to Kathmandu.
A previous ceasefire between the government and the Maoists collapsed after four months in 2001 when the rebels launched a flurry of attacks after talks stalled.
Nepal's mainstream political parties -- which oppose Thapa's government because it was appointed by King Gyanendra rather than elected -- have appealed to the Maoists not to back out of dialogue.
The Maoists also demanded this week the king play a greater role in the peace process. But the government responded that Gyanendra had invested authority in the cabinet.
The Maoists declared a ""people's war"" in February 1996 with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional monarchy and establishing a communist state.

 Police also used tear gas to disperse the unruly crowd of protesters shouting anti-king slogans at Ratna Park in front of the Narayanhity Royal Palace in Kathmandu, official residence of King Gyanendra.
 The protesters resorted to retaliation and some policemen were hurt, according to witnesses.
Supporters of the political parties agitating against the king's seizure of executive powers in October 2002 took to the streets in many other parts of the kingdom and clashed when police intervened, reports reaching the capital said.
 Scuffles with police were reported mainly from the Baglung and Dadeldhura districts of west Nepal.
 In the capital, party activists burnt tires at city intersections and damaged a number of vehicles after the two-day strike began Tuesday.
 The strike shut down major town and cities across the country.
 Shops and schools were shutters-down and roads quiet and even banking and financial institutions were closed, while the authorities deployed extra security in a bid to prevent violence.
 The parties had called the dawn-to-dusk strike to reinforce their demand that the king return executive powers to elected representatives.
 Since his takeover, the king has appointed two prime ministers, but the agitating parties have opposed the appointments on the grounds that under Nepal's Constitution the king appoints prime minister only on the recommendation of the House of Representatives.
 The lower house, however, remains dissolved.
 Meanwhile, on Tuesday the king held consultations with leaders of political parties, other than those agitating, on appointment of a new prime minister, after a third leader of the agitating five-party coalition, declined the call for a meeting with the monarch.
 Two prominent coalition leaders had similarly declined calls for royal audience Monday, saying they would want to meet the king only as a group.

Leaders of various political parties have said the prohibitory orders issued by the government yesterday were the result of its defeated mentality. The leaders, speaking at an interaction organized by the Reporters' Club Nepal in Kathmandu today said they would continue their peaceful movement and such prohibitory orders would not affect the movement.
Central Committee member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] Subash Nemwang termed the prohibitory orders as the result of defeated mentality and said the parties would defy the order. He said the set programmes of the seven parties would not be changed and that the prohibitory orders would be defied peacefully.
Speaking at the interaction, spokesperson of the Nepali Congress [NC], Krishna Sitaula, said the seven parties are determined to bring peace to the country so they would move ahead, foiling all kinds of schemes. He said the Maoist violence was the result of the government's disregard for the rebels' cease-fire. He said the government should take responsibility for the violence.
Similarly, the general secretary of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), Bimalendra Nidhi, said it was irresponsible of the government to think that the Maoists would infiltrate the parties' movement. He said the prohibitory orders would not affect the peaceful movement.

Rana said his faction of the party still support the monarch but do not favor his direct rule over this Himalayan nation.
""We believe in constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy,"" he said.
The party, the largest Nepalese group supporting King Gyanendra who seized absolute power last year, had been split in two groups last week.
Both factions of the Rastriya Prajatantra claim they are in control of the party and its offices. The breakaway faction claimed it had removed Rana from the party leadership at a party convention in Katmandu last week. But Rana's faction insists there has been no change in leadership and that the rebelling members have been expelled.
Since King Gyanendra seized power last February with the stated goal of crushing a bloody Maoist insurgency, the royalist party has been divided in two roughly equal factions.

In the past week alone, suspected Maoists have set off bombs in courts and offices in the capital Kathmandu, torched three tourist buses and blown up the food pantry at an upscale hotel in the popular Chitwan wildlife park.
No one was hurt in the attacks, but they underscored the chaos reigning in the Himalayan kingdom, where more than 9,500 people have died since 1996 in fighting with the Maoists who want to topple the monarchy.
""We have a feeling that there is no government in the country,"" said Prakash Kumar Singh, an organiser of the Trekking Agents Association-Nepal.
""Security forces have failed to protest tourist buses and public carriers carrying essential materials.""
The Maoists are never known to have harmed tourists, whose visits provide jobs to 1.25 million people in the cash-strapped land of Mount Everest.
But the Maoists and the array of labour and ethnic groups aligned with them regularly call strikes in bids to demonstrate popular support and take action against anyone who defies them.
The rebels called a nationwide shutdown from Tuesday to Thursday in part to show solidarity with massive anti-monarchy protests organised by opposition parties last month in Kathmandu.
The opposition, although not affiliated with the Maoists, has vowed to step up protests during the three-day strike to demand King Gyanendra reverse his 2002 decision to fire the elected government for ""incompetence"".
Surya Bahadur Thapa, the king's handpicked prime minister, resigned on May 7 under pressure from the street demonstrations and from donor nations, which have urged Gyanendra to respect human rights and democracy.
But no prime minister has been named to replace Thapa as opposition parties insist the king needs to negotiate with all of their leaders at once.
The political crisis has only reinforced that nobody rules the country of 25 million people.
The state-run dairy corporation announced Sunday that its stock in Kathmandu was falling short by 60 percent because of difficulties in transportation, particularly imports from India.
""Until next week,"" when the effects of the Maoist strike have receded, ""there is no possibility of meeting the regular supply of milk and milk products,"" dairy cooperation official Khadga Bahadur Thapa said.
The growing anarchy has also torn asunder delivery lines for other fresh produce.
""Some farmers have thrown their tomatoes, potatoes, oranges and mangoes out in anger as the government has failed to protect them,"" said Shankher Khadigi, a vegetable dealer at the Kalimati produce distribution centre in Kathmandu.
Major passenger bus operators have suspended services in southwestern and southeastern Nepal, the areas most devastated by the insurgency.
""Maoist bans on the movement of buses and public carriers have caused great inconvenience to people and big economic loss,"" said Suryakanta Regmi, a transport operator in the southern industrial city of Birgunj.
He said vehicles coming from India, just across the border from Birgunj, faced particular risk as Maoists had taken to attacking them, although no Indian nationals are known to have been killed.
The Maoists, who want to turn the world's only Hindu kingdom into a secular, communist republic, oppose India's overwhelming economic and cultural influence in the neighbouring country.
The loss of government authority has also hit hard Nepal's other international border, with Chinese-ruled Tibet.
Kewal Prasad Bhandari, a customs officer at the Tatopani crossing with Tibet, estimated that at least 14,000 dollars in potential government revenue was lost daily at his border post.
""Many importers and exporters no longer bother to pay revenue to the government,"" he said.
But even for those who pay customs, the road is perilous. Bhandari said several trucks and buses lie abandoned near the border after their operators gave up on negotiating through the strikes and Maoist ambushes.

  The rebels who say they will join talks with the new multi-party government to try to end the uprising are now looking forward to participate in the interim government for the interest of the people.
  ""The Maoists will definitely take part in the interim government, because it's the party of the people and for the people. It will definitely take part in the government in the people's interest,"" said Vinod Upadhayay, a Maoist leader.
  Upadhayay added that a new constitution should be drafted.
  ""Our expectations and demand from this government are that a new constitution should be drafted. Nepal should set an example to the world by setting up a unique democratic set up,"" he said.
  Nepal's new multi-party government last week matched a Maoist truce and called the rebels for talks to which the guerrillas agreed. No date for the meeting has been fixed.
  Nepal's seven mainstream political parties and the Maoist rebels entered into a loose deal in November against King Gyanendra who took absolute power early last year.
  The new cabinet of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala - appointed after King Gyanendra bowed to weeks of protests and returned power to political parties - would also remove the ""terrorist"" tag on the rebels.
  The Maoists last week declared a three-month ceasefire in their decade-old campaign to topple the country's monarchy after King Gyanendra handed power back to the political parties.
  Maoists are now preparing for elections to an Assembly to write a new constitution and decide the future of the monarchy.
  The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to set up one-party communist rule in the Himalayan kingdom. But they now say they will accept the outcome of the election to the special assembly.
  More than 13,000 people have died in the conflict that has also badly hurt Nepal's aid and tourism dependent economy.

"2104",20045310,"Title: News Analysis_ SAARC moves to strengthen cooperation in economic, social fields by Rong Shoujun.rtf; Date: January 3, 2004, Saturday; Text: by Rong Shoujun
ISLAMABAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian leaders who will meet Sunday in Islamabad are eager to strengthen their cooperation in the economic and social fields and to promote stability, prosperity and progress in the region through joint actions.
The 12th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which was originally scheduled for early 2003 only becomes possible after India and Pakistan, two largest members of the regional grouping, eased their high tensions in the past year.
The two arch rivals resumed their ambassadorial ties and restored their land as well as air links snapped two years ago after the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament,  creating favorable atmosphere for the summit.
What's more, the troops from both sides began to observe effectively a ceasefire in Kashmir, the first in the past 14 years since an Islamic military struggle against Indian rule started.
Hopes have been raised that the SAARC leaders will make this summit fruitful and make some notable achievements. The 12th summit will open a totally new chapter in the history of the 18- year old body which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Currently focused mainly on the socio-economic issues, SAARC seeks to enlarge economic opportunities and welfare of the peoples of the region to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development. It has put wide-range economic cooperation and poverty elimination high on its agenda.
During a two-day preparatory meeting prior to the summit, the foreign ministers of the member states agreed on three key pacts to be signed at the summit. The agreements on free trade, terrorism and a social charter will top the agenda of the 12th summit.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri told reporters Friday that he is optimistic about the signing of the draft South Asian Free Trade Agreement, which business leaders are hoping will transform the home of half the world's poor into a powerful trade bloc.
The 10th summit held in Colombo in 1998 decided that member states to take measures to remove structural impediments in order to move speedily towards the goal of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). If an agreement on free trade area is signed and implemented, it will give the much-needed fillip to economic cooperation in South Asia, where the intra-regional trade is a paltry 3.4 percent as compared to the Association of the South Eastern Nations' 38.4 percent, 37.3 percent for North American Free Trade Area and 63.4 percent for the European Union.
A SAARC Social Charter is also to be signed by leaders of the member states at the summit. It sets minimum standards for social development in the region and puts in place a mechanism of cooperating on vital social issues that have not been given due attention over the years. Officials here termed the charter as significant milestone in the association's history, saying it would give member states a roadmap for social development.
The 10th SAARC summit in Colombo in 1998 directed that a Social Charter be developed for SAARC, elevating the status of national plans of action to a regional dimension with a specific role for the grouping. It was determined that the charter would focus on setting broad-range targets to be achieved across the region.
At the meeting of SAARC foreign ministers, an agreement was also reached on an ""additional protocol"" to an existing anti- terrorism agreement, referring to an extra clause on choking terrorist funding. It is designed to update the members' obligations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The SAARC leaders signed the Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism in Kathmandu in November 1987 during their 3rd Summit, which came into force on August 22, 1988 following ratification by all member states. The convention provides a regional focus to many of the well- established principles of international law in this respect. Under its provisions, member states are committed to extraditing or prosecuting alleged terrorists thus preventing them from enjoying safe havens.
Regional cooperation is also envisaged in preventive action to combat terrorism through exchange of information, intelligence and expertise identified for mutual cooperation under the convention.
In the context of rapid economic integration in other regions, the SAARC members hope to speed up their pace in setting up a free trade area and improve the social development. But it is widely believed that unless India and Pakistan, the two key players, further improve their ties and some bilateral political issues are addressed, as Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan put it, SAARC can not meet the expectations of its founders.

 Five political parties and their student wings called the dawn-to-dusk strike to protest against police intervention during their antimonarchy protests.
Security was tight in the cities and their environs where business and educational institutions were closed, and vehicular traffic stayed mostly off the streets.
 Government offices were open although attendance was reported to be thin Monday, which is the first working day of the week.
 In a pre-strike move Sunday, students and political activists carried out torch-lit rallies at several places.
 Political leaders said the government had forced them to call the closure by perpetrating an 'extreme form of atrocities' during peaceful protests.
 The leaders have also complained of police 'atrocity' against student leaders who are organizing public hearings on the relevance of the monarchy to Nepal.
 Nepal's mainstream political parties are fighting against what they call King Gyanendra's 'regressive step' Oct. 4, 2002, when he dismissed the elected prime minister and seized executive power for himself.
 The monarch has since failed to put the political process back on a democratic track, political party leaders say.

The Congress was in power for the last six-and-a-half years and they could have acted against the wrongdoers if there was any substance.
When the BJP and the NDA had raised the 2G allocation issue and losses estimations had been confirmed by an independent and autonomous body like CAG, they were now seeking to link the NDA with the scandal, Mr Prasad said.
The presumptive loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore was huge and many projects that could have transformed the country and its developmental programmes could have been taken up with the amount, he said.
Touching on the issue of terror, Mr Gadkari said the Maoists had carved out a red corridor from Nepal to Andhra Pradesh-'Pashupati to Tirupati'. The Maoist violence was not merely a social problem but they wanted to capture power through the barrel of the gun.
The Congress was also exhibiting its 'double standards' in dealing with the likes of people like Binayak Sen, who have been found guilty by the trial court.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese state-owned newspaper Gorkhapatra on 21 February
Kathmandu, 20 February: Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kirti Nidhi Bista has said that enlisting of female officers into the Royal Nepal Army has offered more opportunity and responsibility to women. Bista said this at a function held at a convocation ceremony of the army's officer cadets.
For the first time, female officers have been appointed. Before this, women were appointed only as technical personnel and basic level soldiers. This is the first time that women have been directly appointed to the officer level. Out of the total 272 officer cadets who underwent one year of training, 67 were women.
Vice-Chairman Bista said that women have now been provided with an equal opportunity to protect the nation's unity, integrity and sovereignty alongside their male counterparts. Enlisting women in the army has started to ensure that they are not deprived of their rights. This is a moment of pride, Bista said.
Terrorist activities have threatened the fundamental rights of citizens to life. Therefore, the challenging responsibility of fighting for truth, justice and humanity has fallen on the shoulders of the army personnel, he said. The army personnel need to translate their knowledge gained during training into practice and eliminate terrorism from the country. This is the call of the hour, Bista said. [passage omitted]

 The total number of disappearances from the state and the Maoist rebels in the last four years has alarmingly crossed 700, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said in a press meet on Thursday 4 December .
 Of the total disappearances (717), 587 were from the security forces and 111 from the rebels, said the national rights watchdog.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Dec 03The rest, 18 disappearances, were made from unknown people, the NHRC said. ""Details of one more disappeared could not be known.""
 Of the total disappeared people, the commission said, 651 were men and 66 women.  passage omitted
 ""It is a matter of grave concern that disappearances are frequently occurring in a democratic country like ours,"" Nain Bahadur Khatri, chairman of NHRC, said on the occasion.
 Khatri further said the commission has plans to make the state and the rebels aware of the disappearances.
 ""For this, our main agenda for the upcoming international human rights day (on 10 December) will be disappearances,"" he said. ""With the increasing number of disappearances, it seems that both the warring sides are seeking military' solutions.""
 On formation of Human Rights Promotion Centre by the government, Sushil Pyakurel, an NHRC member, said the NHRC will not work under the coordination of any rights bodies formed by the government.
 A separate act has authorized the NHRC to work independently for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country, Pyakurel said.
 Khatri, Pyakurel and other NHRC members were critical of the annual budget being allocated to the NHRC. ""The NHRC cannot function effectively with the meagre budget it receives,"" they said.

""The bodies of 35 Maoists have been recovered.
Three army men are dead and some others are injured,"" state radio said.
However, an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 44 Maoists and six soldiers were killed in the operation in Rolpa district, 460 kilometers (288 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu.
He said the toll in the clash, which was continuing into the evening, could rise past 100 and that the army had fired from a helicopter to break down Maoist defenses.
A police officer said troops and police raided a suspected Maoist hideout from three sides Wednesday morning on suspicion that senior rebels were there.
The army official described the hideout as a ""fortress"" surrounded by sandbags and stones to protect it from attack.
Tolls from clashes in Nepal are difficult to verify independently as they usually occur in isolated areas.
Rolpa is a rural district where the Maoists in February 1996 declared their ""people's war"" to topple the monarchy. The rebels ended a seven-month ceasefire on August 27.

 The government on Tuesday 2 November has said it has asked Royal Nepalese embassies in the Middle East to try to find out whereabouts of the Nepali citizen who was one of the eight persons taken hostage in Baghdad by an Iraqi insurgent group on Monday, and ensure his release.
 The government has also appealed to the group that has taken the Nepali citizen hostage to free him immediately and not to harm him.
 The government move came within hours of news reports that one of the persons taken hostage in Iraq was a Nepali security guard serving at the Saudi Arabian Trading and Contracting Company in the Mansur district of Baghdad.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 2 Nov 04
The identity of the Nepali national taken hostage by the Iraqis is yet to be ascertained, Foreign Ministry officials said.
 Spokesperson at the Foreign Ministry Durga Prasad Bhattarai told reporters that the government was trying to collect details about the person. ""We have instructed our missions in the Middle East to take immediate measures to get him freed,"" he added.
 Nepal doesn't have diplomatic relations with Iraq and has imposed ban on the Nepalis to go and work in the war-ravaged country. Reports, however, say hundreds of Nepalis have sneaked into Iraq from nearby countries and continue to work their risking their lives.
 Of the eight captured men, five were Iraqis, one was Nepali, one American and one Filipino. Two of the Iraqis were later released.
 The government had faced severe criticism after it failed to contact the insurgent group, Al-Ansar al-Sunnah, that had kidnapped a group of 12 Nepalis who had entered Iraq to work there. The brutal killing of the innocent Nepalis by the group in late August sparked violent protests in the capital, Kathmandu, on 1 September.
 An angry mob, said to have been infiltrated by agent provocateurs, had targeted and rampaged hundreds of offices of manpower agencies, media houses, mosques and GSA general sales agent offices of foreign airlines. Two persons were killed and the government had to impose curfew for several days to bring the situation under control.
 The government-formed commission to probe into the incident is yet to submit its report.

 The Royal Commission for Corruption Control has directed that the former prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and former Minister Prakashman Singh be kept in judicial custody for another five days for further investigations. Deuba has spent 15 days while Singh has been kept in custody for the past 20 days.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13:15 GMT, 11 May 05According to the commission's investigation officer Rajendra Pokharel Deuba and Singh have been directly linked to the irregularities in awarding of a contract for the construction of a tunnel in the Melamchi Drinking Water Project. Pokharel says the investigations are in the final stage and the commission will prepare its final report.
 During today's hearing on the case, both Deuba and Singh had reiterated their stance that they would not speak to the commission saying the commission was unconstitutional. According to reports, Deuba is reported to have challenged the investigating officers during today's hearing to show proof that he cancelled contracts for the Melamchi Drinking Water Project. Deuba said he and Singh had moved forward with the awarding of contracts based on the recommendations of the Asian Development Bank.
 While being taken back into judicial custody, Singh told reporters that he was being targeted as part of the government's political retribution.

 The inner cabinet has expertly disposed of the thorny problem of US overflight rights and troop transports. We will hear no more of it before the election. The next government will have to tackle a review of the 1971 secret agreement according to which our country pledges to give the United States free passage.
De Standaard web site, Groot-Bijgaarden, in Dutch 27 Mar 03
The debate could not have ended other than in this way, except for the farcical collapse of the government within an ace of the election. An annulment of the treaty would have made no difference because it provides for six months' notice. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt had rightly dismissed from the outset the suggestion that Belgium could ignore the treaty ""because the United States has placed itself outside international legality"" by beginning a unilateral war against Iraq. Where would it end if everybody began to ignore treaties unilaterally?
 For Live Differently Agalev - Dutch-speaking ecology party the matter has again ended in self-castigation, just as in the Nepal crisis. The masochism is even more flagrant. The glass was nine-tenths full, but a section of the rank and file still found it too empty. The purple-green government has positioned itself through its attitude as a dove on the side of the Germans and French. Instead of reaping the fruits of that, the Greens themselves obscured the picture by making it look as if the government is inconsistent. When you know that you will eventually have to reconcile yourself to the facts, you had better not talk too big. It will come back like a boomerang.
 In the meantime, it is odd that people are now talking loosely about secret treaties. There is perhaps reason to examine whether that secrecy is out of date, but it was not necessary to conduct that debate now, with all the foreseeable political damage resulting from that.
 The French, with whom our diplomacy has cast in its lot, did not make things so hard for themselves. President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin are undisputed doves and, as such, sitting targets for the Bush administration. But they quite simply announced that the passage of US military equipment was not an issue ""between allies"". End of story.
 There will now be a monitoring committee in the chamber which will set to work with the utmost discretion. Hence that will be the next banana skin. Members of parliament promising to keep silent about something to which they are opposed; that will not work. Just as it did not work in connection with the presence of nuclear weapons at Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium used by the USA as a nuclear weapons base .
 Nor will the review of the agreement be a routine job. A plan is under discussion to make military transports dependent on UN approval. That is so much at odds with the concepts which are currently prevalent in Washington that it will surely create diplomatic ructions.
 Before we tinker with that document, we had better think it through again anyway. Attaching conditions to US transports means in fact taking them hostage. In those circumstances, they will perhaps choose to reduce considerably their presence in our country and in Europe. Are we sure that we have already assessed all the implications of that?

The monitoring team of the Civil Society Forum says that the country will head toward further chaos if the government does not declare a cease-fire soon. In a report made public by the forum today, it has accused the government of not being serious about the peace process and alleged that there were no initiatives being taken by the government. Stating that the government had not taken the four month unilateral Maoist cease-fire seriously, the forum expressed its concern over the present situation in the country.
The forum, which monitored the Maoists cease-fire, said in its report today that the Maoists had not attacked any government infrastructure over the four months of the cease-fire.  The report also states that the government has continued its operations against the Maoists. The report has also concluded that the government was pushing the Maoists into breaking the cease-fire and taking the country into more conflict.
The president of the monitoring committee, Sambhu Thapa, who is also the president of the Nepal Bar Association, called on the government to try and find solutions to the country's problems rather than just hold municipal elections. He also appealed to the government to remove the terrorist tag from the Maoists and start dialogue with the political parties. Stating that the people of the country have experienced a degree of peace during the four-month cease-fire, Thapa also appealed to the Maoists to extend their cease-fire.
The report also said that the agreement reached between the Maoists and the opposition and the Maoist agreement to find a political solution to the country's problems, in principal, were positive signs. However, the report stated that the Maoists continued to kidnap and torture people and was also involved in raising money through forced donations. The report also said that the state had also tortured and killed Maoists who had been captured by the security forces.

Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 3 Jun 05 p 1
Private and government schools in Myagdi, Baglung and Parbat districts [all in west Nepal] were forced to shut down on 24 May after Maoists threats saying it was an educational blockade.
 Most of the schools that have shut down are in rural areas and has led to crisis in the education sector in those areas. Principal of Arjun Secondary School Durga Prasad Shrama said the schools were left with no other choice but to shut down due to lack of security in the face of Maoist threats.
 Majority of the schools in southern and western rural areas of Baglung, all schools in rural areas of Myagdi and schools in southern areas of Parbat districts have remained shut.

  A BJP delegation led by Lalji Tandon and BJP Legislature Party leader Om Prakash Singh called on the Governor at the Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum urging him not to give his assent to a proposed ordinance through which the Mayawati government allegedly wanted to change the Constitutional structure of the local bodies.
  The memorandum drew the attention of the Governor towards the government's move to abolish the posts of deputy mayors, chairmen of municipality corpora tions/town areas, block pramukhs and gram pradhans. It was signed by Premlata Katiyar, Lallu Singh, Suresh Kumar Srivastava, Nepal Singh, Dr Ramapati Ram Tripathi, Lalji Tandon and Om Prakash Singh.
  It was alleged in the memorandum that the basic structure of the local bodies and other related organisations was created and governed by 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments and it was mandatory for all the state governments to function accordingly.
  The effort of the Mayawati government to abolish hundreds of posts from various local bodies was mainly aimed at getting rid of the local bodies office-bearers who were appointed/elected by the previous Mulayam government.
  The government's game plan was to control the local bodies by appointing people loyal to the BSP on key positions as administrators to indirectly control the local bodies, it was alleged.
  The leaders apprised the Governor of strong resentment among people against the government move to abolish various posts in the local bodies that too by removing duly elected office-bearers.
  The Governor gave a hearing to the delegation and assured that he would look into the matter.

The statement from the High Commissioner for Human Rights followed a visit by Arbour's permanent envoy in the country to the southern town of Gaur, where police have imposed a curfew.
""Our teams confirmed, first hand, the killing of 25 individuals, most of whom died of severe head wounds apparently caused by beatings from bamboo sticks,"" Arbour said.
""I urge the authorities to take all necessary steps to initiate a full and impartial investigation into the killings and other violent incidents, and to hold accountable anyone found to be responsible,"" she added.
Only a small number of law enforcement personnel were deployed to the incidents even though there was a ""considerable"" security presence in the region, the UN rights chief said.
The violence erupted on Wednesday in the town of Gaur, near the border with India. The area is dominated by the Mahadhesi ethnic group, whose activists have staged a series of deadly protests since January.
Officials in Nepal said least 29 people were killed and dozens injured in Wednesday's clashes.
On Thursday, hundreds of Maoists gathered in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, to call for action against the perpetrators of the violence and to demand government compensation.
Arbour cautioned that the incident in Gaur must not be allowed to jeopardise the country's peace process, and called on the leaders of all groups to resolve their differences through dialogue.
Maoist rebels and the central government signed a peace deal four months ago. 
The Maoists have accused King Gyanendra of fomenting ethnic violence in the south to undermine the deal, which is expected to result in Nepal being declared a republic.

 Kathmandu, 4 May: Amidst a climate of political uncertainty, five political parties today launched their joint-movement aimed at ""restoring power to the sovereign people"" which they said King Gyanendra acquired by a royal decree on 4 October which dismissed the government of Sher Bahadur Deuba . The joint show of strength culminated in a rally at the Tundikhel open air theatre which brought supporters in the thousands, some displaying placards and other chanting slogans like ""power to the people"".
 Waving pro-democracy banners, protesters came from around the capital in an orderly manner, ignoring the stepped-up security arrangements by the government. Coming down heavily against the 4 October royal move, leaders of the five political parties unveiled an eight-point, week-long first phase protest programme beginning 8 May.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 5 May 03
The highlights include a 20-minute-long silence on 8 May, boycott of all government functions, holding black flag rallies throughout the country on 9 May, burning the effigy of ""regression"" on 10 May, holding torch rallies on 11 May, nationwide blackouts on 12 May and finally forcibly blocking government vehicles from plying on the streets.
 Today's meeting consisting of Nepali Congress (NC), Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML), People's Front Nepal (PFN), Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party (NWPP) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandi Devi) also declared an 11-point code of conduct to regulate the joint movement. The joint movement will fight for its avowed goals of bringing the Royal Nepal Army under the parliament and ensuring that the government-Maoist peace negotiations ended on a successful note, among others.
 Addressing an impressive gathering, NC President Girija Prasad Koirala declared this was going to be a decisive movement against the 4 October move and warned that it might turn against the king if people continue to be undermined by the palace. ""Palace is the root cause of all the instability that has the beset the nation in the past many years,"" Koirala said, adding, ""This movement is directly targeted against the king and such activities.""…
 Koirala said two parallel trends were taking roots in the country's politics now and the king can choose one from republic or the parliamentary democracy. And king should have no illusion that he is repository of the divine power…
 Similarly, venting anger against the king, CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said that the current joint movement would decide the fate of monarchy. ""A nation can never exist without its people but it can remain without the king,"" he said.
 Nepal proposed that Nepali congress (Democratic) led by Sher Bahadur Deuba also be included in the joint movement in order to consolidate the democratic forces, but there was no immediate endorsement from other constituents of the rally. He also cautioned the Maoists that they might be extending the tenure of the unconstitutional government by procrastinating the peace talks.
 Dwelling on the foreign influence, Nepal said that the Nepalis could resolve all sort of problems by themselves. ""We don't want foreign interference in our country,"" but at the same time advised the king to learn a lesson from history, which is full of instances of peoples' movements not being very kind to the mighty monarchs…

"5762",20072361,"Title: Nepal Maoists stall arms verification over party workers killing.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: June 15, 2007 Friday
Excerpt from report by Rajaram Gautam headlined ""Nepal arms verification process again stalled"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 15 June
Kathmandu, 14 June: Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has stalled the second phase of the Maoist arms and combatants' verification process, demanding action against those responsible for the killings of Maoist party workers. The second phase of the verification of Maoist soldiers was initially scheduled to begin on 27 May this year but could not make headway after the Maoists demanded proper management of the cantonment and salaries for its soldiers from the government before the verification could begin. After assurances from the government that it would provide salaries to the Maoist combatants, the Maoists had agreed to move ahead with the verification process. However, following the killing of Maoist leaders in Saptari [southeastern Nepal] and Rupendehi [western Nepal] this week, the Maoist leadership decided to postpone the verification process for an indefinite period. [Passage omitted: names of Maoist leaders killed and the circumstance under which they were killed]
Following the decision to stall the verification process, which was scheduled to begin on 14 June, the UN Mission in Nepal [UNMIN] chief Ian Martin met Maoist Chairman Prachanda. Stating that the verification process has been stalled due to the Maoists, Martin strongly condemned the killings. After his talks with Prachanda, Martin said that the verification process would resume soon. However, the Maoists have said that the verification process would not resume until those responsible for the killing of its party leaders were brought within the purview of the legal system.
The deputy commander of the Maoist People's Liberation Army, Pasang, said that the verification process would not resume until the government arrested and took action against those responsible for the killings. There has been a consorted conspiracy to kill Maoist leaders, Pasang told Kantipur. There will be no headway until the criminals are brought to books, and appropriate action has to be taken, he said.
The minister for peace and reconstruction, Ram Chandra Paudel, said that the verification process should not be stalled over petty reasons. It is not right to stop the verification process just because there were some violence and killings, he told Kantipur. He also said that he had received assurances from Minister for Information and Communications Krishna Bahadur Mahara that the verification process would not be stalled. But it appears that the process has been postponed after media reports. [Passage omitted: the number of cantonment and soldiers in the Maoist army]
The US ambassador to Nepal, James F Moriarty, has said on 12 June that there were between 6,000 and 9,000 child soldiers in the Maoist temporary camps. On the same day, UNMIN Chief Ian Martin stated that the UNDP and Unicef would be involved in the verification process and child soldiers would be relocated for additional support. He said that those who did not fall under the UN criteria would not be considered Maoist soldiers. [Passage omitted: The UN criteria for Maoist soldiers]

"1886",20043011,"Title: Nepal premier says visit to India yielded significant achievements.rtf; Date: September 12, 2004, Sunday; Text: Text of report on interview with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 12 September
 When Nepal is going through testing times, what has Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba achieved from his India visit? Prime Minister Deuba, after completing all his formal programmes of the visit, talked with chief editor of Nepal Samacharpatra, Pushkar Lal Shrestha. Following are excerpts from the interview:
 Question: Mr Prime Minister, how was the visit?
 Answer: From the viewpoint of strengthening the diplomatic relations between Nepal and India, this visit was highly successful. We had friendly talks and agreements with president, prime minister and others. Both Nepal and India have agreed to solve all the problems between the two countries on an equal footing. So I have seen this as a significant visit. Another important achievement is that we became successful in removing the delusion from the minds of Indian leaders that the Maoists' so-called blockade had devastated Nepal.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 12 Sep 04 p 1
Question: You said the visit was successful. What is the most important achievement?
 Answer: You know that we have made achievements in every sector. But Nepal's main problem is the Maoist problem. And our priority is on holding peace talks and thereby solving the Maoist problem and the government is doing homework for that. But the modality of talks could be different.  To tell you the truth, our past experiences shows that there is no guarantee that the talks will be successful. So keeping in view the people's wishes and national security, it is important to strengthen the security bodies. Apart from this we have made agreements on political and economic development and other bilateral issues. And we have made agreements on culture and sports, laying pipleine from Raxual to Amlekhgunj, metrology and weather forecasting by satellite. These are very important for Nepal. Likewise we hadn't been in better terms on water resources and security issues. There has been an agreement to train the Nepal Police.
 Question: In an interview with US news channel, CNN, you said that you came to India seeking help to resolve the Maoist problem. What help did you get?
 Answer: Our friendly neighbour India has pledged us to help strengthen and modernise the security bodies as per our previous agreement and we expect that will continue in the future. So this is an important help to resolve the Maoist problem.
 Question: On Friday 10 September the Nepalese media reported that India will provide Nepal with two helicopters and arms. Is this true?
 Answer: This is a regular process. This type of agreement was made during my previous visit. Let's not go into details. This help is regular and part of Indian policy to strengthen and modernise Nepalese security bodies.
 Question: Did you talk about UN mediation to solve the Maoist problem?
 Answer: Why should we raise this issue when we have been working to resolve the problem by ourselves? When we are able to do that why should we raise the issue. I hadn't come here to talk this.
 Question: Did you receive any assurance from India to solve the Bhutanese refugee problem?
 Answer: I talked about this with the Indian prime minister. He has said that he would take the issue seriously. Let's hope that the Indian government will make positive efforts to solve the Bhutanese refugee problem.
 Question: There were reports that you asked General Secretary of India's Nationalist Communist Party, Devi Prasad Tripathi, to tell Indian communist parties not to sympathise with Nepalese Maoists, is it true?
 Answer: I am not aware that such reports have appeared in the Indian media. I am surprised to know this. I don't know about this.
 Question: You have encouraged Indian investors to invest in Nepal, but here multinational companies are closing down, how do you think they will be encouraged?
 Answer: The investors should think about this. First of all they have to set up industries. The government is ready to provide them with security. The industrialists should be daring. Either by pressurising the labourers or taking out rallies, they should open the businesses. Also here, I have told the industrialists this. Closure of industries is a violation of the human rights of the labourers. The human rights workers should raise this issue.
 Question: You have talked of holding peace talks with Maoists in India, when will the talks take place?
 Answer: I have always stood for peace. The people know that I was the first to initiate a peace process with the Maoists. So I am again ready to solve the problem through peace talks. But how could the problem be solved when I am alone ready for peace talks? The Maoists also should express commitment to peace talks. If they are ready the government is always ready. They also know that the government has formed a peace committee for the purpose and has done all the necess"

Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, in a letter to Nepalese prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, also urged the government to identify those responsible for the July 27 abduction and murder of Amar Lama.
Lama was a columnist with Tajakhabar, a weekly newspaper published out of Katmandu. He wrote mainly on politics. Police officials said they didn't know why he'd been killed.
He was abducted by three unidentified assailants and later shot dead in the crowded Kirtipur market, about 10 kilometers (six miles) southwest of Katmandu.
Police have arrested at least three suspects and the government has formed an investigation committee headed by a district court judge.
The journalist had served a five-year jail sentence for his involvement in a car accident that killed a high-profile communist leader in 1993.

"7239",20091123,"Title: Copenhagen Shame.rtf; Date: December 20, 2009 Sunday; Text: India, Dec. 20 -- Climate change may be an overwhelming global concern but representatives from 192 countries could not reach a consensus on how to tackle it. The recently concluded summit witnessed multiple alliances and breakups. Working beyond the stipulated time, the US-led group of five nations including China, India, Brazil and South Africa tabled a last minute proposal to limit temperature rises to less than two degrees celsius. US President Barack Obama hailed the agreement as ""meaningful"" only to be rejected by developing nations.
Addressing the crucial final day of the summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a galaxy of world leaders who had gathered to seal a climate deal in the Danish capital, ""We can do even more if a supporting global climate regime is in place.""
The path ahead does not seem easy for anyone. Climate change remains a threat for developed and developing countries alike. None of the developing countries have enough resources to invest in climate friendly technology.
Copenhagen was a huge opportunity for India to take the lead on the world stage. Time and again, it has been labeled a deal-breaker with an obstinate negotiating stance. Interestingly, this rigid stand has been for India's own good. The recent announcement in Parliament by Environment and Forest Minister Jairam Ramesh agreeing to a drastic cut (20-25 per cent) in carbon intensity would be apocalyptic for India's well being. It amounts to taking upon ourselves the task of redefining the adage ""Polluter must pay"" to ""Polluter must get away"".
Carbon cuts seem to be the sole mantra of the elite world capitals. Around the world, countries have been involved in a one-of-its-kind rat race with comments and commitments about emission cuts or reduction in emission intensity as their claim to fame. Ahead of the submit, RK Pachauri, Chairman, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Director General, Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) said ""this is negotiation season"".
If India has resisted legally binding emission cuts it is for good reason. ""Agreeing to a specific percentage in emission cuts will prove to be a poor strategy for India. The developed countries would donate a few millions and get away with what they have done. What is important is that they agree to emission cuts as a matter of principle,"" Murli Manohar Joshi, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and part of the Indian delegation at Copenhagen said.
India need not succumb to offering unilateral concessions without obtaining any reciprocity. For this reason the operative part of the Indian delegation as voiced by the Prime Minister himself was to respect the right to development for its people keeping the per capita principle as the base. Eventually, for India, the tussle was to succeed in getting an agreement for funding and technology transfer for nationally appropriate mitigation action to counter climate change.
The 192 countries coming together at the Danish capital needed to know that the poor in India are already victims of climate change. It is common knowledge in India today that our monsoons are getting erratic and less predictable. Monsoons are the sole driving force of the agriculture-based economy. When it rains it pours, destroying crops, followed by months of water scarcity. The Indian Government needs to put its act together for a blue print of a bypass that is moral, politically feasible and economically responsible for a vast nation like ours with various climate zones.
Speaking to The Pioneer, member of the Indian delegation at Copenhagen, Chandrashekhar Dasgupta says, ""Legally binding emission cuts with population as a determining key factor is not for India. It is like saying that India should stop consuming calories because it has a huge population. The negotiations at the summit have to honour the per capita principle that each inhabitant of this planet is entitled to.""
The United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC) adopted in 1992 was formulated to stabilise the green house gases (GHG). The buildup of GHG emissions was due to the developed countries and it is their historical responsibility to cut down on the emissions. The Kyoto Protocol (KP) is the first legally binding commitment that makes developed countries adhere to 5.2 per cent cut in GHG emissions at the global level.
When the KP was adopted in 1997 the US was not party to it. The protocol prescribed a reduction in the level of green house gases to 5.2 per cent lower than the 1990 level between 2008 and 2012. Copenhagen was to decide a future course of action after the KP expires in 2012 for continuity of the process of cutting GHGs and honour the commitment made by 154 countries in the UNFCC. The decision needs to be taken in 2009 so that there is no hiatus between the two commitment periods.
Even before the summit commenced scientists were apprehensive that negotiations to cut carbon will yield desired results. ""We expected surprises in"

  What has complicated the matter is that many agencies are themselves involved in trafficking and there is no surveillance on their activities. Adding to that is the fact that many helps are from Bangladesh and Nepal, making background verification difficult.
  ""The only solution is that everyone should insist on verification. There is no regulation to monitor the placement agencies as of now. Majority of the problems will be taken care of if employees insist on servant verification. Someone who has a wrong intention will not agree to fill the form in the first place,"" said Rajan Bhagat, Delhi Police spokesman.
  According to the police, the servant should be in the know that the local police have all information on him and his family. ""It will act as a deterrent because the servant will know that he/she can get caught if something goes wrong,"" added Bhagat.
  Another suggestion is verification of the placement agency be made mandatory.
  Owners of the placement agency, however, do not agree. ""We send maids and helps to employees only after we are certain about their background. These are not people who have been trafficked. Our verification will achieve nothing as the servant is the one responsible for his actions. When client specifically ask for verification, we get it done,"" said Raju, who runs a placement agency.

"513",20031387,"Title: India urges parliamentarians to join fight against AIDS in Asia.rtf; Date: August 1, 2003 Friday; Text: An international meet on AIDS in South and Southeast Asia called Friday for greater commitment from politicians to fight the disease, warning that HIV could spiral out of control if urgent measures are not taken.
UN experts called on Asian nations to step up their surveillance of HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, saying a lack of reliable data was compounding the difficulty in forming strategies against the disease.
Indian Parliament Speaker Manohar Joshi issued a call to MPs to team up with health workers battling AIDS, dubbing the disease ""a catastrophe in slow motion.""
""In Asia the window of opportunity for bringing the HIV/AIDS epidemic under control is narrowing rapidly. … Both India and China are experiencing serious epidemics that are affecting many millions of people,"" Joshi said at the start of the two-day, 14-nation conference.
""The warnings have also been sounded in other South Asian and Southeast Asian countries of the potential that exists for a rapid escalation of the disease if immediate measures are not taken,"" he said.
Joshi's warning came on the back of an announcement last month that 4.58 million Indians were living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 2002 -- a leap over the figure of 3.97 million the previous year.
A recent US government study estimated the number of Indians with the virus could reach 25 million by 2010 if New Delhi did not wake up.
The Indian parliament speaker said the fight against HIV/AIDS was ""no longer merely a policy issue.""
""I make a special appeal to parliamentarians who have a central role in making partnerships at national, regional and global levels for HIV-related health work in a meaningful way,"" Joshi said.
""In view of their status and the nature of their responsibilities, elected representatives are in a better position to sensitize decision-makers, planners and those responsible for implementation of the programme,"" he said.
International delegates, however, appeared cynical of the statistics given out by countries in South Asia, which represent a third of the world's work force.
""The data is scant, the data does not actually reflect what actually exists because the surveillance system is really not covering the whole population,"" said Emelia Timpo, an expert at UNAIDS, the joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS.
""But now that is an area where most South Asian countries are working on for a better grasp of the data and to be able to target intervention to their relevant populations,"" she said.
Timpo said HIV/AIDS data in Bangladesh was based on a 1993 count while Nepal was estimated to have roughly 60,000 infected people but had only 2,598 detected cases.
Suman Mehta, global HIV/AIDS coordinator of the United Nations Population Fund, warned South and Southeast Asia could follow in the footsteps of AIDS-crippled southern African nations.
""The picture has changed dramatically,"" she said, and urged parliamentarians to take time off from politics to forge strategies against the disease.
""Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Nepal and Vietnam have registered marked increases in HIV infection last year. China is on the brink of a widespread AIDS epidemic. In India the figures are also daunting,"" she said, blaming the rise on poorly funded anti-AIDS programmes.
Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, chief of India's National AIDS Control Organisation which is tasked with fighting the disease among the country's billion-plus population, said AIDS ""must become everybody's business.""
""We need parliamentarians. We need business leaders, we need faith-leaders and opinion-makers, governments, national programmes and civil societies across the border otherwise AIDS will take over the business of everybody,"" she said.

 Press Statement
 It is already known to everybody that the domestic reactionaries who have been protected by imperialists and expansionists for centuries have been forcing an unjust war - against the desire of Nepali people for peace, independence and change. It is to end this unjust war that has been forced on the people - against their desire for peace - by the old regime that we have been leading the people's just war for the past nine years.  Forget about the old regime's ability to make the people fully sovereign. Its capacity to do has already been made clear by its inability to provide a clear and concrete answer to the six questions we put to remove the serious doubts that the people and the country may have had because of its monotonous ranting about peace and dialogue. The fact that the old regime has been taking more military assistance from imperialists and expansionists, and murdering people and creating terror throughout the country in the name of artificial clashes, shows that it is not geared towards actual dialogue and peace, but instead it is clear that it is using them as bogus propaganda to prepare itself for a vicious war.

 Through this statement we call on all the party rank and file, the People's Liberation Army and all other people's party organizations to remain fully alert against any possible treachery, betrayal, dishonesty and ruthlessness of the scheming reactionary regime, and to refrain from carrying out any offensive military activities, but remain in active defence.

"3856",20053681,"Title: Nepal police arrest 87 journalists demanding press freedom.rtf; Date: September 16, 2005 Friday; Text: Police arrested 87 journalists as they gathered Friday to protest media restrictions in Nepal while thousands of pro-democracy activists demonstrated elsewhere in the city to demand an end to absolute royal rule. About 200 of those protesters were also arrested.
The arrests came amid an often-violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the capital and underscored rising tensions in the Himalayan kingdom, which is beset by a long-running communist insurgency.
Police arrested the journalists as they prepared to hold a rally to demand the lifting of restrictions on the press and freedom for some half-dozen reporters jailed for critical writings against the government. The restrictions were imposed by the royal government after Gyanendra took over absolute power earlier this year.
""We were gathering for a peaceful rally, but the government used the police to break it up,"" Bishnu Nisthuri, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, a press-rights umbrella group, told The Associated Press by telephone from a Katmandu detention center. Nisthuri was among those arrested, but his cell phone was not confiscated.
The journalists had planned to hold their rally at Ratna Park, an area in the center of Katmandu where protests and rallies have been banned by the government.
Police arrested the journalists when they showed up. There were no reports of violence or scuffling.
Media rights groups demanded the detained journalists be freed.
""We condemn the attack on a peaceful protest. We demand the government immediately release the journalists and stop restrictions on the media,"" said Rishi Dhamala of Reporters Club Nepal.
Since King Gyanendra seized absolute power Feb. 1, many streets near the palace complex and the main government offices in other parts of Katmandu have become restricted areas where demonstrations are not allowed.
Officials at the Home Ministry, which has authority over the police and civil administration, could not be reached for comment. Police officials at the scene said they had orders not to allow any protests in the restricted area.
Journalists have been holding protests to pressure the government to restore press freedoms and end harassment and arrests by government security forces.
Since Gyanendra's seizure of power, criticism of the king, the government and security forces has been banned, along with any independent reporting on the country's communist insurgency. Journalists must get all of their information on security issues from the army or police.
Dozens of reporters have been arrested since the king took power, and six are believed to still be behind bars.
The other protest, which wasn't connected to the journalists' rally, was organized by Nepal's seven major political parties to demand the restoration of democracy.
About 5,000 protesters chanted anti-government slogans in the rally. Police fired a few rounds of tear gas at the crowd, but there were no reports of demonstrators being beaten.
Pro-democracy protesters have held daily rallies in Katmandu over the past week. Hundreds have been arrested at each protest. Until the past few days, demonstrators were often beaten by police.
The seven major political parties have vowed to continue their protests until the king gives up power and restores democracy.
The monarch said he was compelled to assume power to quell a communist insurgency, which has claimed more than 11,500 lives in nine years, and to end government corruption.

The Election Constituency Recommendation Commission handed a report to Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala seeking to increase the number of constituencies during elections planned for June this year.
""The government is committed to enforce the recommendations presented by the commission,"" Koirala said after taking the report.
There are currently 205 constituencies in Nepal electing the same number of representatives in the national legislature.
Details of the report were not made public but news reports said the commission recommended the number of seats be increased to 240, with most of the proposed new constituencies in the southern region.
Increasing the number of representatives in the national legislature has been one of the key demands of ethnic minority groups in southern Nepal who have been organizing protests, general strikes and transport shut downs to press their demands.
They claim the southern region has been sidelined in favor of the more populated mountainous areas in the north.
The protests resulted in violence that claimed about 60 lives earlier this year.
The commission, comprising a former supreme court judge, legal experts and former bureaucrats, was set up by the government following the violent clashes.
Elections for the Constituency Assembly are planned for June 20 when a special assembly will be elected that will rewrite the constitution and determine the future political system of this Himalayan nation.

The cabinet met to discuss claims of harassment by the Maoists -- which the rebels cited as reasons behind closing their public relations office in the capital Kathmandu on Sunday.
""We reviewed the current political situation and the proposed peace dialogues with the Maoists,"" official government spokesman and Minister for Information and Communications Kamal Thapa told AFP.
""The government is fully committed to the security and safety of the Maoist peace negotiators,"" added Thapa, also part of the government negotiating team.
""As per the international norms, we will provide free and safe passage to the Maoist peace negotiators even if the talks fail,"" Thapa said.
The secretary of the Maoists' public relations office, Bharat Dhungana, said in a statement Sunday the office was to be closed immediately because of ""harassment.""
Dhungana said he was ""kidnapped"" then tortured by security agents in Kathmandu last week.
The rebels also said they were closing the offices of their affiliates, including the All Nepal National Free Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU-R).
Maoist senior activists, trade union leaders and students leaders, meanwhile, have all gone into hiding.
The government and the rebels have held six rounds of informal talks in the past six weeks in a bid to resolve disputes holding up negotiations to end the seven-year conflict, but have made little headway.
The rebels and the government declared a ceasefire in January, halting the insurgency that has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
They have held two sessions of official talks but the last was more than two months ago and no date has been fixed for a third.

The rebels have threatened to increase attacks in the run-up to Wednesday's local polls, which King Gyanendra's government insists would go ahead despite claims the elections are aimed at justifying his seizure of power.
While Kathmandu was calm Monday, in the western district of Kailali a bomb blast killed one police officer and wounded four others.
""A bomb went off while they were trying to clear a roadblock,"" said an officer on condition of anonymity.
Suspected Maoists also shot dead a taxi driver in the town of Lalitpur in the Kathmandu Valley on Monday evening, a police officer said, also asking not to be named.
The latest violence came as most shops were shuttered in the capital Kathmandu, after the beginning of the strike on Sunday brought towns across the Himalayan kingdom to a standstill.
The Maoists, who want to turn the poverty-stricken nation into a communist state, called the week-long strike to disrupt Wednesday's elections.
Few vehicles were out on the roads Monday, and many that were covered up their registration plates to prevent identification. Extra police were posted at major intersections and riot police drove through the city.
The strike also badly hit the important southwest regional centre of Nepalgunj near the border with India, according to Bhola Mohat, regional coordinator for human rights group Informal Sector Service Centre in the town.
""Today the strike is very effective. There are no civilian vehicles on the road, only rickshaws,"" said Mohat.
""There are lots of security force (members) moving in vehicles. Only medical shops are open, all the rest are closed. Schools are closed too.""
Political analyst and president of the Nepal Press Institute, Dhruba Adhikary, said the strike had so far been successful.
""They have created the kind of impact that they intended. If there were no vehicles commandeered by the government and forced to ply the roads, the situation would have been more difficult.""
Media reports at the weekend said the government had commandeered around 500 private vehicles to break the strike.
Meanwhile, the army said in a statement that three Maoists had been killed in separate incidents since Saturday. Two blew themselves up when making bombs, while a third was killed in far west Nepal during ""security actions,"" it said.
Around 12,500 people have been killed since 1996 when the Maoist rebels launched their uprising to topple the monarchy.
The country has been facing political uncertainty since last February, when Gyanendra sacked the government, saying it had not done enough to quell the insurgency. He then took over full political power.
Nepal's opposition parties have since formed a loose alliance with the Maoists, in a move that has isolated the king, the world's last Hindu monarch.
Wednesday's election is part of Gyanendra's ""roadmap"" to democracy, which includes national elections before April 2007.
But the polls have been branded a sham by opposition parties, and are seen as a way for the king to place allies in local positions before the national vote.
The rebels are thought to have already killed two candidates in the polls, and elections will only be taking place in 36 of Nepal's 58 municipalities because of a dearth of candidates.
In 22 municipalities local officials have already been appointed, ahead of election day.

The dropping of the arrest warrants was a key part of a deal thrashed out between the Maoists and the Nepalese government that led to a mutual ceasefire deal on January 29.
The Maoists have been waging a ""people's war"" in Nepal since 1996 in a bid to establish a socialist republic in the mountain kingdom. The brutal rebellion has claimed some 7,800 lives.
A police official, who would not be named, said Interpol had issued notification that the Red Corner notices had been withdrawn at the request of the Nepalese government.
Among those who faced arrest warrants were Maoist party chief coordinator Babu Ram Bhattarai. One of the 17, Rit Bahadur Khadka, was killed in a clash with the army.
The dropping of the Red Corner noticies was designed to create a climate conducive to peace talks between the government and rebels.
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand has confirmed the arrest warrants had been dropped, according to state-run radio Tuesday.
It quoted the prime minister as saying peace talks were expected to begin in the near future, although he gave no time frame.

There was a discrepancy about how many people were in the van. State police said six people were in the van, while Bowling Green spokeswoman Teri Sharp said it had seven passengers.
The group was returning to Ohio from a trip to Chicago over the holiday break, Sharp said.
""Our thoughts and prayers are with them, with the other five students involved in the accident, and with our international community in this time of sadness,"" school president Sidney Ribeau said in a statement.
While the road was snowy when the crash happened about 12:20 a.m., Trooper Eric Gilliam said police could not say whether the weather had contributed to the crash. An investigation was under way, he said.
All the van's occupants were in their mid-20s.

 Damak east Nepal , 20 May: Bhutanese Refugee Representatives Committee (BRRC) has criticized the United Nations and western donors for not putting pressure on Bhutan to stop repression of people in southern Bhutan.
 BRRC's President S.B. Subba, who recently returned after a visiting bordering areas in southern Bhutan told Spacetime, "" Twenty-two thousand 22,000 Nepali speaking children in southern Bhutan were prevented by the government from attending schools in southern Bhutan this year. It has been 10 years since Bhutan stopped providing citizenship certificates and no objection certificates to Nepalis. But those things are necessary even to travel on government transport today.""
Spacetime, Kathmandu, in English 21 May 04, p 4
In addition, Bhutanese government has prevented Nepalis from carrying out their fundamental rights of citizens such as open businesses or join government services for the past 11 years. But the western donors have nothing to say about this and the repression is continuing even as they providing financial support for projects like drinking water and health. More than two and half dozen organization such as the UNICEF, World Health Organization, European Union and donors from Scandinavia, US and some Asian countries are funding Bhutan's drive towards modernization.
 The BRRC on behalf of Bhutanese refugees taking shelter in Nepal, has written several letters to these organizations asking them to exert pressure on the Bhutanese government. However, the donor agencies have so far turned deaf ears to the demands of the refugees. ""We are not satisfied with the role of donor agencies,"" Subba said.
 Subba expressed concerns that the organizations have not even spoken about the children who have been denied their right to education. He further said: ""By denying the children their right to study, the Bhutanese government has shamefully pushed one aspect of human rights to stone age. The loans provided by the western community for education and health related programmes are being used for militarization and repression of the people.""
 Lately, the Bhutanese government has imposed a ban on people of Samdupjokhar and Sarbhang as written districts in southern Bhutan to cross into Indian territory. After the government enforced the ban in mid January, there is growing shortage of essential items such as salt, edible oil, kerosene and clothes.  passage omitted: Bhutan said the ban was imposed to control Indian terrorists activities.

Nepalgunj [mid-west Nepal], 1 January: Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Keshar Bahadur Bista has described the seven political parties as the kin of Maoists because of their agreement with the rebels. 
Bista said that the parties would be treated just like the Maoists.
Talking to reporters in Nepalgunj on Sunday [1 January], he said: ""The seven parties have become the most junior brothers of the Maoists."" In reply to journalists' questions, he said that the parties would be treated like the Maoists, but did not elaborate.
Holding elections is only the way to strengthen democracy, Bista said. But if the major political parties do not participate in the election, it will have no meaning. It is regrettable that the major parties are staying out of the election process. They must join the election, he said.
While placing the parties on an equal footing to the Maoists, however, the minister also highlighted the role of the parties. ""Something that came about through Article 127 of the constitution should get an outlet through the same article,"" said Bista. For that to happen, a election is inevitable.

The study clearly indicates the alarming threat posed by pesticide residue present in the food consumed by Valley residents.
Among the diets studied, green-leafy vegetable samples from retail stores in Lalitpur, vegetables from retail stores in Bhaktapur, and samples of rice, pulses and vegetables from Kathmandu were found containing high level of pesticide residue. According to the DFTQC, 15 food samples were taken from different locations based on the local food consumption pattern.
""None of the samples were free from pesticide contamination. They were contaminated with one or the other of the 10 varieties of pesticides,"" the report revealed.
The study was undertaken using the tool of Total Diet Study (TDS) to evaluate the risks posed by food contaminated with pesticide. The detected pesticides were endosulfan, chlorpyriphos, malathion, parathion-methyl, and profenophos. Similarly, cypermethrin, fenvalerate (RR+Ss), lambada-cyhalothrin and permethrin were also found in most of the food samples.
""Parathion-methyl and cypermethrin were the most common pesticides found in almost all food samples,"" the report further says.
In recent years, pesticide use has incresed markedly across the country. Endosulfan is used to give a polished appearance to vegetables like tomato, brinjal, and mustard leaves. A blend of pesticides is also applied on different vegetables and tea. Some insecticides are applied on the fish to keep flies away during display at shops.
""This is the pilot study conducted only in the Kathmandu Valley. We are planning to conduct a massive awareness program across the country,"" Director General of DFTQC Jiwan Prabha Lama, said. ""The pesticides found in the food we consume are hazardous to human health."" She also said that DFTQC will conduct national-level survey in the near future.
The improper and excessive use of pesticide is dangeous to the health of consumers. It may lead to acute food poisoning with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness, the report says. In severe cases, the victim may even have difficulties in breathing, blurred vision and convulsion. Prolonged consumption of vegetables with excessive pesticides may also damage the nervous system or other organs such as liver and kidneys. Some pesticides may be transferred unknowingly to infants through breast milk thereby affecting development of the baby.
The samples tested by DFTQC were further analyzed at Vimta Lab, Hyderabad, India. The food samples were analyzed for 97 types of pesticides as per the EU protocol for pesticide residues in foods.
According to the DFTQC, the main purpose of the study is to protect diets from chemical contaminants by monitoring exposure levels to the general population over time. The report further says that improper use, more importantly use of banned pesticides, is one of the key problems affecting the health of Nepali consumers.

 Kathmandu, 22 June: The Rashtriya Prajatantra Party RPP has rejected the proposal of the CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) that the seats secured in the 1999 general elections be made the basis for joining the government. During a meeting held at the RPP's office in Kamalpokhari Kathmandu Tuesday 22 June , the CPN-UML argued that the power-sharing should be done on the basis of seats secured in the dissolved parliament.
 But the RPP took the stand that the 1999 elections cannot control power-sharing and that the three parties Nepali Congress (Democratic), RPP and CPN-UML must share the ministerial berths proportionately. These issues were raised during the meeting of the task forces of both parties formed to chart a ""common minimum programme"" for joining the government.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 23 Jun 04, p1
CPN-UML leader Bam Dev Gautam argued that the best determining factor in power-sharing will be the results of the last general elections. But Assistant General Secretary of the RPP Khem Raj Pandit rejected the proposal outright. ""What was their leaders' status earlier? This cut-off point is not practical,"" a leader told ""Rajdhani"", quoting Pandit. ""Even if we take the last elections as the standard point, the prime minister's party is yet to contest elections. How can the votes of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) headed by the prime minister be determined?""
 The RPP task force claimed that it had helped remove the Surya Bahadur Thapa government, and had thus paved the way for a multi-party government. So it demanded that justifiable standards be set for power-sharing. The RPP added that the party has incurred heavy losses for its efforts.
 Although the standards for joining the government could not he finalised, the CPN-UML had dropped the demand for reinstatement of local bodies. The RPP argued that the spirit of multi-party government should trickle down to the grassroots level as well. In response, the CPN-UML said that it would not make an issue out of the reinstatement of local bodies. Even as it agreed to drop the demand, it reiterated that the revival of local bodies was the best option.  passage omitted

Text of report by Dikshya Thakuri by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 3 April
Kathmandu, 2 April: A human rights defender today said conflict-related psychological problems are affecting the security forces. Increasing instances of indiscriminate firing by the security forces killing civilians, including a National Human Rights Commission [NHRC] staffer, according to him, are the most obvious examples. 
Some security personnel are facing psychological problems and trauma owing to the conflict-related stress and mounting pressure, Subodh Pyakurel, chairman of the Informal Sector Service Centre [INSEC], told this daily. Indiscriminate firings by the security forces in Nagarkot, Ilam and Janakpur, which have killed civilians and a NHRC staffer, clearly reflect their psychological problems, he said. 
""The security forces need to address the problems through psychological trauma counselling and medical treatment,"" said Pyakurel. Punishing human rights violators through court martial alone is not enough. 
A high-ranking Royal Nepalese Army officer admitted there are negligible cases of psychological problems in the army but said they had nothing to do with the conflict. 
""We have few individual cases of mental problems and we offer medical treatment, training and counselling to the patients,"" the officer said, requesting anonymity. He said the RNA personnel have never been involved in indiscriminate killings and that 155 human rights violator RNA personnel have been brought to book. 
Brig-Gen B.A. Kumar Sharma, chief of the RNA legal unit said: ""We do not have RNA personnel suffering from conflict-related psychological problems. Few individual and personal cases cannot be generalized as an institutional problem."" 
The number of deaths related with the conflict has already crossed the 13,000 mark. Over 13,190 conflict-related deaths have been recorded by the INSEC from 13 February 1996 to 12 March 2006, of which state was responsible for 8,457 killings and the Maoists were responsible for 4,733. Data showed an average of 4.10 individuals were killed every day from 1 February 2005 [i.e. when the king assumed full powers] to 12 March 2006

    On Wednesday, the mission also handed over to Annan letters  from both the government and the guerrillas asking UN assistance  in Nepal's peace process, the radio quoted the UN office here in  the capital as saying.
    The letters were submitted separately to the acting chief of  the UN system in Nepal Abraham at the Peace Secretariat in  Kathmandu on Wednesday after the government and the guerrilla  reached a 5-point agreement.
    The letters addressed to the UN Secretary General seeks UN  assistance to monitor and manage the arms and the armies of the  guerrillas and the Nepal Army, monitor cease-fire code of conduct, monitor human rights situation and observe and monitor constituent assembly elections.
    The two separate letters to UN, one undersigned by Prime  Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and the other by guerrilla top  leader Prachanda, had the same contents.
    ""We received two letters. Both have agreed on a 5-point pact  requesting the UN to get involved in the electoral process, in the arms management which means containment of both the combatants and the army, and in the monitoring of the cease-fire and human rights, "" Mistura said on Wednesday in New York when talking to reporters.
    Mistura also said that he was ""strongly encouraged"" by the  requests, particularly by both sides' request to the UN to assist  in the best way possible to proceed on the ""most delicate aspect""  of arms management. ""The good news is everybody wants the UN to be involved, everybody wants the UN to assist the peace process which is potentially fragile and should not be allowed to be kept  fragile,"" he said.
    Mistura, who recently was UN's deputy envoy to Iraq, spent a  week in Nepal, meeting with government officials, guerrilla  leaders and civilians. The High Level UN team led by Mistura that  was in Nepal on a ""study visit"" last week had extended the "" deadline"" for submitting the letter to the UN till Wednesday as  the two sides were unable to reach a consensus during its visit.
    Meanwhile, the Nepali government hopped the next UN team will  arrive soon and it will provide the needed assistance.
    ""The peace process will now move ahead smoothly and we believe  we will be successful in holding the Constituent Assembly  elections in a free and fair manner,"" Krishna Prashad Sitaula,  home minister, said while commenting about the letter sent to UN.
    Likewise, coordinator of the guerrilla talks team Krishna  Bahadur Mahara said, ""All the confusions have been cleared as we  have agreed upon an issue that holds a long-term impact.
    ""The 5-point joint letter is a historic step in the peace  process,"" Mahara added.
    Similarly, Leaders of various political parties have also  described the letter to the UN by the government and the guerrilla asking the world body's assistance in Nepal's peace process a  positive step toward restoring peace in the country.
    Speaking at an interaction, they said that though the letters  is not a complete document for the arms management, it has been  able to resolve differences between the guerrilla and the  government.
    Vice-Chairman of People's Front Nepal Lila Mani Pokhrel said  that political settlement is the crucial point for arms management, adding that decommissioning of the guerrilla's army is not  possible as the ruling Seven Party Alliance and the guerrilla  agreed to give equal status to both armies.
    He said the political forces of the country should move towards holding elections of the Constituent Assembly rather than dispute  in minor things and be involved in the day-to-day activities of  the parliament.
    Ram Chandra Poudel, General Secretary of Nepali Congress, said  that the agreement has paved the way for moving ahead, leaving the minor differences.
    He however urged the guerrilla to join the politics of  competition leaving the politics of power and weapons as agreed in various agreements reached between political parties and the  guerrilla.

""The peace process had found no favor of the U.S. from the very start in November last year. Now the U.S. is trying to disrupt it,"" Prachanda told Nepal Television in an interview aired Saturday evening.
U.S. Ambassador to Nepal James Moriarty is acting as an agent provocateur, he said.
Earlier Saturday, Moriarty said U.S. aid to cash-strapped Nepal would be halted if the Maoists join a proposed interim government without settling the issue of weapons management.
Washington insists that the rebels renounce violence and dismantle their war machine before participating in any government.
The rebels in November signed a pact with an alliance of seven mainstream political parties pledging to join the political mainstream by ending their decade-old insurgency.
Prachanda criticized what he described as mistrust and suspicion expressed by foreign envoys against the insurgents' intentions and overtures for peaceful resolution of violence-plagued Nepal.
The insurgent leader said he is only eager to meet and talk with Moriarty for ""clarifying the misunderstanding.""
In remarks to the press earlier in the week, the U.S. envoy, however, said the Nepalese guerrillas are still on the U.S. watch list of terrorists, and that he would be constrained to personally meet them.

 Kathmandu, 18 July: The INSAS Indian National Small Arms System rifles purchased from India on a partial grant basis have appeared faulty while being used. A security as received says the weapons imported in large quantities have not performed as expected.
 When Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was in office the last time, weapons were imported from Belgium and the United States.  passage omitted: names of weapons But after pressure from India it was decided that the INSAS rifles would be bought from India. According to the source, its performance has not been up to expectation.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 Jul 04
According to the source 15,000 INSAS rifles have been imported so far on the partial grant basis. Preparations are under way for the import of a further 10,000 rifles. The source claims, the agreement reached around mid May 2004 with India was also for the import of the INSAS rifles. India banned the flight of the aircraft carrying the Belgian weapons over its airspace to put pressure on Nepal and the aircraft remained in Kazakastan for three days. Later the Indians agreed to let the aircraft use its airspace after special requests were made.
 According to the source, soon after the purchase of weapons from Belgium and the United States, the then Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes telephoned the then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and expressed dissatisfaction at the purchases and said the Indian INSAS rifles were modern, reliable and cheaper.
 The source says the Indian INSAS rifles were imported only because of pressure from India. There has been no official agreement with India on this. These weapons have been included in the Indian defence aid package. A security official said, ""we don't have to ask for the INSAS weapons, they include it in the security package"". He said it was not easy to tell India, we do not want the INSAS rifles, because it is supplying us many kinds of aid including helicopters.
 But another high ranking military officer said, the INSAS rifles have their own importance when the Americans were not supplying enough of the M16 A2 rifles. He said, ""although it could not be compared with the M16, it was much better than the old SLRs. The source claims, the INSAS weapons which failed in the early tests have not been in full use in the Indian military itself"".

 Although it was said these rifles would replace other weapons as part of the modernization of the Indian military, it has been stopped because of faults seen during tests.  passage omitted: technical details of the INSAS weapons

Powell, notorious for not including relaxation time in his frequent trips abroad, flew to this once-flourishing Jordanian city for a guided tour of ruins dating from the 1st century B.C.
One of the few exceptions to Powell's all-business approach to foreign travel was a brief tour last year to a Hindu monastery in Katmandu, Nepal.
Saturday morning, Powell boarded a helicopter in the Dead Sea resort town of South Shuneh and headed south, passing over barren, adobe-hued hills and plains.
On arrival 45 minutes later in Petra, Powell and his traveling party boarded a 10-vehicle caravan for the short drive to the outskirts of the area that two millennia ago was the center of the thriving Nabatean culture.
Wearing a red polo shirt, a souvenir from a Wednesday visit to Bangladesh, Powell walked through a walkway flanked by a tan-and-pink rock formation extending higher than 30 feet (9 meters) up.
His guide was Pierre Bikai, a Lebanese-American archaeologist who is an Amman-based researcher financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Powell viewed the remains of one of several Byzantine churches and made a brief visit inside.
His black shoes sporting a layer of dust, Powell ascended a stone-strewn 100-foot ( 30-meter) hill and gazed at several temples off in the distance.
Aside from tourists, there were few signs of life in the immediate area: an occasional Bedouin could be seen with camels lying placidly in the summer sun.
Petra was the principal city of ancient Nabatea; a devastating earthquake leveled half the city in A.D. 363.
After two hours, Powell's tour was over. He pronounced the site very impressive.
He was back at his Dead Sea hotel and soon was getting ready for a luncheon in Amman hosted by King Abdullah II. Also scheduled was an afternoon meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a dinner in honor of Powell and other delegates attending the World Economic Forum in South Shuneh.

The attack occurred in the southern city of Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban movement that has waged an increasingly fierce insurgency against targets including civilians since being ousted in 2001.
""Four Nepalese and an Afghan who were working for the UN security services were killed in a very powerful remote-controlled explosion,"" Kandahar province police chief Esmatullah Alizai told AFP.
The bomb almost completely destroyed the armoured UN vehicle and its smoking wreckage lay across a road near the centre of the city. Police were trying to remove two bodies trapped inside, an AFP reporter witnessed.
""We're investigating what type of explosive was used. It was a very powerful blast,"" Afghan interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Basharay said while confirming five people had died in the blast.
UN spokesman Aleem Siddique said there was a ""roadside bomb explosion against a UNOPS (UN Office for Project Services) convoy which was travelling to its base in Kandahar"" but had no details of casualties.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but previous blasts have been blamed on the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban militia.
Meanwhile, four Afghan employees of a US-owned private security firm were killed by a motorcycle-borne suicide bomber on Sunday at Kandahar airfield, a base for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
Human Rights Watch said in a report published Monday that civilian deaths from ""war crimes"" and other attacks by Taliban-led insurgents have soared in the past 15 months.
At least 669 Afghan civilians had died since the start of 2006, the report said.
A would-be suicide bomber wearing an explosives-filled vest was detained on Monday night in the eastern city of Khost, where eight policemen were killed in a powerful suicide blast on Saturday, Khost police chief Mohammad Ayoob said.
Separately, four children died and five others were injured when a round of ammunition which appeared to be left over from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan exploded in a school in the western city of Herat, police said.
""There was an explosion in a school. Four students were killed and five others were injured,"" Herat police chief Mohammad Shafiq Fazli told AFP.
""It's quite likely that it was an old round left over from the old times,"" he said, adding the school had previously served as a military barracks.

Hours before the king's departure, three policemen and a civilian were killed and five policemen injured in a bomb blast in southeast Nepal that police blamed on Maoist guerrillas.
The blast followed an army statement Tuesday that 22 rebels and three soldiers had died in clashes in Maoist-dominated west Nepal.
""The visit will ""help Nepal muster international support,"" Nepal Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said this week.
""He will explain to the world the reasons for his political actions that are to control Maoist terrorists,"" another foreign ministry official said.
Before leaving, the king put his son, Crown Prince Paras whose hard-living  reputation has raised eyebrows in the kingdom in the past, in charge of the nation.
Maoist rebels have been battling since 1996 to install a communist republic in a conflict that has claimed over 11,000 lives.
World powers, apart from China and Pakistan which have called the upheaval  in Nepal an internal matter, have largely cold-shouldered Gyanendra since his  takeover of power.
Nepal's longstanding ally and major trading partner India has suspended military aid to the kingdom along with Britain and the United States has threatened to follow suit.
The king is participating in the Asia-Africa summit at the invitation of the summit co-chairmen, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and South African President Thabo Mbeki.
After the Jakarta summit, mainly expected to focus on building economic links between the two resource-rich continents, Gyanendra will head to China's Hainan province to attend the Asian economic conference at Boao.
He will meet Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the two conferences in what analysts say reflects a warming of relations with Beijing.

"6991",2008550,"Title: Forensic expert says she was told to blame Serbs for Racak killings.rtf; Date: October 22, 2008 Wednesday 5:00 PM GMT; Text: A Finnish forensic expert charged in a recent book that the former OSCE chief in Kosovo told her to blame Serbian forces for the 1999 killing of Kosovo Albanians in Racak.
The former head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Kosovo monitoring mission, William Walker ""wanted me to say the Serbs were behind (the killings) so the war could begin,"" professor Helena Ranta confided in a biography of her published in Finland last week. 
""I was not going to do that because I am just an investigator,"" she added.
In the book, titled ""Helena Ranta, Human Mark"" and written by Kaius Niemi, Ranta described how she met with Walker, a US diplomat monitoring a Kosovo ceasefire for the OSCE, before a press conference in Pristina in early 1999. 
""Walker got really mad when I said I would stick to the conclusions of the report. He crushed pencils in his hands and threw them on the table, at me."" 
Ranta's forensic team, which was invited to Kosovo by Yugoslavian authorities and the international community, concluded in its report that there was no evidence the around 45 Kosovo Albanians killed in the central Kosovo village of Racak in January 1999 had been members of Kosovo Liberation Army, UCK.
The report also refused to describe the killings in Racak as a massacre because, according to Ranta, that label could only be given following an investigation by the Hague war crimes tribunal or by Yugoslavian authorities.
The Racak killings later became the basis for one of the war crimes charges leveled against the late Serb leader Slobodan Milosovic.
Soon after Ranta handed in her report, NATO began bombing Yugoslavian towns in March 1999 to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists.
Belgrade and Western countries agreed in June that year on the withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo and a halt of NATO's air campaign and the province was placed under UN control.
In February this year, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
In addition to the Kosovo probe, Ranta has also investigated the remains of victims in Iraq and Nepal, as well as tsunami victims in Thailand.

 The citizens of Kathmandu are in confusion and in a state of panic following an indefinite embargo on the capital, called by the Maoists. There has also been anger that people will not be able to leave or enter the capital due to the embargo. However, due to fears of retribution by the Maoists, few people are willing to express their opinion and anger publicly.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 18 Aug 04
There was confusion among passengers at exit points and bus terminals in the capital since early this morning as ticket counters were shut and there was no movement of long-distance buses. Only eight buses and six private cars risked the embargo and left the capital today. However, in the afternoon, some 25 vehicles which left the capital were escorted by the army up to 26 km away from the capital. Army sources say, security will be provided in a similar manner for vehicles leaving and entering the capital. However, passengers and bus operators have their doubts about their safety despite the army's assurances. On a routine day anything between 900 and 1,000 vehicles come and go through the Thankot point in the capital. The embargo has not only affected vehicle movement in and out of Kathmandu but has also brought transport to a halt in Nuwakot, Tanahu and Rasuwa and other surrounding areas adjoining the capital.
 Meanwhile, leaders of the ruling parties in government say the embargo on the capital could be a strategic move by the Maoists to pressure the government into peace talks. Talking to Kantipur Television today, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Bam Dev Gautam said the embargo was going to have a direct effect on the common people but, he said, the doors for peace talks would not be closed due to the Maoists embargo.  passage omitted: repetition of Guatam's remarks
 Likewise, the leader of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), Narayan Khadka, said, with the Maoist call for an indefinite embargo on the capital, the government must now be serious on holding peace talks.

The protesters, who remained peaceful as hundreds of riot police kept watch, are also demanding immediate parliamentary elections.
The protest was organized by the country's six largest political parties, including the Nepali Congress party and the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal. Similar protests in the past have ended in violent clashes between police and the demonstrators.
Nepal has been hit by political turbulence since King Gyanendra in October 2002 fired the former prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control the Maoist insurgency.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 for a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
Demonstrators have been calling for immediate parliamentary elections, claiming the current government - led by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a loyalist to the king - is unconstitutional.
The king has ignored the demands despite regular protests.

"4737",20061407,"Title: Nepal 's parliament set to strip king of most his powers_ reports.rtf; Date: May 15, 2006 Monday 3:25 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's House of Representatives is set to approve on Monday a resolution cutting most of the powers of King Gyanendra, local media reports said.
The resolution, to be tabled by Nepal's alliance of seven main political parties, would first declare the parliament as ""sovereign and all-powerful.""
The resolution would strip the king of his post of the supreme commander of the Royal Nepalese Army and vest the parliament with the king's exclusive powers of enacting laws relating to succession to the throne. The Constitution of 1990 vests these powers with the king.
The king's income and private property would be taxed, while questions could be raised in a court against any allegedly illegal action of the monarch.
The Royal Nepalese Army would be renamed as the ""Nepalese Army"" and the army chief would be appointed by the State Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on the recommendation of the prime minister.
The resolution, which will also be called a political declaration, undertakes to change the government's name from ""His Majesty's Government"" to the ""Nepalese Government,"" the reports said.
Ordinarily, these changes would require amending the Constitution, according to political observers.
King Gyanendra reinstated the parliament last month, fulfilling the key demand of Nepal's main political parties. It had been dissolved in May 2002.
The parties had launched a popular revolt against the king's direct rule, after he seized power in February 2005.
Top alliance leaders were meeting Monday morning to finalize the resolution to be tabled at the house later in the day, the reports said.
The parliament will also ask the Maoist rebels to join the new government though they are not represented in the house.
The rebels, however, have termed reinstatement of the dissolved parliament as meaningless and called for its early dissolution.

The insurgents has accused the firms of supporting the government and exploiting workers.
The guerrillas had bombed some for defying orders to close.
The rebels dropped threats of violence against the firms and said they could reopen in talks between executives, government officials and members of a union affiliated with the insurgents, said Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a human rights activist who negotiated the deal.
He said the government promised to release two members of the outlawed trade union and investigate the disappearance of other members who were last seen being picked up by soldiers.
The rebels are fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 1996. Violence escalated after peace talks broke down in August last year.

Police wielding batons charged thousands of protesters in three areas of the capital who were chanting slogans against the monarchy, witnesses said. The home ministry said five protesters and four policemen were injured.
A ministry statement said 41 demonstrators were detained across the city ""for obstructing the roads and chanting objectionable slogans.""
Protesters also threw stones and damaged two buses, a truck and two motorcycles that had defied the shutdown, the home ministry said.
Nepal's five major parties jointly called the strike to protest against such police crackdowns on their demonstrations.
It was the first strike called by the five-party alliance since it launched the protests against King Gyanendra over his dismissal of the elected government in October 2002.
However, the Kathmandu area, home to around 1.5 million people, has seen numerous strikes called by Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy and set up a communist republic.
The only vehicles seen on the streets Monday belonged to the government or to diplomats, whose cars were escorted by vans of armed police.
The opposition also exempted wedding processions, as February is a prime month for marriages in the world's only Hindu kingdom.
The alliance said the strike would also not affect the movement of tourists, diplomats, journalists, ambulances, wedding processions, milk distributors and waste disposal teams.
Amid the strike, ambassadors from European Union countries Monday met the royal-appointed prime minister, Surya Bahadur Thapa, and urged him to resolve the ""political and parliamentary crisis,"" a French embassy statement said.
The envoys also expressed concern about human rights violations during the crackdown on the Maoists.
The strike was called because the king ""has continued to enforce his regressive move and thwart the people's democratic rights by extensively using the police and army to suppress the public voice,"" said Lilamani Pokharel, leader of the People's Front Nepal, which backs the strike.
""We are compelled to continue our struggle against the king's regression and to restore democracy and the people's fundamental rights in the country,"" he told reporters Sunday.
But the king has been unmoved by the demonstrations, calling for the restoration of an elected government.
Gyanendra, in an interview with Time magazine released last week, said he supported multi-party democracy but offered no time-frame for new polls.
He defended his decision to dismiss the elected government for ""incompetence"".
""Had I not acted as I did, I think Nepal would be in a worse situation than it is today,"" the king said.
The government had urged the opposition to call off the strike.
""It is obvious that any bandh (strike) by any side could vandalise public and private property, which would badly affect public life as well as the national economy,"" the home ministry said in an appeal ahead of the strike.

 Kolti, Bajura District, far western Nepal , 11 October: After Maoist rebels destroyed the control tower and office buildings of the Civil Aviation Authority here in Kolti on 8 March 2002, the control room has been shifted to a tiny rented room of a local house, causing peril for flights coming in and going out of Kolti airstrip.
 The control room staff has to communicate manually with pilots and the control tower by popping out from a window, from where the view of the runway is not clear at all. There are no instruments to gauge and forecast the weather, nor any safety equipment in case of any untoward incident or emergency.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 12 Oct 04
""We have to inform pilots about weather conditions after looking at the sky, and information on air pressure is provided after checking how much the leaves on a nearby tree shake,"" said an official, revealing the inherent danger of plane travel here.
 With the announcement of the state of emergency in the country, the security forces guarding the airfield were relocated to the district headquarters Martadi. Maoist rebels, who were looking for just such an opportunity to cut off the area from the rest of the country, damaged all the buildings by bombing them.
 Locals heaved a sigh of relief when security force personnel were redeployed for the security of the airfield on 27 April 2003 and flights to Kolti airstrip, though few and far in between, resumed.
 ""Although a few private airlines and chartered flights have risked landing planes here, a hundred per cent safety factor cannot be assured in the lack of required equipment and office building,"" according to one of the office staff.
 ""We have had narrow escapes a couple of times as information we provided was not accurate and quite different from what was actually happening on the runway, which in any case was most often misunderstood by the pilots, "" said Bal Kumar Singh, chief of the control tower office here in Kolti.  passage omitted
 ""The government's apathy towards the gravity of the case has resulted in a worrisome flight for passengers flying in here,"" a local accused.
 Further, to add to the locals' woes they have had to pay very high fares to private airlines companies, as a result of the inconsistent and irregular flight schedules of the state-run Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation.

 Tokyo, 10 September: The Japanese government announced the appointment of nine ambassadors Friday 10 September , including Yoshiji Nogami, who was sacked as vice foreign minister in 2002 due to a dispute with the foreign minister, as Japan's envoy to Britain.
 The government also promoted Toshiro Suzuki, 50, a minister at the Japanese embassy in Iraq since July, to ambassador, making him the first Japanese ambassador to Baghdad in 13 years since the Persian Gulf War.
 Ministry officials said naming an ambassador to Iraq will help demonstrate Tokyo's resolve to help build a democratic Iraq. Japan's last ambassador to Iraq, Kunio Katakura, made extensive efforts to protect Japanese nationals in Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis. He left Iraq shortly before the US-led coalition forces attacked the country in January 1991. He was relieved of his post in September that year.
Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English 0420 gmt 10 Sep 04
Nogami, 62, who will replace Masaki Orita, was fired as vice foreign minister by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in February 2002 due to a dispute with then Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka. Some lawmakers of both the governing and opposition parties criticized Nogami's ""revival"", saying it was inappropriate for Koizumi to reappoint Nogami to a high-profile post without clear explanations.
 Koizumi defended his decision, telling reporters Friday, ""I appointed an appropriate person to an appropriate post.""
 Kyoji Komachi, 58, secretary-general of the Cabinet Office's International Peace Cooperation Headquarters, was named ambassador to the Netherlands. Ambassador to Kuwait Sumio Tarui, 57, will replace Komachi.

"1312",20031913,"Title: South Asian Poor Fare Worst in Cold Snap.rtf; Date: January 20, 2003 Monday; Text: It's for people like Shashi Bala that the cold sweeping South Asian bites the fiercest. In her crowded New Delhi shantytown, where unemployment and disease are rampant and poverty the norm, she stays warm amid near-freezing temperatures because she has no choice.
She has no heater and no hot water. She has to walk to find a toilet or running water. She supports her disabled husband and 2-year-old daughter with the tiny income she gets renting out a small storefront.
""If I started feeling the cold then how would I go on?"" she demanded.
As a monthlong cold wave hammers parts of India, Bangladesh and Nepal, it is the poor who fare the worst in the daily fight against dropping temperatures.
On some days, dozens of them lose that fight. By Monday, more than 1,600 people, many of them poor or homeless, had died of the cold across South Asia.
The regional temperatures would be cozy for January if this was North Dakota or Helsinki, Finland. But in South Asia, where winters are normally short and mild, millions live in shacks or mud-and-thatch houses without heat or electricity. Millions more have no homes and sleep outdoors. In Delhi, where the average January temperature is 58 degrees, the Sunday temperature dropped as low as 39 degrees.
The longest New Delhi cold wave in decades has been compounded by power outages that left many neighborhoods with two-to-three hour electricity outages Sunday, and a thick nightly fog that can reduce visibility to under 100 feet. The fog has repeatedly shut down New Delhi's airports, and caused extensive train delays - some lasting well over a day.
In wealthier neighborhoods, the rush for electrical heaters has left some appliance stores sold out.
That's not the kind of problem they face in Yamuna Pushta, a maze-like shantytown that attracts the poorest newcomers to India's capital.
Here, along the polluted banks of the Yamuna River, Bangladeshi immigrants and Indians who have come from rural areas hoping for better lives struggle to keep their families going. Few have electricity, let alone electrical heaters. Doctors here have seen a spike in bronchial infections and pneumonia.
Bala says she doesn't feel the cold and that even her daughter, Zeva, doesn't let it get to her, playing barefoot in streets covered with garbage and filth.
""I don't know why,"" she said. Then she answers the question herself, saying she has no choice but to endure.
But plenty of others do feel the cold. A woman named Pratima - she uses only one name, and just smiles when asked her age - feels it badly. She covers herself with a shawl and crouches over a cooking fire to try to keep warm. She doesn't have the money to buy firewood for heat. But she still finds a way to feed rice and meat stew to her dog, a squat, friendly mongrel called Pitu that she lavishes with love.
And nearby, a mechanic for the thousands of bicycle-rickshaw drivers who live here feels it, too. Suraj - he also uses only one name - walks into a small wood-and-plastic-sheeting tea stall with his hands covered in grease, his head wrapped in a light brown scarf.
""Since the first of January, the cold is very bad,"" he said, holding his hands out so visitors can feel how frigid they are. He spends up to one-third of his salary, which ranges from 80 cents to $1.60 a day, on firewood. But that only keeps his family warm from sundown until about 11 p.m. Hopefully, he says, they're all asleep by midnight and don't feel the worst of the weather.
He wishes that this year was an election year. Then the politicians would hand blankets and food.
""But there are no elections close by, so no one is bringing us blankets,"" he said.
Forecasters say things could be looking up for the residents of Yamuna Pushta. The cold spell in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is expected to continue into next week, although northwestern India, including New Delhi, is likely to get warmer.
So for millions of poor South Asians, the pain of the cold will continue.
In Patna, the capital of Bihar, the temperature on Sunday dropped to 40.
""When blankets are distributed, the men push ahead and grab them all. We get nothing,"" said Bindu Devi, who lives on the street in Patna with her four children.
""I haven't seen any wood either. I'm burning anything my children can find on the streets,"" she said as she held out her hands to a heap of smoking embers. Around her, the air was heavy with the stench of burning tires.

""There are important decisions to be made during high-level talks with the seven-party government,"" a statement from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) said.
""The central committee meeting of our party has decided that chairman Prachanda will lead the team,"" the statement said.
The date, location and format of the talks have yet to be announced and the government has not yet named a negotiation delegation.
Prachanda will not be there for the preliminary discussions, but will head the delegation for ""high level"" talks with the government, the statement from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) said.
The rebel leader and former school teacher, whose name means ""the fierce one,"" rarely makes public appearances.
The Maoist statement contained a 10 point roadmap outlining the conditions for talks.
The release of all rebel prisoners was a precondition before negotiations could begin, the Maoist statement said.
Under the 10 point roadmap, the rebels have called for the dissolution of parliament, the constitution and the government once talks have begun.
They demand that once talks have begun an interim government should be formed and an interim constitution should be written, according to the statement signed by Prachanda.
Nepal's rebels announced a ceasefire which was matched by the new government late last month.
The multi party government was thrust back into power after King Gyanendra caved in and ended 14 months of direct rule after weeks of mass street protests left at least 19 dead.
The parties and rebels made a loose alliance last November, further isolating King Gyanendra, the world's solo Hindu monarch.

It was unclear, though, what the penalty against King Gyanendra might be. Nepal has no laws concerning how to punish crimes by a king and the case is the first involving a monarch in a country where kings are revered as near-deities.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said those found guilty in the commission's report would be punished.
The April crackdown left at least 19 people dead and hundreds injured and eventually forced the king to cede power and reinstate parliament after 14-months of direct rule by the monarch.
Parliament then quickly stripped Gyanendra of his powers, his command over the army and his immunity from prosecution.
The commission questioned top government and security officials. It also sent written questions to the Gyanendra, but the king did not respond, giving no reason.
Commission member Harihar Birahi said the investigation focused on official misuse of power, state funds and human rights abuses during the king's authoritarian rule.
Besides Gyanendra, the commission also found another 201 officials in the king's administration responsible for the bloody crackdown.
They included the chiefs of the police and the armed forces. The chiefs of the civil and armed police have been suspended while the army chief has retired.
Hundreds of pro-democracy activists were also detained during the April crackdown, and some said they were tortured.

"6962",20083219,"Title: DPS STUDENT STABBED TO DEATH IN NOIDA FLAT.rtf; Date: May 17, 2008 Saturday 5:50 PM  EST; Text: Noida, May 17 -- Hours after she animatedly discussed her birthday party plans with a classmate, a 14-year-old girl was stabbed to death by the family's domestic help at her Sector 25 residence in Noida.
A class IX student of DPS, Noida, and the only child of a practising dental surgeon couple, Aarushi Talwar was reportedly stabbed to death in her sleep. The parents were asleep in the adjoining room of their flat. While the police are tightlipped about the motive of the crime, there is speculation that the Nepali servant first tried to assault her sexually. The accused, 45-year-old Hem Prasad, had been employed by the Talwars eight months ago on the recommendation of their old help. Prasad was hired without police verification.
Aarushi's father Rajesh Talwar is a dentist in Fortis Hospital and her mother runs her own dental clinic in Noida's posh Sector 18.
According to sources, Rajesh went to open the main door for the maid on Friday morning after Prasad didn't respond to her knocking. When he looked around the house for Prasad, he was shocked to find Aarushi lying in a pool of blood on her bed. The girl had received four stab wounds -- two on the forehead and one each on her chest and waist.
The Talwar family has been living in the flat for the past 10 years. As news of the incident spread, residents of the posh colony went into a state of shock. Four relatives of the accused have been detained and raids are being conducted on Prasad's suspected hideouts in Noida, Delhi and other NCR areas.
""He consumed alcohol in the drawing room. Then he opened Aarushi's room and stabbed her while she was in deep sleep,"" said Akhilesh Kumar, ASP Noida. Two empty bottles of liquor have been recovered from the drawing room of the flat. Police have seized the bottles and glasses and lifted some fingerprints from there. Robbery has been ruled out as motive behind the murder since the room was in order and there were no signs of struggle.
""We are still looking for the real motive behind the heinous crime,"" added Kumar. The incident happened late at night as Aarushi had spoken to her friend on telephone around 10 pm. It was her birthday on May 14 and she was planning a party for her classmates the coming Sunday.
The school was to close for summer vacations on Friday, so Aarushi was in a hurry to finalise the party plan and inform her friends about it. ""She was an excellent girl and wanted to be a doctor. She always secured a high percentage in all examinations. She was quite decent and cooperative,"" said Aasna, one of her classmates. When the news reached her school, teary-eyed students in their school uniform made a beeline for Sector 25.
Aarushi's body was handed over to the parents after the post-mortem examination and ""excess loss of blood due to stabbing"" was cited as the cause of death. The viscera has been preserved for biopsy. Police have announced a reward for any information about the absconding accused.
The Talwars had hired Hem Prasad eight moths ago on the recommendation of their domestic help of eight years, Vishnu Sharma, who also hails from Nepal. ""They didn't get any police verification done, so we do not have any information about Prasad's criminal background,"" ASP Akhilesh Kumar said.
Noida's Sector 21 and 25 are considered well-managed and safe as the RWA is in the hands of retired Air Force-Naval officers. ""The verification of servants here is compulsory but sometimes the residents do not heed cautions. We issue passes for domestic helps that have to be renewed every three months,"" said Vice-Admiral (Ret) Inderjit Bedi PVSM, AVSM, who is the chairman of Sector 21/25 RWA. There are 1,820 flats in this sector and almost all have domestic helps but the Talwars are among a handful who did not care to get their domestic help verified by the police.
Earlier this month, a housemaid had looted the residence of a leading architect, Sandeep Bali, after serving drugged food to the entire family on the first day of her job at Sector 15A. She had also been appointed without verification and the police have still not been able to trace the absconding woman.

 Kathmandu: As the internal conflict has escalated in the country, all three wings of security forces - the Royal Nepalese Army, Armed Police Force and Nepal Police, have been modernizing as well as recruiting new manpower. Despite acknowledgement by the prime minister and other responsible officials that a growing defence budget was chipping away at investment in development and social services, the change in the shape and size of the security forces has continued unabated.
 Just over a month ago, the Royal Nepalese Army inducted 200 women soldiers and now it has opened up vacancies for women officers in non-technical posts. Although no exact number has been revealed, sources said around one hundred female officers will be recruited and several new positions will be opened up. Nepal Police, meanwhile, has started accepting applications for 600 new vacancies since Wednesday 22 September . In April, the government had passed a proposal by the Nepal police to open vacancies for 800 posts, including two assistant inspectors-general of police.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Sep 04, p 1
Similarly, by recruiting 1,600 new members last year, the Armed Police Force is planning to increase its strength to 25,000 soon. A source said following the government approval of a proposal to form two new division headquarters and seven brigades, the Armed Police force is currently carrying out studies to recruit more manpower. The security forces have adopted a strategy to increase their strength by phases, as the Finance Ministry declined to provide required money in one instalment.
 The Royal Nepalese Army, since its deployment two years ago, had added nearly 28,000 soldiers to its strength. In late 2000, the strength of the Royal Nepalese Army stood at around 50,000.
 During the same period, Nepal Police has added 7,000 personnel. Armed Police Force, too, added another 7,000 personnel to its strength during the same period.
 In the fiscal year 1997/98 the defence budget was 5bn rupees. In 2000/2001 the defence budget rose to 13bn rupees.

  The elections have been widely dismissed by critics as a sham.
  While Roop Singh Thapa took the oath of office as the Mayor of Butwal Municipal Corporation, Ram Prasad Shauniar took the oath as Mayor of the Siddharthnagar Municipal block.
  The elections were boycotted by most political parties amid widespread protests and demonstrations.
  Speaking after the oath taking, Thapa said his objective was the sole agenda after taking office would be the development of the region. In a veiled reference to the numerous protests against the elections, Thapa said violence would get the country nowhere.
  ""Discipline is a prerequisite to progress. My main agenda is to take all people together in the efforts towards development. I will work with full committment towards the progress of our region,"" he said.
  On Wednesday, a Nepali activist was killed by the army during one of the protests.
  The elections also saw a low turnout - at 20 percent, and less than third of the last elections - were a resounding vote against King Gyanendra's rule after he took absolute power and sacked the government last February.
  Analysts say the poll has further weakened the unpopular king's position and may be the beginning of the end of his rule and even the monarchy itself.
  The government says the low turnout was caused by a boycott by the seven main political parties and the threat of violence by Maoist rebels fighting to end the world's only Hindu monarchy.
  But violence on the day was scattered.
  While seizing power, King Gyanendra arrested politicians and suspended civil liberties.
  He justified the move by saying he was forced to do so because the government he appointed could not end the Maoist rebellion.
  But there has been no progress towards peace and the bloodshed has continued unabated.
  Countries that prop up the impoverished Himalayan nation with aid are worried the political crisis and the Maoist revolt could lead to total chaos and make it a haven for militant groups.
  They have appealed for the king to talk to the parties and restore democracy.
  More than 13,000 people have been killed in the Maoist revolt since 1996.

New Delhi, 22 February: The government of Nepal has asked India to resume its supply of weapons to Nepal. Nepalese envoy to India Karna Dhoj Adhikari said Nepal has asked India to resume arms supply. 
Talking to The Himalayan Times today, Adhikari said: ""We have asked India several times to resume supply of arms that were promised earlier."" 
Even though India had stopped the supply of all lethal weapons to Nepal after the royal takeover last year, some non-lethal weapons were still provided at one time. 
Talks between the governments of Nepal and India focus on weapons supply, Adhikari said, adding: ""The Indian side has said they stand for the restoration of democracy and peace through dialogue and reconciliation."" 
Meanwhile, Indian External State Minister E Ahmed, submitting a written statement to the Indian parliament today, said Nepal was continuing with its request to resume weapons supply. 
""We have received the Nepalese government's request to resume military assistance. But the Indian government's stand remains unchanged,"" he said, adding some non-lethal weapons were provided to Nepal after some leaders and human rights activists were released from detention after the lifting of the state of emergency in Nepal. As a close friend of Nepal, India wishes to see the restoration of peace, stability and development in Nepal soon, he told parliament. He also said India was aware of Nepal receiving some lethal and non-lethal weapons from countries like China and Pakistan. 
However, Adhikari said India was the first priority when it comes to weapons or other military assistance or training for Nepal.

Hillary said he didn't feel any great appreciation for Norgay saving his life, as the New Zealand adventurer hurtled down a crevasse on a block of ice.
When Norgay tightened the rope that bound them, enabling Hillary to climb out of the sheer-walled ice chasm, Hillary said: ""Tenzing and I were a team. I expected Tenzing to carry out the right procedures in an emergency, just as I would.""
""Teamwork got Tenzing and me to the top of Everest,"" Hillary told an audience of mountaineers and school children, as the government handed out awards to Indian sportsmen in honor of Norgay, who was born in Nepal but was a resident of India for much of his life.
Hillary did not mention his claim - made in his autobiography published after Norgay's death in 1986 - that it was he, not his Sherpa guide and teammate, who had been the first to step onto the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit.
That claim has caused bad blood with Norgay's family, because during Norgay's lifetime, neither man would say who reached the summit first, insisting that it was a team effort.
But the ill feeling was not evident Tuesday as Norgay's son Jamling shook hands with Hillary on stage and listened to the New Zealand-born adventurer's praise of his father.
""Tenzing was a strong and brave man, a man of whom your country can well be proud,"" said Hillary, a former New Zealand high commissioner to India who stopped in New Delhi to commemorate the Everest climb.
Larger ceremonies are planned next week in Nepal, on the anniversary of the May 29, 1953 achievement.
Hillary told a rapt audience about how he almost died shortly before the Everest climb as he and Norgay headed up the dangerous icefall from base camp ""just to prove how fit we were.""
On the way back down from 6,400 meters (21,000 feet), the two men were trying to reach camp before dark.
Hillary recalled, ""We were roped together and I pounded down in the lead, when we reached another of the innumerable crevasses, very deep … and too wide to step across.""
A chunk of ice was attached to the wall of the crevasse, providing an extension point to cross. ""Without too much sense, I leapt into the air and landed with both feet on the chunk of ice,"" said Hillary. ""The chunk of ice broke off and fell down into the crevasse with me on it.""
Describing what seemed like an elevator ride down a tube of ice, Hillary said that, as time passed, he ""came to the conclusion that if Tenzing didn't tighten the rope soon,"" he and the chunk of ice would hit the bottom of the chasm and ""smash into smithereens.""
Just then, Hillary said, ""the rope came tight, and I swung into the ice wall. Then it was just a routine matter of cutting steps in the wall and climbing up.""

Pokhara, [Friday] 7 September: Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula Friday said that the Nepali people have reached the final turn leading to victory in their battle against the monarchy.

""There should be unity and reconciliation among the parties to give a sense of Constituent Assembly to the people of all castes, creeds, professions, and communities,"" he said.
Stating that the CA polls have become a matter of concern and importance not only for the Nepalese people but also for the international community, the home minister stressed the need for free and fair CA elections.
""The international community is watching us if we would be able to hold free and fair elections, forgetting the bitterness and animosity of the conflict period and providing relief to the victims,"" he added.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 30 November; subheading as published
Nepalgunj [mid-west Nepal]: Ten schools have been returned to government care from the community ownership following repeated threats and lock-ups by the Maoist rebels.
This is the first time community schools have been returned to government management.
Management committee officials of these schools held repeated negotiations with the Maoists before they approached the district education officer, Durga Nath Sharma, and asked him to return the schools back to government ownership.
A meeting of the school steering committee, headmasters and the teachers decided to return the schools to the government management. The decision has been approved by the Nepal Teachers Association.
A total of 26 schools had been handed over to the communities in Banke District in the last three years. [Passage omitted: names of schools]
The Maoists have been putting pressure on the communities to return the schools back to government management saying that the communities will not be able to run the schools due to financial crunch if the government tries to stay away from bearing responsibilities.
District education officer Durga Nath Sharma said that the government had handed over only the management of the schools to the communities for local empowerment. The government will never shirk from its responsibilities, he said. Different incentives have been given to the community-managed schools. Those schools that have returned back to government management will not be able to enjoy those facilities, he said.
Matching fund
After the communities started returning the schools on one pretext or other, the government has increased facilities in order to attract the communities. The incentive has come in the name of ""matching fund"".
According the district education office, the government will contribute an equal amount when the communities deposit their own fund ranging from 5,000 to 1,000,000 rupees. [Passage omitted: communities show reluctance to manage schools]

 Kathmandu, 6 September: Home Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka has told the cabinet meeting that an investigation has been launched on the possibility of a break in coordination in the chain of command among the security forces while trying to control violence in Kathmandu on Wednesday 1 September .
 Following repeated questions over weak security arrangements by fellow ministers, the home minister admitted that the security might have been weak and said efforts were under way to find the reasons by questioning concerned authorities.
 ""Investigation is currently under way to find where the security arrangements failed,"" a cabinet source told Kantipur, quoting the home minister. He further said that after the report is prepared into the failure of security agencies, action would be taken against concerned security officials.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Sep 04 p1
Despite the government being aware about the possibilities of the protests, it had not anticipated the level of violence at so many places at the same time, the meeting reviewing the situation concluded.
 The source said the home minister had ordered security forces not to interfere in spontaneous protest demonstrations. But the minister issued another orders to intervene following rioting and outbreak of violence to bring the situation under control. ""But for some unknown reason, the order was not implemented,"" the source said quoting the home minister.
 The authorities completely failed to control the rioting that erupted on Wednesday during demonstrations against the murders of 12 innocent Nepali hostages by Iraqi terrorists on Tuesday. Despite repeated calls for security for more than two hours, the police were unable to do anything.
 The home minister told the cabinet meeting that he was seeking clarification with security chiefs on the failure to control vandalism and violence. ""Who stopped the police from providing security and why could the police not provide security? The home minister will seek answers to these questions and take necessary actions,"" the source said.
 The meeting seriously reviewed Wednesday's violence and the prime minister's visit to India. He further said the security situation in Kathmandu was now under control.
 Government spokesman and Minister for Information and Communication Mohammad Mohsin said the cabinet takes full responsibility for the violence and added that those involved would be identified and the government was committed to take action against them.
 ""Resignations of ministers, resignation of senior police officials are not the answer - discussions were held on ways to prevent such incidents from repeating in the future.""

 New Delhi, 21 November: The Indian defence establishment is scrambling to supply a third Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) to Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) after one of the two ALHs it recently delivered to its northern neighbour crashed in western Nepal about three weeks ago.
 One senior RNA officer was hurt when the ALH crashed at an undisclosed location in Lumbini zone on 28 October, according to a highly placed military source in New Delhi. The light helicopter was on a reconnaissance mission when it went down.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 22 Nov 04
News of that crash was not kept under wraps as New Delhi agreed to replace that chopper with a new one immediately. ""The chopper could be sent shortly before, or after the visit of RNA chief Gen Pyar Jung Thapa (who is scheduled to visit India in the last week of November),"" an officer said.
 India had delivered the two ALHs to Nepal on 12 June.
 Prior to the ALH, India had supplied Cheetah and Lancer helicopters to RNA. India has been providing military equipment and hardware to RNA at ""70:30 ratio"", meaning that Nepal is required to pay only 30 per cent of the cost price.
 RNA, whose strength is crossing 80,000 from just 45,000 four years ago, is said to be short of essential military equipment and weaponry to arm its rapidly growing forces that are taking on Maoist rebels.
 And, this is true of its ground troops, Special Forces - modelled after US Army's Ranger Battalion - and the air wing, popularly called the 11th Brigade.
 Aside from the Indian-made choppers, RNA boasts of aircraft like Mi-17, M28 Skytruck, Avro and Puma. Just recently, the UK - which provided two ""archaic"" MI-17 choppers - announced its plans to provide more ""non-lethal"" military assistance such as two Islander aircraft.

Excerpt from news report by Ramesh Pandey published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 13 November
More than 200 members of the general public from five dozen families have been displaced from Biruwaguthi and Manawa Village Development Committees in Parsa [district adjacent to Bara] in the past one month because of insecurity. Most of those displaced are educated youths from middle class families.
As it was not possible to pursue their occupations in the villages because of insecurity, people who have been living there for years have left their houses and lands behind and gone to more secure places.
With the displacement there is very little activity now in these once densely populated villages. Most of those displaced have sought refuge at Simara, Hetauda and Bharatpur [towns in south central Nepal] where they are now staying with relatives. They have been forced to move out of their villages after underground groups in the Terai [southern plains] started perpetrating murders, demanding donations and issuing threats.
The displacement from the villages started after the murder of teacher Loknath Gaire of Nepal Rastriya Higher Secondary School. The 28-year-old was shot dead by workers of the Republican Terai Liberation Front-Jwala Singh group. Gaire was killed for not paying the amount of donation demanded of him.
Workers of the front have been coming to the villages in the night, demanding donations from select houses and putting up threatening posters, local resident Sadananda Dev Pandey said. [Passage omitted: further details] ""But for the inability to sell off their lands, more people would have left the villages"", Pandey said. With the displacement, farming activity in the villages has also declined. [Passage omitted: further details about falling land values and the condition of Gaire's family]

"6223",20071974,"Title: Nepalese looking for dozens missing after bridge over icy river collapses; 15 confirmed dead.rtf; Date: December 26, 2007 Wednesday 1:30 PM GMT; Text: Hundreds of police, soldiers and villagers searched an icy river in western Nepal on Wednesday for more than 50 people believed missing after a steel footbridge collapsed. At least 15 people were confirmed dead and dozens more were injured, officials said.
The estimate of the missing was sharply reduced from the more than 100 whose whereabouts were unknown following the collapse.
""We now think that only about 50 people could be missing,"" chief government administrator Anil Pandey told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
""The reason for the higher estimate on Tuesday was the confusion and chaos that followed the accident,"" he said. ""People saw scores of people fall in the river but many of them survived by hanging on to the cables or by managing to swim to the shore. Many people who their relatives thought were missing have also returned to the villages today.""
But hopes of finding more survivors in the treacherous mountain river with a strong current were slim, Pandey said.
""We have policemen and soldiers on both sides of the river searching,"" he said.
Some 500 people traveling to a village fair on Tuesday were crossing the Bheri River on the bridge when its support cables snapped under the weight, he said. The 400-foot-long bridge in Chunchu village was built this year, Pandey said, but it was not designed to hold the weight of so many people crossing at once.
Rescuers had recovered 15 bodies, and 32 people who were seriously injured were flown to hospitals. Crowds that gathered after the collapse tried to save the victims and treated dozens of wounded with light injuries at the scene.
Five of the critically injured were sent to Katmandu for treatment at a military hospital. Most appeared to have head injuries and broken bones.
""Most people did not know what happened,"" said Durga Bika, 20, from his hospital bed in Katmandu. ""The bridge collapsed and most people on the crowded bridge fell in the river. The bridge was on top of me and my leg was caught. My friends pulled me out and saved me.""
Bika said he saw some people swim to safety while others were rescued by villagers. He could not say how many people were missing but concurred with the estimate by authorities of about 400-500 people who were on the bridge when it collapsed.
Police chief Naresh Shakya, who was coordinating the rescue, said villagers had begun to report missing relatives to officials who were traveling around the area to collect names.
The rescue team's efforts were being hampered by the area's difficult terrain, said Yam Prasad Subedi, a government official.
Chunchu is about 310 miles west of Katmandu in a rural part of this Himalayan country with few paved roads. The most common way of traveling is by foot or oxcart.
Much of the impoverished region's already-poor infrastructure was devastated by the decade-long communist uprising that ended last year. The Maoist rebels, who controlled much of the area, would frequently blow up bridges and roads to impede government troop movements.
The fair attracts thousands of people from surrounding villages. It is held every month after the full moon.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 15 January
Bhaktapur: The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has prepared a strategy to raise its revolutionary agenda forcefully in the interim legislature and wound up a meeting of its lawmakers who will represent the party in that interim legislature.
Meeting at Bhaktapur Guest House on Sunday [14 January], 73 lawmakers who will represent the Maoist party in the interim legislature discussed at length ways to project the party as a political front rather than as a wartime formation.
However, 10 lawmakers who were nominated to the interim legislature by the Maoists from among independent individuals were not present at the meeting. 
The meeting also formed a nine-member management committee for the interim legislature. The committee comprises Maoist party spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Dev Gurung, Dinanath Sharma, Lokendra Bista, Janardan Sharma, Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, Matrika Yadav, Hisila Yami and Lekhraj Bhatta.
Maoist spokesperson Mahara said the Maoist lawmakers would stake a claim for the post of speaker and create an environment to choose the Speaker through election.
At the meeting, Maoist chairman Prachanda and Dr Baburam Bhattarai gave training to Maoist lawmakers on the code of conduct in parliament and how one should argue and counter-argue there.
The Maoist lawmakers who do not have places to stay in Kathmandu are staying at Bhaktapur Guest House. [passage omitted]

 The interview given by the king to the Time magazine American weekly has given rise to a new wave in Nepalese politics. The King's interview showed that a constitutional monarch wants to be an active monarch and is challenging the constitution of 1990 the new constitution after the success of the people's movement for democracy in 1990 .
 Through its comments, attempts to place the blame on the political parties had been made. If the political parties have indulged in criminal activities, then only the people who are invested with sovereign rights have the right to take action against them and the time to make this very clear has arrived.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 5 Feb 04
The nation's situation is not as it should be and is deteriorating. The government is not present in the villages. The Maoists are becoming more violent. The government is sitting in a limited area surrounded by barbed wire. Only that political party that represents the people can resolve such a situation. Those comments have even affected the international world negatively .
 For the King to say that for the speedy resolution of the problem should come together is just a hoax. In the presence of the King, I supported Madhav Nepal secretary general of the CPN-UML and Girija Prasad Koirala the president of the Nepali Congress party also immediately gave his support. But, why is it that until now nothing is being started?
 The king is surrounded by a limited circle of regressive elements. And which, just like in the erstwhile Panchayat regime the non-party system that was replaced by multiparty system after 1990 , has an aim to earn huge amount of wealthy through corrupt practices. A constitutional monarch must not listen to what the regressive elements are saying and should not allow them to circle him. This will lead to the king's loss. That is why the king must understand this immediately. It is in the king's hands to not allow such a situation to move forward.

    KATHMANDU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Nepali consul general in  Lhasa Tamla Ukyab said he has witnessed the development of Tibet  and felt that people there are now enjoying the benefits of rapid  economic growth. 
    Ukyab, who served as the consul general of Nepal in Lhasa from  1982 to 1988, told Xinhua in a recent interview that economic  development in Tibet was gaining momentum in the period when he  was there. 
    Ukyab said he personally witnessed the profound changes that  have taken place in Tibet, which has risen from an underdeveloped  area to a region that enjoys fast economic growth and social  stability. 
    The former diplomat recalled his first trip to Lhasa in the  late 1970s, saying that great changes have taken place in Tibet  over recent years. Now, he said, the roads are much better and it  takes only an hour to travel from the airport to the city proper  in Lhasa, much shorter than the time needed before. 
    Ukyab believed the Lhasa riots on March 14 were staged by a  handful of people and went against the will of most Tibetan  people. 
    This tragedy was a premeditated plot by those with ulterior  motives and those civilians who died in the riots fell victim to  the political conspiracy, he said. 
    The purpose of the Lhasa riots was to sabotage the upcoming  Beijing Olympic Games, and some Western media were bent on causing  confusion and chaos with their biased coverage of the riots, Ukyab  said. 
    Tibet is part of Chinese territory and it is a fact no one can  deny, Ukyab said, adding he believed the Chinese government is  capable of properly dealing with the issue. 
    ""The Olympic Games in Beijing this summer will not be  affected,"" he said.

""All the students and teachers have been successfully rescued by the army,"" the security official, who requested anonymity, told AFP.
""There were no clashes with the rebels in the rescue operation.""
The students were rescued three kilometres south of Chaimale village located on the Kathmandu outskirts from where they were seized Sunday, he said.
Security forces had launched an intense search for the secondary students and teachers who were abducted from two schools in Chaimale just four kilometres (2.5 miles) from an army barracks.
The kidnappings by the Maoists, who have been waging a deadly ""People's War"" to overthrow the monarchy since 1996, were the first ever in the Kathmandu valley, authorities said.
Until last weekend, the rebels had kidnapped students only from the countryside and usually released them after trying to indoctrinate them.
The Maoists control vast swathes of the countryside, often operating their own administrations.
The latest kidnappings followed a wave of Maoist attacks in and around the capital that have been seen by analysts as a show of strength by the rebels who want to install a communist republic in the landlocked kingdom.
The rescue followed an announcement the previous day by Nepal's new coalition government that it wanted to hold peace talks with the rebels.
Government officials were in contact with rebel leaders in a bid to smooth the way for peace talks, sources said Monday, amid reports Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara was in Kathmandu.

Thapa told reporters that a third round of peace talks, initially scheduled for May, would take place next week, but an exact date and venue was not yet decided.
The talks were delayed after the government refused to withdraw the army from rebel-held areas, saying it could not accept conditions that would undermine Nepal's sovereignty.
The army has been fighting the insurgents since November 2001 after emergency rule was imposed.
The rebels last week agreed to continue peace talks after the government said it would release three jailed rebel leaders and hand over a list with the status of 36 rebels reported missing.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a socialist state. More than 7,000 people have been killed during the insurgency.
The rebels declared a cease-fire in January and agreed to peace talks after the government stopped calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
Some violence, continues, however.
Meanwhile, the home ministry said three soldiers were killed and 20 others injured on Tuesday when their truck hit a landmine.
Police suspect the rebels had planted the landmine near the village of Ganeshchaur, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Katmandu.

  Although Koirala lauded India's moral support for his efforts in restoring democracy, he said countries supplying arms to King should be cautious to see how the arms are being put to use.
   ""We are thankful to India for the moral support extended to us in our efforts towards restoring democracy. We are also appreciative and thankful to the international community for having provided us with moral support,"" said Koirala.
  Though Koirala, who is currently heading a several-parties alliance against King Gyanendra , is visiting New Delhi primarily for a medical check up, he is likely to meet with various political leaders.
   Koirala said the world community should ensure that any arms supply to the King's government should not be diverted to suppress public opinion. 
  ""Whosoever is supplying arms, be it India, Britain or America, should realise that what is being done with these arms. One should realise whether these arms are being used against the Maoists, or are they being used to aid the dictatorship, or else it is being used to suppress the public."" said the former Prime Minsiter.
  Nepal had requested India to resume supply of arms and ammunition to its army after the emergency was lifted in the Himalyan kingdom.
  The King's decision to take power plunged Nepal into political turmoil as he jailed politicians and suspended civil liberties, saying he was acting to control the raging anti-monarchy Maoist insurgency which has killed 12,000 people since 1996. 
  Strict media censorship was imposed in the aftermath of the takeover, some of which has since been relaxed. In the latest crackdown, a private radio station in Kathmandu said it had been ordered to close.

"6593",20083597,"Title: Nepal celebrates peaceful vote as results trickle in.rtf; Date: April 11, 2008 Friday 1:58 PM GMT; Text: Results trickled in Friday as Nepal celebrated unexpectedly peaceful elections contested by Maoists and mainstream parties which are set to turn the Himalayan kingdom into a republic.
The vote on Thursday was a key plank of a peace deal with the Maoists to elect an assembly that will rewrite the constitution and is likely to abolish its 240-year-old besieged Hindu monarchy.
Despite fears polling would ignite violence, only sporadic incidents took place in a country recovering from a decade of civil war that left 13,000 dead.
United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon congratulated Nepal on the vote, which he said ""took place in a generally orderly and peaceful atmosphere.""
""Nepal stuns world, itself,"" read a banner headline in the English-language daily The Kathmandu Post.
""The Nepali people have once more proved doomsayers wrong,"" said the Nepali Times.
Still, at least 60 of the 21,000 polling stations will need to vote again, the Election Commission said late Friday.
""The number of re-polling stations will increase as we are still investigating the complaints received from our local election officers,"" commission spokesman Laxman Bhattarai told reporters.
Some villages reported their ballot boxes had been seized Friday en route to local headquarters for counting.
""Around 19 ballot boxes of several villages were torched and destroyed by the Maoists and Nepali Congress supporters,"" district official Drona Pokhrel told AFP from Dhading district, 30 kilometres (19 miles) west of Kathmandu.
But in spite of clashes, shootings and bombings in the weeks leading up to the polls, just 33 polling stations were forced to shut on voting day, the Election Commission said.
""This represents an historic achievement and is a tribute to the courage of the Nepali people and the conduct of the Election Commission,"" a US embassy statement said.
""In the days and weeks to come as the votes are counted, we urge patience and respect for the results.""
Security had been tight and only isolated flare-ups, including three deaths in the ethnically tense south, were reported -- no worse than some other days.
If the count goes smoothly, the results for more than a third of the seats allocated under the constituency system were expected in a week, the Election Commission said.
The rest of the seats, allocated by proportional representation, will take longer. Complete results were due to take several weeks.
""Counting is very sensitive. We have to be very careful so there is no mistake,"" the election commission spokesman said.
The only one of Kathmandu's 10 constituencies to use electronic voting machines was also the first to declare. The winner was the candidate of the centrist Nepali Congress led by octogenarian Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
Maoist party chief Prachanda was leading in his constituency on Kathmandu's southern edge, local television reports said.
In what might become a symbolic victory in another part of the city, the Maoist candidate was also ahead of the leader of the rival Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
Some 60 percent of Nepal's 17.6 million voters turned out to elect the new 601-seat assembly that is slated to write a new constitution.
But strains could start to show after the count. The first challenge would be to get the major parties to accept the results, analysts say.
The Maoists, whose 2006 peace deal ended the bloody civil war and the king's attempt to seize absolute power, received 84 seats in the 330-seat caretaker assembly and five ministries in the aftermath of the peace deal, without ever fighting an election.
""The very first challenge will be to get to the end of the counting process and have the major parties accept the results,"" said Rhoderick Chalmers, Nepal's country director for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group.
King Gyanendra, who ascended the throne in 2001 after the much-loved former monarch and most of his family were massacred by a drunk-and-drugged crown prince, will also be closely watched.
While widely unpopular for trying to seize total power, he can still count on support from sections of the army and from fundamentalists who see him as an incarnation of a Hindu god.

Thai Commerce Minister Watana Muangsook announced at the opening of the BIMSTEC ministerial talks on this Thai resort island that the deal was to be inked on Sunday after agreement was reached among member nations.
BIMSTEC's more developed members, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, were expected to pledge to cut tariffs to zero by 2012 while the two less-developed members, Bangladesh and Myanmar, were to be given an additional five years.
However, sources said the discussions hit a roadblock when the Bangladesh delegation, led by a civil servant after Trade Minister Manjur Morshed Khan fell ill, insisted they be compensated for any losses incurred.
""Bangladesh is not in a position to sign,"" Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow confirmed.
""Bangladesh did not want to be an obstacle to the signing of the agreement so they said -- you go ahead and sign and we can join later,"" he told reporters.
With only four of the seven-nation bloc now able to join the deal, BIMSTEC foreign ministers meeting here Sunday will discuss whether they should now aim instead for all seven members to sign at a summit planned for July, he said.
Incoming members Nepal and Bhutan were not part of the trade negotiations and had already been invited to join at a later date.
Sources at the talks said delegates were ""flummoxed"" by Bangladesh's proposal which they said did not outline in detail how they would be compensated.
They said that other member nations, particularly Sri Lanka which has already agreed on a free trade deal with India, tried unsuccessfully to convince them that their concerns could be addressed within the agreement.
In upbeat opening comments before the controversy blew up, Watana said the deal would unleash the ""enormous potential and resources"" of the region of 1.3 billion people, which had so far gone largely untapped.
""I am convinced that our success in establishing the free trade area will greatly increase both our inter-regional and intra-regional trade,"" he said.
Watana also took a swipe at Western nations, saying that while they promoted free trade they raised protectionist tariffs that diminished purchasing power for their own products, and that Asian nations should not follow their example.
""Has uncontrolled self-interest blinded all rational decisions? Have benefits from free trade been blurred by greed? We do not wish to fall into this trap,"" he said.
Sihasak said the foreign ministers' talks would focus on establishing a common position on terrorism, and finding ways to cooperate to fight infectious diseases like the bird flu which has swept across Asia.
""It's been agreed that we need to work closer together on terrorism and transnational crime, and infectious diseases like SARS and bird flu. The foreign ministers will discuss how to take this further,"" he said.
""I think they will recognise that the challenge now is not just the traditional security issues.""
The bird flu outbreak has killed 18 people in Vietnam and Thailand and emerged in poultry in eight other Asian nations, only a year after the SARS epidemic caused panic as it swept the region.
BIMSTEC leaders were originally due to meet here Monday for the grouping's first summit, but those plans were postponed when Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee cancelled his trip.
BIMSTEC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- Economic Cooperation) was initiated seven years ago by Thailand as part of its ""look West"" policy.

""Only 30 percent of the children are recovered, usually from public places and in factories,"" independent English daily The Kathmandu Post reported Monday quoting the study, which was based on police records and media reports.
During the last four years, 3,022 boys and 2,310 girls were reported lost in the country, among them, 1,194 are below five years of age, 1,598 in the age bracket 6-10, 2,028 in 11-15 and 512 above 15 years.
The study suggests that political turmoil in the Himalayan kingdom has caused an increase in the number of lost children during the last couple of years. After the anti-government insurgency intensified, over 1,000 children belonging to working class families who came to the Kathmandu Valley form neighboring districts were reported lost.
Most of the children disappeared from the streets, public ceremonies and bus stands. Parents, labor agents and neighbors are found responsible for most of such cases. Domestic violence, rejection, fear and strictness in schools and fascination to see the cities are the main reasons behind this, the study said.
Children who have only one parent have been found more vulnerable to losing themselves, the study added.

 Reporters Without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres) strongly condemned abuses inflicted on journalists in Nepal caught between rebels and government, as Maoists kidnapped a third journalist.
 Some seven journalists have been physically assaulted in the past two weeks and the worldwide press freedom organisation said it was very concerned about the plight of Shakti Kumar Pun abducted by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
 It called on the party's leadership not to abduct or harass, and to release Pun, whose kidnapping ran contrary to commitments made by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who in September 2004 ordered his forces to release all journalist hostages and promised an end to violence against the press.
 Pun, correspondent for the national daily Rajdhani, was kidnapped with five other people by a group of rebels in Rukum district in the mid-west of the country. It is not clear exactly when they were abducted but local journalists said it took place sometime around 18 November.
Reporters Sans Frontieres press release, Paris, in English 25 Nov 04
The Maoists admitted kidnapping them to question them without giving any details about where they were being held. They suspected them of collaborating with the army in the arrest of five Maoist leaders last August.
 The same Maoist party is holding two other journalists hostage : Dhana Bahadur Rokka Magar, presenter on Radio Nepal, kidnapped in August 2002 by rebels in the west of the country and Kul Bahadur Malla, correspondent for the newspaper Karnali Sandesh in the west, abducted in June 2003.
 The Maoists murdered kidnapped journalist Dekendra Raj Thapa of Radio Nepal in August 2004 on the grounds that he was a ""spy"".
 Reporters Without Borders is also dismayed by repeated violence against the media by members of the military and the police.
 ""It is something of a paradox to see the government giving journalists' associations financial help for reporters who are victims of abuse and then allow security forces to assault journalists with complete impunity,"" it said in a letter to Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba.
 ""The fight against impunity should be your government's first priority, the organisation's secretary-general added.
 Three journalists received death threats connected to their reporting in the week of 15 November from a criminal, Susheel KC, who is protected by some local authorities in Nuwakot, north of Kathmandu. They were : Dhruba Kumar Rawal, reporter on the daily Rajdhani and Radio Nepal, Devchandra Bhatta, of the daily Nepal Samacharpatra and Raju Mitra Khanal of the daily Himalaya Times.
 Pashupati Ghimire, editor of the weekly News Post published in Dharan, in the east of the country, was manhandled by agents of the security forces in a bus between Barahakshetra and Dharan. The journalist was then forced out and had to complete his journey on foot.
 Producer of the programme ""Samay Chakra"" on Radio Nepal, Prakash Pokharel, has suffered two recent attacks. Businessman Jaya Bhola Shrestha assaulted him on 7 November in Butwal in the west. Then a few days later soldiers in Gulmi, also in the west, assaulted him without any fault.
 Soldiers in civilian clothes assaulted and issued death threats against Prakash Mathema, a photographer with press group Kantipur in south-western Kapilvastu on 9 November. They were angry over publication of one of his photos on the paper's front page the previous day showing an army patrol in which one soldier was carrying a fellow solider who had been wounded in the leg.
 Finally, on 4 November, a group of police officers attacked Surya Bahadur Chanda, of government daily Gorakhapatra in Kanchanpur district in the far-west while he was on a reporting assignment, opposite the offices of the Nepal Electricity Authority.

"7342",20114784,"Title: Krishna, Prachanda in diplomatic duel.rtf; Date: April 24, 2011 Sunday; Text: KATHMANDU: Nepal's Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal's (Prachanda's) meeting with Foreign Minister S M Krishna in Kathmandu on Friday turned into a diplomatic duel with both sides raising their own concerns and denying the other's accusation.
At the meeting with Krishna in a Kathmandu hotel on the last day of the minister's three-day visit, a sombre Prachanda said his attention was drawn to media reports about his party's anti-India activities. Krishna, too, had brought up security and economic issues as well as attacks on the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Rakesh Sood, during the hour-long meeting, the former revolutionary said.
The Maoists have replied to the Indian charges with their own, accusing India of pulling strings during the Maoist government and even afterwards to weaken the party. Prachanda said since the formation of his government in 2008, he felt obstructed, especially during the incidents featuring then chief of the Nepal Army, General Rookmangud Katawal.
Katawal opposed the Maoist bid to merge their People's Liberation Army with the Nepalese Army and had the support of the Indian Army, if not the Indian government. Prachanda's bid to sack Katawal caused his allies to pull out and forced him to resign. The Maoists say India influenced its into deserting them even after initially consenting to remove him.
The second case of obstruction brought up by Prachanda was the prime ministerial poll fiasco.
After Prachanda's successor Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned last year, Prachanda fought the election seven times but failed to win. Although he had got the highest number of votes in the three-cornered fight.

"7099",20081569,"Title: HINDI ROW IN NEPAL.rtf; Date: August 5, 2008 Tuesday 5:51 PM  EST; Text: Guwahati Aug. 05 -- The recent anti-Hindi protests in Nepal may have reflected a strong undercurrent of anti-India sentiments in the Himalayan nation, but the protesters had a point in opposing the use of Hindi by Vice-President Parmananda Jha during the oath-taking ceremony. Indeed, Jha hails from the Indian-origin Madhesi community that largely speaks Hindi, and was fielded by the Madhesi People's Rights Forum for the Vice-President's post in the recent polls. 
But that does not justify the use of the nation's secondary language during a prestigious ceremony like oath-taking, that too by the nascent republic's first Vice-President! Hindi in Nepal isn't quite like what English is in India. The average Nepalese citizen may not disprove of the use of the Indian language in day-to-day affairs or during activities that do not hold much significance. Since Nepali is the principal language of the country as per Constitution, the Nepalese people have a right to assert that the historic swearing-in ceremony must not, in principle, reflect anything having alien flavour. Jha certainly erred on that count, and but for his eventual public apology last week the country would perhaps have remained on the boil a little longer. The Nepalese student bodies withdrew their nationwide agitation after the Madhesi leader apologised, bringing the curtains down on the raging violence.
The controversy, at the same time, exposed some inherent discrepancies too. It proved beyond doubt that anti-India sentiments run unimaginably deep in a country that still elects two Indian-origin persons to occupy the country's top-most ceremonial posts. The magnitude and ferocity of the protests were also utterly questionable. The whole nation was literally set on fire by the protesters and the scale of the violence was frightening. The controversy also reached Nepal's Supreme Court, after a nationalistic lawyer filed a writ calling Jha's action unconstitutional and asking for him to be barred from office till he took the oath again in Nepali. The issue was soon given a political colouring by the Maoists, who incidentally are smarting under the humiliation they suffered in the presidential polls. It is evident that Maoists do not want India to behave like Nepal's Big Brother. And they seemed to grab the sensitive issue with both hands to fuel the controversy. On the other hand, the Indian-origin groups also took up the cudgels on Jha's behalf and used the controversy to display their own strength. Thus Hindi became embroiled in a huge political tug-of-war, threatening to tear Nepal's social fabric apart. The Vice-President probably tried to emphasise the clout of the Madhesi community in Nepalese political affairs by taking oath in Hindi, but his 'comedown' saved the nation from being divided along ethnic lines. The ground realities might still tell a different story, but officially Hindi will have to play second fiddle to Nepali in Nepal, at least to deny nationalist elements any opportunity to disturb peace and harmony.

 Kathmandu, 29 September: A plane of Vega Airlines, a private Bulgarian cargo company, carrying arms for Nepal police, landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Wednesday 29 September . TIA officials confirmed the arrival of the plane.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 30 Sep 04
Constance C. Jones, spokesperson of the US embassy in Kathmandu, confirmed the statement of the American embassy in New Delhi that the arms were meant for training Nepal police personnel. The US embassy in New Delhi, denying that it was a US plane, said the US State Department is training the Nepal police to develop anti-terrorist capabilities and that the plane was carrying equipment for this purpose.
 Jones told the Post that it was part of a regular training programme of the US government to train police forces around the world and denied it was meant for the army.
 The New Delhi statement said the plane carrying equipment for the Nepal police left Bulgaria on Tuesday, landed in India on Wednesday and was cleared to leave for Nepal, according to agency reports.

Ganesh Chiluwal, who was president of the Maoist Victims Association, was in his office in the heart of the capital when gunmen shot him three times, killing him instantly, a police official said.
No one was immediately arrested.
Chiluwal had served as the elected head of a village council at Lamjung in western Nepal at the beginning of the Maoist insurgency and was taken captive by the rebels.
He was released in a police raid and went on to form the Maoist Victims Association to publicise rebel abuses.
His killing came two days after he led a rally in Kathmandu in which protesters burned effigies of Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is better known as Prachanda, or ""The Fierce.""
The rebels, who want to overthrow the monarchy, have frequently targetted perceived local supporters of the Nepalese government during their eight-year insurgency which has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

He told the young officers not to fall prey to attempts to corrupt them and never yield to such temptations. ""Ultimately, you will be judged by the people and there are legendary officers who made this country proud with their impeccable service,"" the home minister added.</p>
<p>
NPA director V N Rai thanked Chidambaram for playing a crucial role in ensuring that the government sanction Rs 200 crore for improvement of training infrastructure at the academy and 274 new posts. He said that the annual budget allocation for NPA has increased by 100% and reached Rs 210 crore this year.</p>
<p>
The 63{+r} {+d} batch included four Royal Bhutan Police officers, four Maldives Police officers and three officers from the Nepal police.</p>

 Two men and two women -- whose names were given as Wojcich Mysiara, Konrad Kakolewjki, Maria Los and Marzena Staniszewska -- left Kathmandu by bus on March 21, saying they were planning to trek to Namboche in the remote Solukhumbu district, considered the gateway to Mt Everest. 
  On Thursday morning, around 9:00am, one of them called up the Nepala Esperanto Associo of Nepal, a group that promotes the constructed language Esperanto, saying they had been abducted by the ""Maoists"". The caller also asked to convey the news to the Poland Embassy in New Delhi as well as Nepal's human rights organisations and ask them to get them released. 
 Two of the four were Esperanto speakers and associated with the Nepala Esperanto Associo. 
 However, since no office bearers were present in the morning and the staff who took the call did not understand Esperanto, no further details were available, said Bharat Kumar Ghimire, secretary general of the association. 
  Appeal 
  Ghimire said he had informed the National Human Rights Commission and other rights organisations, asking them to appeal for the group's release. 
 However, the mystery deepened on Monday with the Maoists denying any involvement in the abductions. Local leaders from Solukhumbu reportedly contacted the Nepali media in Kathmandu and denied having any hand. In the 10 years of the insurgency, the Maoists, though they have demanded money from foreign trekking groups and often been paid for a lark, have not been known to have harmed foreigners. 
 However, there is fear that bandit groups posing as Maoists could be behind the kidnappings. 
 The government authorities had no information about the missing group, neither had the abductors made any demand. 
  The disappearance of the four Poles comes even as a team of French investigators were said to have come to Kathmandu to investigate the fate of Celine Henri, a French tourist who went missing from the Nagarjuna forest reserve in the valley late last year. 
 Henri's disappearance created a sensation as a German woman also disappeared from the same forest around that time and her body was later found in the area.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 31 December
Nepalgunj [mid-west Nepal], 29 December: Businessmen have shut down the town of Nepalgunj demanding compensation for the damage done to their properties during the recent rioting.
The businessmen have warned that they would not reopen the town until the compensations are provided. The Nepalgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industries has been visiting the businessmen individually to console them, fearing the tensions.
Hundreds of shops, hotels, houses and vehicles were damaged when violence erupted between the Madhesi and hill-migrated communities. The businessmen have estimated that physical losses amounted to one billion rupees.
Minister for industries, commerce and supplies Hridayesh Tripathy met the traders of Nepalgunj on Friday [29 December] and assured them that due compensation would be provided. The minister said relief packages would be given by Monday and compensation would be provided immediately after the report of the probe panel is received.
Chief of Nepalgunj chamber of commerce and industries Damodar Acharya said that the town would reopen on Sunday [31 December]. The details of losses during the violence has not been made public yet.
The chamber has formed three separate committees which have started to collect the details of the damage. Acharya said that the details of the losses would be gathered within a few days. ""Large scale damage has been done. We are minutely looking at the details,"" he said. The office of the chamber has been crowded with the people claiming compensations.
The details collected till Sunday revealed that 175 shops were damaged. Gathering of more details is continuing. [Passage omitted: repetition]
The traders are under tension after they had to bear losses in tens of millions. Some of the shop owners were very poor.
The mobile teashops that around the city were also victims of the rioting. After the damage, they have lost the means of their livelihood. ""We have been visiting homes to console and sympathize with the depressed businessmen, said chamber chief Acharya. The businessmen have shut down main areas of the town including Tribhuvan Chowk, Sadar Line and Surkhet Road but the shops in the Ghar Bari area remained open.

Up to 15 rebels entered the health office of the southeastern Udaypur district Wednesday and warned employees to leave before setting off bombs that destroyed the vaccine stock, other medicine and equipment, a security official said.
The Maoists dominate much of the countryside and have regularly targeted signs of central government authority such as government offices, schools and bridges.
Measles is one of the main diseases afflicting cash-strapped Nepal, killing 5,000 of the 133,000 children infected by it in 2003, said Yashovardhan Pradhan, an official in the Child Health Department.
""The Maoist blasts destroyed the measles vaccine stored to immunise children in the district,"" Pradhan said. ""The attack will badly affect the vaccination campaign.""
The immunisation drive began on Tuesday and is expected to cover 9.5 million children between nine months and 15 years across Nepal in three phases up to May. The program aims to halve the country's measles infections.
Some 10,000 people have died in Nepal's civil war since 1996. 
The rebels have been increasing pressure on the government with a two-day strike set for next week during one of the Himalayan kingdom's most important festivals.
The Maoists in August used threats to stop traffic in and out of Kathmandu for one week and to shut down 47 businesses. The industries reopened a month later when the government released two prominent rebels from jail.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday invited the Maoists to resume talks that broke down in August 2003. But he did not offer to meet their key demand: that they not be called a terrorist group, a label which keeps guerrilla leaders in hiding for fear of arrest.
In separate violence Wednesday, suspected Maoists bombed the residence in the western city of Pokhara of Judge Krishna Prasad Bastola, whose brother is a prominent army officer, police said.
No one was injured but police estimated damage at up to 17,000 dollars.

Addressing the US Council of Foreign Relations, Singh said India was committed to facing the challenges posed by globalization and was determined to tackle terrorism, noting defence cooperation was growing rapidly. Referring to ""disturbing signs"" of protectionism in the US, Singh urged Washington to stand firm on free trade. The following is the text of a report by T.V. Parasuram, carried by Indian news agency PTI
 Washington, 24 September: Stressing the need for a ""shared struggle"" against global terror, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Friday 24 September said India and US now have a mature relationship wherein both could cooperate in preventing violence and deprivation of millions of people of dignified lives. ""Our relations have reached a stage of maturity, in which we can manage our differences in a rational and practical manner. There is a mutuality of interests and complementarity of major objectives,"" Singh said, addressing the Council on Foreign Relations here.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 2027 gmt 24 Sep 04
""This is sound basis for a durable partnership in the enterprise we are engaged in - the building of a stable, secure, prosperous and equitable world order. In essence, therefore, my message is simple - we are on the same side. And as I have said before, the best is yet to be.""
 Singh emphasized ""an extraordinary responsibility"" rested on India and the US, of ensuring that the future of mankind is not afflicted by the scourge of violence and large-scale deprivation that denied millions of human beings the dignified lives they deserve. ""History will judge us by our efforts to rid the world of the two menaces of violence and exclusion,"" he said. Singh said the Indo-US relationship has reached a stage where it can serve this larger global cause. India's determination to fight the scourge of terror is second to none, he said, adding that it ""is a shared struggle and one in which we should find it possible to do a great deal more together."" Noting that India for decades has paid a price of terror in human lives that cannot be equalled anywhere, Singh said: ""We have not let it weaken our resolve or undermine the fundamental values on which our society"" is based.
 India is committed to face the challenges posed by globalization, Singh said, adding that his government is committed to ""strengthen and deepen"" reforms so that the country can benefit from the ""tremendous opportunities which the global economy offers today"".
 ""But we will also ensure that there is better distribution of benefits. Our vision of 'inclusive politics' is rooted in a vision of liberal economies,"" he told the audience consisting mainly of American opinion makers. Singh pointed out that recently India and US have embarked on a forward-looking programme which envisages cooperation in civilian space applications, nuclear energy, high technology commerce and a dialogue on missile defence. ""As we move forward on the basis of trust and confidence,"" he said, ""there are ever widening prospects for cooperation in these areas"".
 ""Our defence cooperation is growing rapidly. We also have close cooperation on counter-terrorism, whose benefits are extensive and measurable.
 ""In Nepal and Sri Lanka, the US has supported India's approach in strengthening peace and stability by supporting democratic forces, constitutional processes and political dialogue. In Afghanistan, India strongly supported US-led efforts to replace the repressive Taleban regime and to eliminate the Al-Qa'idah menace. We remain deeply involved in assisting the democratic government of Afghanistan in its national reconstruction efforts.""
 Addressing several investors present in the select audience, Singh said India's growth ambitions need ""massive investments"" in the infrastructure sector. ""United States can play a major role in this area. The United States can also help in sustaining India's efforts to globalize by remaining true to your own traditional commitment to freer trade.""
 Referring to the ""disturbing signs"" of protectionism in the United States, Singh said they run counter to everything America has stood for. When India and other developing countries are beginning to be won over by the persuasiveness of the case for globalization, I hope the arguments will not be lost here.""
 ""We count on the United States standing firm to free trade and open access,"" he emphasized. New partnerships have to escape the straitjacket of old paradigms, Singh said. ""Looking beyond our bilateral relationship I believe we can also be partners in developing a global perspective on creating a new and durable structure for international cooperation.""
 ""It is remarkable that the world order of 1945 dominates global decision-making even today. The architecture of all our major international organizations "

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) Charlotte Benkner, recognized as the world's second-oldest person, died Friday, a funeral home said. She was 114.
The Guinness Book of Records recognized Benkner as the oldest person in the world in November, but it replaced her with a woman from Puerto Rico last month.
Benkner spent her final years rooming with her last living sibling of 10, sister Matilda O'Hare, who died in January at the age of 99.
The two always ate their meals side by side and recited the Lord's Prayer in unison. Both loved music, especially symphonies and the Boston Pops. Benkner's favorite television program was ""The Lawrence Welk Show.""
Guinness initially recognized Benkner as the world's oldest person upon the death Nov. 13 of Mitoyo Kawate of Japan, at 114.
Guinness then gave that distinction to Ramona Trinidad Iglesias Jordan on April 22, after a baptismal certificate showed she was born on Aug. 31, 1889. Benkner was born Nov. 16, 1889.
Kevin Britt
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) Kevin Britt, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids, has died. He was 59.
Co-workers found Britt at his home Sunday morning after they became worried when he did not return several phone calls. He apparently died sometime during the weekend, said Ned McGrath, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Detroit.
McGrath said Britt had canceled all his appointments last week because he hadn't been feeling well, and that no foul play is suspected.
Britt was named coadjutor bishop in Grand Rapids in 2002, where he served with the previous bishop, Robert Rose. In October 2003, Britt took full control of the diocese, which has 102 parishes and represents more than 160,000 Catholics in an 11-county area in southwest Michigan.
Britt spent nearly a decade as an auxiliary bishop in the Detroit before going to Grand Rapids.
Arnold Stirewalt Gridley
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Arnold Stirewalt Gridley, a colorful entrepreneur who invented the ""motorized cable car"" by replacing the cars' regular metal wheels with a truck chassis, died May 8 of kidney failure, family said. He was 92.
After buying some of the city's old California Street cable cars at an auction in 1958, the real estate agent refurbished them and replaced the cars' wheels. The result was San Francisco's first ""motorized cable car,"" which didn't run on cables at all but looked like a traditional cable car and could be driven on any street.
By the time of his death, Gridley had 60 motorized cable cars, which had been used in at least 10 movies, all the Rice-A-Roni commercials and the Super Bowl championship parades of the San Francisco 49ers.
A longtime Democratic Party activist, Gridley also supplied motorized cable cars for politicians to use in their campaigns.
At Gridley's funeral Thursday, his casket was taken to the cemetery in a procession of motorized cable cars.
Anna Lee
LOS ANGELES (AP) Anna Lee, whose nearly 70-year acting career in movies and television spanned from her breakthrough role in ""How Green Was My Valley"" to an extended run on ""General Hospital,"" died Friday of pneumonia, her son said. She was 91.
Paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident just a year after she began playing Lila Quartermaine in ABC's ""General Hospital,"" Lee acted in a wheelchair for more than two decades until she left the soap last year, Byron said.
Born in Kent, England, Lee studied acting in London and was known as ""the British bombshell"" when touring with the London Repertory Theatre, her son said.
In the early 1930s she moved to California to work in Hollywood, and appeared in more than 60 films including ""The Sound of Music"" (1965), ""Fort Apache"" (1948) and ""King Solomon's Mines"" (1937).
In 1982, Lee received an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire award. She is to be honored with a lifetime achievement award at Friday's Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.
Col. Robert Morgan
ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) Col. Robert Morgan, commander of the famed Memphis Belle B-17 bomber that flew combat missions over Europe during World War II, died Saturday of complications from a fall, his wife said. He was 85.
Morgan became famous as the pilot of the Memphis Belle, which flew 25 combat missions over Germany and France during World War II.
The crew completed its 25th bombing mission on May 17, 1943. It was a historic number; the Belle was the first heavy bomber in the European theater to last 25 missions, the magic number to be sent home.
According to Army records, the plane flew 148 hours, dropping more than 60 tons of bombs, all on daylight missions.
Morgan co-authored a book about some of his experiences, ""The Man Who Flew the Memphis Belle,"" with Ron Powers.
Morgan and three other members of the Memphis Belle's crew were made honorary colonels of the state of Tennessee in 2000.
A 1990 film, ""Memphis Belle,"" told a heavily fictionalized version of the bomber's final mission.

''Maoists' youth wing Young Communist League reportedly committed a number of human rights abuses, including abductions and ill-treatment in captivity, assaults and violent disruption of political activities,'' Amnesty International said in its 2008 global report, released on Wednesday. It said the CPN (M) activists were also accused of abductions, torture and killings, including the killing of journalist Birendra Sah. 
It also said police and security forces were involved in torture and rape. ''There were a number of reports of torture and rape by police and members of the security forces, some of whom were off-duty at the same time,'' it said, adding, ''Among those raped were women with mental illness and young girls.'' It said impunity in Nepal has continued due to inaction on the part of police and public prosecutors. ''Police and public prosecutors continued to fail in their duty to investigate and prosecute cases of human rights abuses,'' the report said. Stating that a number of armed groups in Nepal committed human rights abuses, it said factions of Janatantrik Tarai Mukti Morcha were allegedly responsible for unlawful killings, kidnappings and bomb attacks. It said majority of torture victims haven?(EURO)(TM)t yet received any compensation. ''National laws to regulate torture fell short of international standards and were inadequately implemented,'' it said. While launching the report in London, AI Secretary General Irene Khan said, ''The year 2007 was characterised by the impotence of western governments and the ambivalence or reluctance of emerging powers to tackle some of the world?(EURO)(TM)s worst human rights crises, ranging from entrenched conflicts to growing inequalities which were leaving millions of people behind. The report showed that 60 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN, people were still tortured or ill-treated in at least 81 countries, faced unfair trials in at least 54 countries and were not allowed to speak freely in at least 77 countries.

Jhapa, [Monday] 14 August: Workers have forced indefinite closure of all tea estates and factories in the eastern region from Sunday to press the management to meet their demands. The closure has affected some 40,000 persons and cause loss of about 10m rupees daily.
All Nepal Tea Estate Workers' Association, Nepal Tea Estate Workers' Association and Nepal Independent Tea Workers' Union had been staging protests from 3 August to press the management to meet their 21-point demand.
The demands include fixing 5,000 rupees as monthly wages of workers, providing Dashain [Hindu festival] bonus, making the provision of provident fund, providing wages for the duration of their agitation, among others.
The tea workers and the management had held talks for four times, last time yesterday, but could not reach an agreement, said chairperson of Nepal Tea Estate Workers' Association, Deepak Tamang, adding that they announce closure of all tea estates from today. He said the workers hoped that their demands would be fulfilled through agitation only because several rounds of talks did not yield. He was of the view that the government should make an effort to solve the problem. [passage omitted]
Of the 115 tea estates, 17 are run by the government and there are 40 tea-processing plants in the region.

Nepal is scheduled to hold elections April 10 for its Constituent Assembly, a group that will rewrite the constitution and decide the country's future political system.
The former rebels, widely known as Maoists, formally kicked off their election campaign Wednesday with a rally in Katmandu.
""We will fight until the end against those who try to disrupt the elections,"" Prachanda, the leader of the Maoists, told a cheering crowd of 15,000 supporters.
""We will ensure that no one will dare to come between the people and elections and there will be no conspiracy to try disrupt the polls,"" said Prachanda, who uses only name.
The election has already been postponed twice, and the new date only was fixed when the Maoists and six other main political parties reached a landmark agreement to abolish the monarchy immediately after the election and make changes to the election system.
Wednesday's Maoist rally also marked the anniversary of the group's establishment. They began their fight against the government in February 1996 and continued until they gave up their armed revolt and joined the peace process in 2006.
The election for the Constituent Assembly is a key element of the 2006 peace agreement under which the rebels ended their revolt, in which more than 13,000 people died, and joined mainstream politics.

Kathmandu, 2 May: Lekh Nath Neupane, the president of the All Nepal National Independent Students' Union (Revolutionary) [ANNISU-R], the student wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), has said that the Maoists' weapons would not be an obstacle in the peaceful transformation through constituent assembly.
Speaking at an interaction organized at the Reporters' Club, in Kathmandu, Tuesday [2 May], Neupane said the Maoists were committed to the 12-point understanding reached with the seven parties. ""Don't worry about our guns, you need to worry about the guns and point of view of the Royal Nepalese Army [RNA],"" he said. Neupane was of the view that weapons of both parties [RNA and the Maoists] need to be managed in the course of holding constituent assembly. He said the Maoists have not given up armed struggle in policy.
""If the people vote for monarchy in the constituent assembly elections then we will accept that and work again to create awareness among the people,"" he said. When asked if weapons would be used in the awareness campaign, he said, ""Only the military officials of our party [Maoist party] can answer that question.""
On the parties-Maoists understanding, he said: ""The understanding was reached after the Maoists agreed to climb one step down from a people's republic, and the parties agreed to climb one step up and accept a republic.""
Former president of All Nepal National Free Students Union, the student wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Rajendra Rai, said the civil society and the youths should work to make the parties bring out clear view on republicanism. ""The Maoists should make it clear whether or not they have decided that the republican goal can be achieved through peaceful ways,"" Rai said.
Student leader Gagan Thapa expressed concerns over the lack of debate in the political parties on the constituent assembly. ""The constituent assembly will for the first time unite Nepal psychologically, so its process and system should be made clear immediately,"" he said.
While asking everyone to avoid the illusion that no one can scheme against the constituent assembly, Thapa said this is not a time to get tangled in articles and clauses of the constitution.
President of Nepal Students' Union [student wing of Nepali Congress], Mahendra Sharma, said the government should immediately initiate process to talk with the Maoists and create an environment where everyone can vote freely without fear.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 19 November
Kathmandu, [Sunday] 18 November: Senior Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai today asked the Nepali Congress [NC] to give up the leadership of the interim government if it was not ready to implement motions on republic and fully proportional electoral system passed by the special session of the House.
""If the NC is not ready to implement the two motions in the winter session, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala must step down and a new leadership will emerge from within the seven parties,"" Dr Bhattarai said, addressing a rally organised here to mount pressure on the government to implement motions.
He said they had accepted Koirala as PM because of his international stature and his role in the Jana Andolan II [People's Movement].
""If he cannot get the two motions implemented by the regular winter session of the House, he has no moral authority to remain in power,"" Dr Bhattarai said. He said if the NC wanted to lead the government ignoring the decisions of the special session, it will lead to political turmoil. He said Maoists would take to the streets, while raising voice from the House to implement both the motions.
He, however, added that his party still wanted that Koirala led the interim government till the election to the constituent assembly [CA] was held. But the NC must implement the motions passed in the special session.
He also accused the NC of using the Election Commission, which said it needed 110 days to prepare for polls, to defer the election scheduled for June.
""Then we understood the conspiracy behind the poll deferral. Violence in the terai [southern plains], riots in Kapilavastu [district] and a series of blasts in the capital indicate that assembly polls will never be held unless the monarchy was rooted out,"" he said.
Dr Bhattarai said CA polls would not be held unless relief assistance was provided to the families of those who sacrificed their lives in the People's War, the cases of disappearance of over 5,000 people were made public, the plight of the 30,000 People's Liberation Army fighters was addressed and socio-economic changes in the society were effected.
""If the NC wants to hold polls without our participation and without fulfilling our 22-point demands, we challenge it to try and hold polls in the villages,"" he warned.
Meanwhile, the Maoists staged protest rallies in Nawalparasi, Palpa Tansen, Banepa, Hetaunda, Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lamjung [districts] today.

The curfew was imposed from midday Saturday (0645 GMT) to 8:00 pm (1445 GMT), Nepal Television said ahead of a meeting of the country's seven-party opposition alliance to plot the next step in their pro-democracy campaign.
Late Friday, King Gyanendra asked the opposition to name a new prime minister after two weeks of bitter demonstrations demanding the restoration of multi-party democracy in the Himalayan nation.
The three main parties in the alliance immediately said that was not enough and vowed the protests would go on.
The curfew announcement came as protesters gathered at the edge of Kathmandu where felled trees blocked the city's ring road.
A few thousand people massed at Gongabu on the northern edge of the capital, where they threw stones, burnt tyres and kept security forces from the centre of the suburb, an AFP reporter witnessed.
Several hundred also massed in the Kathmandu suburb of Kalimati, chanting: ""We don't believe the king's proclamation. Our movement goes on.""
Gyanendra sacked the government in February last year and assumed absolute control, blaming the country's politicians for failing to quell a Maoist insurgency that has left some 12,500 people dead over the past decade.

  Anti-terrorist squads have been deployed at and around key installations in the country, including nuclear plants, airports and places of large gathering.
  Curfew has been imposed in and around the eight kilometers radius of the two atomic power plants at Kalpakkam since Sunday midnight. The curfew would remain in force from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. The step has been taken as a precautionary measure.
  As an additional security cover, two Naval ships have also been positioned in the seas off Kalpakkam, Navy sources said.
  Security in the national capital has been the tightest since the attack on Parliament on December 13, 2001 following intelligence reports indicating militants' plans to carry out suicide attacks at important and historical places. New Delhi has been declared a no-fly zone for the Independence Day.
  It was decided at a high-level meeting to review security arrangements that no vehicular traffic would be allowed in the areas surrounding the Red Fort from where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will address the nation on August 15.
  Snipers, metal detectors, x-ray machines, sniffer dogs, radio frequency jammers and security cameras were also being deployed and troops armed with machine guns were patrolling the airport in New Delhi.
  Elite commandoes of the National Security Guard (NSG) and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) will guard the Red Fort.
  Policemen, sharp shooters and air defence guns have been put on guard atop the roof-tops of the old Delhi to ward off possible aerial attacks using unmanned aircraft.
  The art of kite-flying which has been associated with the Independence Day celebrations ever since this year it has been banned in the areas near the Red Fort.
  Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) have been deployed at the Indira Gandhi international Airport.
  Intelligence inputs have it that South Delhi figures high on terrorists' hit-list and that Bangladeshi terrorists might use pen pistols to target VVIPS. The security in South Delhi is being reviewed almost on hourly basis and the vehicles were being subjected to random check.
  The Delhi Police has prohibited parking of vehicles outside the Lodhi Garden from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Tuesday for security reasons.
  Surveillance at airports has also been increased. The government has announced strict security measures at airports in the wake of the unearthing of a terror plot in Britain and has banned the carrying of liquids or gels by air travellers.
  Srinagar has been turned into a fortress with security force personnel deployed everywhere to thwart any attempts by militants to disrupt Independence Day celebrations.
  Besides Jammu and Kashmir Police, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has been put on guard.
  ""We are trying to ensure on August 15, people are able to reach the stadium safely, feeling completely safe. So, as far as the red alert that has been sounded of in the rest of the country, we are always alert since there are always chances of militant attack on August 15 or January 26 in Srinagar"" claimed S.N. Sahai, Inspector General of Jammu and Kashmir Police.
  All the roads leading to the entrance of the Bakshi stadium, the main venue of the Independence Day function in Srinagar, have been closed for civilian traffic with heavy contingent of state police and paramilitary forces manning closed roads.
  According to Inspector General of CRPF for Kashmir Police, A P Maheshwari, the forces have conducted incident analysis to follow the changing tactics of the militants.
  ""We are using the best available human resources and equipment such as close circuit cameras, X-ray scanners and explosive detectors and we have also switched from normal policing to non policing methods,"" Maheshwari added.
  Special ID-cards have been issued to security personnel and sharp shooters to avoid a repeat of the May 21 attack on a Congress rally at Shere Kashmir Park in which militants sneaked into a rally disguised as security men and killed three persons.
  Patrolling along the Line of Control has been intensified round-the-clock to prevent infiltration and suicide attacks by the militants. Troops along the border the Pakistan have been put on high alert.

"4943",20061852,"Title: Experts_ Nepal King May Face Charges.rtf; Date: November 20, 2006 Monday 7:56 PM GMT; Text: A government commission blamed King Gyanendra on Monday for a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that left 19 people dead earlier this year, and Nepal's prime minister hinted that criminal charges were possible.
Since April's mass protests, which forced Gyanendra to reinstate parliament 14 months after he suspended it and seized complete power, the monarch has since seen his status plummet from demigod to delinquent. Monday's report was an ominous portent for Nepal's centuries-old monarchy, the last Hindu throne in the world.
In the short term, some legal analysts said it could lead to criminal charges against Gyanendra, who since April has been stripped of his powers, command over the army, and his immunity from prosecution.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala indicated as much when he received the report on Monday, vowing to punish those culpable for the crackdown that killed 19 and injured hundreds.
The commission did not recommend how to proceed, leaving open the thorny question of whether to prosecute the king and how to punish him if he is found guilty.
In the long term, the report's findings are certain to provide ammunition to those looking to do away with the monarchy especially the Maoist rebels, who took part in the April unrest and are now on the cusp of signing a peace deal with the government to which Gyanendra ceded power.
A yet-to-be elected constituent assembly is expected to decide on the monarchy's fate. Centrist parties favor a constitutional monarchy with a ceremonial role for the king.
One member of the government commission that wrote the report, Harihar Birahi, said the king was responsible for the harsh treatment of the protesters because he was chairman of the Cabinet at the time, and that he should be punished. The commission also found 201 other officials in the king's administration responsible for the crackdown.
The commission also sent written questions to Gyanendra, but the king never responded.
On Monday, the palace maintained its silence, offering no public comment on the report.
For many ordinary Nepalis the workers, professionals, housewives and students who took to the streets to force Gyanendra from power the next step was simple: prosecute Gyanendra under the laws he usurped by seizing power.
""The king should be given a fair trial at a court,"" said Ramita Malla, an office worker in Katmandu. ""A case should be filed at a court based on (the commission's) findings, but there should be chance for him to defend too in a civilized and democratic society.""
Krishna Pahadi, a rights activist, said that if the report's findings are ignored and the king goes unpunished, ""impunity will be institutionalized.""
""If the king is not punished then it will only encourage him and his people, who could try once again to take over power,"" he said. ""To prevent all this the king needs to be punished.""
The commission's investigation and its report was the first time any monarch has faced such public scrutiny in Nepal, where kings were traditionally considered reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu.
The Shah dynasty dates to 1769, when a regional ruler named Prithvi Narayan Shah led an army down from the hills and conquered the ancient city of Katmandu.
A 2001 palace massacre, in which the crown prince was accused of gunning down Gyanendra's older brother, the late King Birendra, and much of the royal family and then killing himself, brought Gyanendra to the throne. Four years later, he seized power, saying he would bring order to a chaotic political scene and quell the Maoist insurgency.
But the insurgency worsened, the economy faltered and Gyanendra used heavy-handed tactics to silence the opposition, banning criticism of himself, his government and the army.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in his inaugural speech at the two-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, noted that ""a primary requirement for the fulfillment of our vision of prosperity and cooperation in South Asia is peace.""
""We should therefore implement in a meaningful and sincere manner the commitments and pledges made to root out terrorism so as to create the atmosphere in which our endeavors can succeed,"" he said.
The call was endorsed by several other leaders in their speeches.
Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa said modern-day terrorists operate in a multidimensional fashion.
""They operate politically, militarily, financially and ideologically,"" he said, while calling for working together to evolve a joint strategy to combat terrorism.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai said terrorism has plagued Afghanistan to the detriment of the whole region and other countries of the world.
""It is our common duty to fight terrorism in all its forms, including political sponsorship and financing,"" he said.
SAARC's 14th summit is being participated in for the first time by Afghanistan as its eighth member. The grouping also includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Also for the first time, the summit is being attended by observers from China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and the European Union.
Implementation of the South Asian Free Trade Area, which went into force in January 2006, is another key issue being addressed at the summit. A row between Pakistan and India has delayed its implementation.
Without referring to the row, Singh announced duty free access to the Indian market for SAARC'S less-developed members -- Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives and Bhutan -- without insisting on reciprocity.
""The time has come to move SAARC from a declaratory phase to action and implementation,"" he said.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz did not comment on the calls being made by some SAARC members to evolve a joint counterterrorism strategy or the Indian charge that Pakistan is not implementing the SAFTA agreement.
In the two-day summit, greater people-to-people contact, poverty alleviation, food security, and energy security and cooperation are also on the agenda.
Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said the alleviation of poverty is very important and that the region should make joint efforts to that end.
Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said that instead of allowing SAARC to be a monopoly of governments, it should be more people-centric. He also said that the business communities of all the South Asian countries should get together to promote trade.
SAARC was established in 1985 to foster economic cooperation.

"4236",2005903,"Title: Experts Fear Travel Spurs Exotic Disease.rtf; Date: January 29, 2005 Saturday; Text: American travelers made more than 56 million foreign trips in 2003, up from more than 44 million a decade earlier. They often bring back germs that can take weeks or months to cause symptoms and diseases, which American doctors may be slow to recognize.
Kevin Keogh spent the morning doing ordinary chores. By afternoon, he was climbing out the window of his Mercedes and onto the roof as it sped down a busy street. Standing on top of the car, his arms outstretched as if he were surfing, he jumped to his death.
What would make the chief financial officer for the city of Phoenix do something so bizarre?
One theory is a parasite doctors believe he caught on a trip to Mexico several years earlier. The bug can live for years inside the body, travel to the brain and cause seizures and hallucinations - symptoms Keogh started suffering a few months after his trip.
His death in December may be an extreme example of an exotic illness picked up in a foreign land. It's a goes-with-the-territory downside that many people underestimate when they venture into territory far from their back yards.
It took eight months for doctors to figure out Keogh's illness, said his wife, Karlene. A blood test showed he had cysticercosis, a parasitic illness often acquired from undercooked pork and common in Latin and Central America. Dr. Rebecca Hsu of the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's office said that early tests did not reveal the parasite in his brain. However, that evidence doesn't always show up, she said. More tests are pending to try to determine the cause of death.
""He was in excellent health, otherwise. Whether he was in his right mind or not, no one can say,"" Hsu said. ""I do believe something horrible happened to this poor man.""
Keogh had traveled to a remote part of Mexico to explore artifacts and ruins, which he loved. A growing number of Americans are traveling overseas and to more non-traditional tourist destinations.
""Paris, London, Rome used to be exotic travel,"" said Dr. Phyllis Kozarsky, an Emory University professor and senior travel health consultant to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Now people want to outdo each other"" by heading for more obscure destinations.
Usually, the risk is limited to the traveler because most germs aren't easily spread person-to-person, Kozarsky said. But SARS showed some germs can affect public health. Another example is American travelers who returned with malaria which was then passed onto mosquitoes that bit them back home in the Carolinas, New York City and Palm Beach, Fla. These mosquitoes then bit local residents who had no reason to suspect they had a tropical disease because they hadn't gone anywhere tropical.
Some illnesses are especially harmful to children, said Dr. Tina Tan, medical director of the travel clinic at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
""We've seen kids come back with malaria,"" and unusual spider or insect bites, she said. ""A lot of times they go unrecognized for a while because they're going to their pediatrician or family doctor, and they don't think about exotic diseases.""
Illness can be more annoying than the easily treated ""travelers' diarrhea"" that develops in half of all people who visit a developing country for two weeks or longer.
A Minnesota town is the namesake of Brainerd diarrhea, first identified there in 1984. Dr. Robert Tauxe, head of foodborne illness at the CDC, calls it ""diarrhea for life."" It sickened 200 people on successive voyages on a small boat around the Galapagos Islands in 1992. A 1998 report on the outbreak found many still suffering from it.
""We've studied it extensively, but to this day we don't know the cause of this yet. We don't know if it's a virus or bacteria or what,"" Tauxe said.
Mary Steigerwald, a Phoenix nurse who is vice president of communications for Ottawa University, knows that kind of misery. Doctors think she got a parasite on a trip to Asia, where she felt pressured to eat things like shark-fin soup at business meetings. She had diarrhea for 18 months.
""I went through eight different courses of antibiotics. Nothing could stop it,"" she said.
Tauxe teases his sister, Lisa Tauxe, a geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., who got hepatitis from a trip to Africa. She doesn't know what did it: the miniature zoo in the water she swallowed while windsurfing in a polluted bay or the raw sea urchin she had afterward.
""It walked across my plate as I was trying to eat it. It's sushi. It's stupid. I don't do that anymore,"" she said.
The boom in extreme travel and adventure tourism has some health experts worried.
""Many people feel that their lives are overly routine, overly bureaucratized, that they're constrained by institutions,"" said Lori Holyfield, a University of Arkansas sociologist who has studied people who seek ultimate experiences like rock-climbing in remote places. ""They don't want real danger, just the feel of flirting with it.""

 Students affiliated to opposition political parties took to streets in Kathmandu as soon as the government announced significant hike in the prices of petroleum products Monday 10 January afternoon. Protests still continue at various places in the capital city.
 Agitating students smashed at least three government vehicles at Putalisadak and Sohrakhutte area while demonstrations still continued at Bagbazaar, Lainchour and Putalisadak. The Nepal Students Union, sister organization of the Nepali Congress, said it would continue protests against the government decision. Security presence has been stepped up in and around these areas.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 10 Jan 05
Earlier, after a meeting of the Council of Ministers Monday, the government hiked prices of petroleum products based on the recommendation of an advisory committee under National Planning Commission vice-chairman Dr Shankar Sharma. Minister for Commerce, Industry and Supplies Iswore Pokhrel had proposed for the price hike arguing that it was the only alternative to save the state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) - that enjoys monopoly in the import and sales of petroleum products in the country - from bankruptcy.
 This is the third time the Deuba government has increased the fuel prices in five months.
 The price of per litre of petrol has been fixed at 62 rupees from 56, kerosene 41 rupees from 35 and Liquified Petroleum Gas at 850 rupees from 750 per cylinder. Subsidized kerosene will be sold at 30 rupees per litre while the price of aviation fuel has been fixed at 48 rupees per litre. The new price setup will come into effect from today, officials said.
 Speaking at a function to mark NOC's anniversary this afternoon, Minister Pokhrel said price hike was necessary to match the prices to that in the international market and save the NOC from going bust.
 ""We had only two options - price hike or suicide,"" he said declaring that the government was ready to resist all kinds of protests against the decision.
 The NOC has been running a monthly loss of 480m rupees while it has a debt of 2.26bn rupees to clear, according to reports.

The expulsions wrecked hopes the nuclear-armed neighbors might soon begin talks to settle their perennial dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
India ordered Jalil Abbas Jilani, acting head of Pakistan's diplomatic mission in New Delhi, to leave the country and accused him of funneling money to separatists in the Indian part of Kashmir. Hours later, Pakistan expelled Sudhir Vyas, the acting Indian high commissioner in Islamabad.
The two nations also expelled four other officials from each other's embassy.
Navtej Sarna, spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs, accused Pakistan of pursuing a path of ""confrontation and compulsive hostility and brinksmanship.""
In Islamabad, Pakistani Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the expulsions were an attempt by India to derail any prospects of improved relations.
""We condemn this move, and India has proved that it does not want peace in the region,"" Ahmed said.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and nearly went to war again last year. Though they have since withdrawn many troops from their border, they continue to trade insults and have recently also been conducting missile tests.
While expulsions are not uncommon, these were the second round this year. Four diplomats from each side were expelled last month.
India and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors last year after an attack on India's Parliament in December 2001. India blamed the attack on Pakistan's spy agency and two Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups.
Intense international pressure defused much of the tension and the hostile neighbors began pulling back their armies from the border to peacetime locations in October. However, the ambassadors have not returned.
New Delhi has long accused Islamabad of backing the 12-year insurgency in Kashmir, which is divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors. Both countries claim the region in its entirety and have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.
On Saturday, India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee accused Pakistan's spy agency of also using the territories of neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh to pursue its anti-India agenda.
""For us, the most disconcerting aspect of terrorism is that it is sponsored, supported and funded by Pakistan as a matter of state policy,"" Press Trust of India quoted Vajpayee as saying at a political conference in New Delhi.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan said Pakistan wanted a peaceful resolution and quick negotiations with India to find a lasting peace in the troubled region.
""India will not find us wanting in responding to any gesture of good will,"" Khan said.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 24 March
Kathmandu, 24 March: In a divided verdict, the Supreme Court on Friday [24 March] ruled that the ""controversial"" provision in the anti-terrorism law, popularly known as TADO [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance], which allows security forces to detain a person suspected of terrorist activity for one year, is in keeping with the present constitution.
Quashing a writ petition that questioned the constitutionality of the provision on the ground that it was against human rights, Justices Khil Raj Sharma and Gauri Dhakal said, ""The provision is in tune with the constitution as even the Public Security Act promulgated by parliament entertains preventive detentions by the authorities.""
However, Justice Bal Ram KC, writing a dissenting opinion, said, ""The provision contravenes the constitution.""
TADO, according to KC, is a penal law but the provision in question is preventive law. ""Preventive law cannot be incorporated in penal law,"" he said reading out his opinion.
Justice KC further added that if the provision were not declared contradictory to the constitution, the state could both prosecute and keep citizens in preventive detention at the same time.
The provision in the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance, 2005 has drawn flak from national and international human rights organizations, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists.
They say the provision does not conform to national and international human rights instruments. The court passed the divided verdict in reply to a writ petition filed by advocates Raju Prasad Chapagain and Prakashmani Sharma of Pro-Public, an NGO.
SC sanctions terrorist tag on Maoists
The Supreme Court on Friday also sanctioned the government decision labelling Maoists as ""terrorists"" and banning rebel activities.
Quashing a petition that questioned the constitutionality of the government decision, a full bench comprising Justices Khil Raj Regmi, Badri Kumar Basnet and Gauri Dhakal said the petition could not produce sufficient evidence to substantiate that the CPN [Communist Party of Nepal] (Maoist) was a political party with constitutional recognition.
The government decided to tag CPN (Maoist) as ""terrorist"" and ban the outfit's activities on 28 August 2003. Tara Nath Ghimire had moved the apex court over the decision.

""Both the government and the Maoists (rebels) have agreed to release those being held captive and refrain from kidnapping or arresting each other's people,"" government peace negotiator Naranyan Singh Pun said.
In a rare joint news conference, Pun and Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a rebel leader, announced guidelines for peace talks, which they said would be held soon. They did not give a date.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish the constitutional monarchy and establish a socialist state in this Himalayan kingdom. More than 7,000 people have been killed in the insurgency. The rebels and the government declared a cease-fire in January.
""We are hopeful the government will immediately release all our people in custody,"" Mahara told the news conference. ""We have also ordered all our people to free everyone being held by us.""
Hundreds of rebels have been arrested by government forces since emergency rule was imposed in November 2001. Mahara refused to say how many government troops and officials are being held by the rebels.
In January, the rebels decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescind a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and cancel a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.

""According to the doctors involved in prime minister's medical treatment, he (the PM) will not be able to be present at today's sitting of the house,"" said Subash Nemwang, the speaker of the house of representatives.
In place of the 85-year old Girija Prasad Koirala, Deputy Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli will present government programmes for the next 12 months and recap the last four years.
Parliament was suspended in 2002 by King Gyanendra who then sacked the cabinet in February 2005 and seized absolute power. It was reinstated in April following weeks of bloody protests against his rule led by political parties and Maoist rebels. 
Since his appointment, Koirala has been dogged by ill health. 
He recently returned from nine days in Bangkok receiving laser prostate treatment and is currently recovering from a bout of pneumonia.
In past years, the king would present the political programme, but he was removed from any political rule by parliament in June.
The policy announcement is expected to detail efforts by the government and rebels to share power after the drafting of an interim constitution. 
In addition, the government has agreed to a key Maoist demand for the election of a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution.
Since the rebels began their ""people's war"" in 1996, at least 12,500 people have been killed.

China has also lodged an official protest with the United States over Wednesday's protest, in which the Americans called for Tibetan independence and voiced outrage at the 2008 Olympic torch passing through the Himalayan region.
""Upon discovering this activity, a border unit of China's public security bureau stopped the protest and according to... relevant laws will expel these people outside of China,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
The Americans had unfurled banners demanding a ""free Tibet"" and protested against plans to take the Olympic torch to the top of the mountain ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games, according to US-based Students for a Free Tibet.
Police immediately detained four of the protesters at the scene, while the fifth American was apparently taken into custody later, as Chinese authorities had previously said that one person had fled base camp.
Students for a Free Tibet, which organised the protest, confirmed that the protesters had been expelled from Tibet and insisted that the group would continue to protest against China's oppressive policies there.
""They called us from the border, they were expelled at the Nepal border, they are on their way to Kathmandu,"" said Lhadon Tethong, a spokeswoman for the group in the Nepalese capital.
""They said they were all together, we are thrilled that they are here safely.""
She said the group would continue to protest against China's occupation of Tibet, especially in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
""The occupation of Tibet remains and we will continue to protest China's political use of the Olympic Games to legitimise their control of Tibet,"" she said.
The group said China was trying to whitewash widespread religious and cultural oppression in Tibet through its Olympic activities.
China has ruled Tibet since sending troops in to ""liberate"" the region in 1951 and has violently suppressed a number of uprisings since then.
The ministry statement said the Chinese government had lodged an official complaint with the United States over the protest and demanded that Washington prevent similar incidents from occurring.
""Tibet is an inseparable part of China and the Chinese government and people will never tolerate any activity aimed at splitting China,"" the statement said.
""The United States should work to dispel the odious influence of this (protest) and prevent similar incidents from occurring.""
The protest came a day before the Beijing Olympic Games organisers formally announced plans to bring the Olympic torch to the top of the world's highest peak, while also sending the torch relay through Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.

The security forces launched air attack after clashes with the Maoists that have been continuing for the past few days.
Six people of one family, including a woman, were injured in the air raid. The security forces launched the air attack after a two-hour clash with the rebels on Tuesday [28 February].
Three army helicopters were chasing the Maoists. Bullets fired from the helicopters hit the shop of a local shopkeeper in Khidim, Baburam Parajuli. A bullet entered the shop, making a hole in the tin roof and hitting a 14-year-old student, Pawan Gautam.

Home Minister Krishna Sitaula said the decision was reached at Friday's Cabinet meeting. The election is a key part of the Himalayan nation's peace process, which saw communist rebels give up a decade-long armed revolt.
An election for the Constituent Assembly which would rewrite Nepal's constitution and decide on a new political system for the Himalayan nation was first scheduled for June 20 but was postponed because the government failed to enact sufficient election laws.
A second poll set for Nov. 22 was pushed back after the Maoists former rebels who only months earlier had ended an insurgency and joined the political mainstream withdrew from the government.
The elections were a key stage agreed to in the 2006 peace process to end the Maoists' decade-long communist insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead. The Maoists quit the government in September because the ruling alliance did not agree to their demands for the immediate abolition of the monarchy and procedural changes to the elections.
The government and the Maoists agreed last month to abolish the centuries-old monarchy immediately after the elections. The Maoists have since rejoined the government.
Nepal's unpopular King Gyanendra seized power in February 2005, citing the government's inability to quell the communist insurgency. Weeks of street protests forced him to give up his authoritarian rule in April 2006. Since then Gyanendra has been stripped of his powers and command of the army.

Known as the ""Bikini Killer,"" Frenchman Sobhraj was tried by a Nepali court in 2004 and convicted for the 1975 murder of an American woman, for which he was jailed for 20 years.
He is now appealing his sentence before the Supreme Court, arguing that he was not in Kathmandu at the time Connie Joe Bronzich was repeatedly stabbed and her body burnt almost beyond recognition.
""I really didn't do it, and I think I will be out,"" Sobhraj told AFP in a recent interview.
""In my case, there are no documents and no witnesses (to the crime). I think that the court will have to free me,"" said Sobhraj, whose is also known as ""The Serpent"" for brazen escapes from prisons in Greece, Afghanistan and India.
The date for the next hearing in the appeal which opened in December is expected to be set soon.
As families tried to shout to other prisoners in the clamour of a crowded visitors' room in Kathmandu's crumbling central jail, Sobhraj's immaculate appearance stood in stark contrast to his decrepit surroundings.
The still handsome Sobhraj -- who is half-Vietnamese, half-Indian -- has been linked to a string of poisonings, killings and robberies of backpackers across Asia in the 1970s -- events that led to the ""Bikini Killer"" sobriquet.
Thai police wanted to question him about five deaths, and Indian authorities convicted him of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and other charges, eventually freeing him in 1997 after 21 years of detention.
In 2003, Sobhraj, described by police as a persuasive con man, was arrested in a Kathmandu casino where he said he was doing research for a television documentary.
He was convicted the following year of Bronzich's killing and the verdict was upheld by a higher court. His lawyers argue the evidence against him was fabricated.
His conviction rests largely on the evidence of handwriting experts who said the signature on hotel registration slips from 1975 matched his.
But Sobhraj, 62 years old and a self-taught martial artist, said the photocopied slips were forged. His lawyers have asked to see the originals but so far they have not been produced.
-- ""You can run but you can't hide"" --
Raja Ram Dhakal, one of Sobhraj's five lawyers, said: ""Photographs and photocopies are not reliable evidence because they can be fabricated. There is no original evidence, no direct evidence and the chain of circumstantial evidence is not established.""
Sobhraj said during his trial and maintains today that he had never visited Nepal before his arrest.
But a retired police officer who identified Sobhraj during the Supreme Court appeal hearing believes the right man is behind bars.
""Finally the killer has been brought to justice. You can commit a crime and you can run, but you cant hide,"" 79-year-old Chandra Bir Rai told AFP.
In dramatic court testimony late last year, Rai said he had seen Sobhraj in Nepal in 1975, contradicting the convict's claim never to have been in the country before.
""His claim that he did not visit Nepal before 2003 is false,"" Rai told the court.
Speaking to AFP, he reiterated his testimony. ""I am sure that this is the same man we saw in 1975,"" he said.
""No murder charges in other countries were ever proved -- this might have encouraged him to think that would be the same here. He took Nepali police too lightly.""
The driver of a car hired in 1975 by the man who police believe is Sobhraj also identified him in court.
""Though I cannot remember all the events, I can at least remember Sobhraj's face,"" Purna Bahadur Maharajan said in court.
Rai was not involved in investigating the murders of foreign nationals until the remains of Bronzich, a Californian, and her Canadian male friend Laurent Carriere were found at two roadside locations in the Kathmandu valley in late December 1975.
-- Finger of suspicion pointed at Sobhraj --
The bodies of Bronzich and Carriere were found two days apart. Carriere had also been repeatedly stabbed and burnt. Sobhraj faced trial only for Bronzich's murder.
""Murder charges in the second case were also filed, but over past 20 years the police records of the Carriere case were misplaced,"" said Bishwalal Shrestha, a lawyer who was the police officer in charge of investigating the grisly murders.
Rai said that when he first met Sobhraj, he was unknown to Nepali police.
""At that time we didn't know anything about (Sobhraj), but he was a suspect and we kept him under surveillance at his hotel,"" said Rai.
Villagers near where the bodies were found said they knew nothing about the murders.
But friends of the victims pointed the finger of suspicion at a Vietnamese gem dealer whom Broznich had met, accoording to Richard Neville and Julie Clark in their detailed book ""The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj,"" published by Jonathan Cape in 19"

 The responsibility of the state rises with the worsening of the country's peace and security situation.
 The slightest laxity or hesitation on the part of the state will result in a widespread effect on the general public. The duty and responsibility of the state has risen with the spread and pervasive nature of the violent Maoist rebellion. It is enough for the state just to monitor and give directives in situations where the civil society is strong. We have already had this experience once. But the state must be more attentive and cautious in providing relief and services to the general public in crisis situations. When the civil society becomes weak, fearful and terrorized, the responsibility and the role of the state should be such that it rise spontaneously to meet the needs of society.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 14 Oct 03 p6
News is out about districts such as Achham being in food crisis because of blockades imposed by Maoist rebels. Eleven villages of Bajura District in the Karnali Zone are already facing starvation because of the laxity and carelessness of government employees.
 This is a serious and sensitive matter. If the situation had been normal, then it would not be much of a headache for the government to avert food crises such as those of Achham and Bajura.  Bajura's food crisis reportedly arises from drought rather than being man-made.  But in the current situation, the state has to take the added responsibility for making arrangements for food along with security provisions.
 The government, and the policy-makers, must understand that the civil society is not in a state to solve the food crisis by itself. There is no way we can reach food supplies to Achham without the support of the state. So the government must resolve, by whatever means possible, the problems of the Achhami people who are in the folds of food crisis because of Maoist blockade. The slightest laxity on the part of the government in such sensitive questions will have a very bad effect on the people.
 On the question of Bajura's food crisis, direct laxity and carelessness has been seen on the part of the administration. Bajura's hunger did not come about just because of its remoteness, it has to do more with the duties and the responsibility of our administration. Officers at the Kolti depot in Bajura are reported to have left their posts and handed over the responsibility to a guard there. This difficulty may prevail in other places also, but may not have come to the fore due to the lack of reporting.
 The state must immediately focus on matters such as these, which appear simple on the surface but are actually very serious and of a very sensitive nature from the human angle. The situation cannot be termed as general when you cannot buy food even when you have money to pay for it.
 When the whole country is not in a normal situation, it may not be unnatural for the people to undergo suffering, pain and discomfort at times. Nonetheless, some recent incidents have made us feel strongly about it. Travellers on long-route journeys by bus are also facing problems. Travelling time which ordinarily would take 12 hours now takes 36 hours to complete because of intermittent security checks and regular curfew orders. The state should apply sense in such matters. If the administration arranges to seal baggage after checks at the starting point, then it would end the situation where travellers need to stand in queues for long hours time and again at many points along the route. The state needs to give special attention to everyday problems that people are having to face, not just to big incidents and problems.

     As an increasing number of people visit Tibet, witness the  region's changes and learn about its history and the thoughts of  the local residents, many foreign media outlets have begun to  reexamine the issue and question the Dalai Lama's motives. In a  recent article, Yi Duo outlined those voices.  REPRESENTATIVE OF A FEW
    The Dalai Lama can only represent a few Buddhists and it is  therefore wrong to equate him to Buddhism, said some German media  when he visited Germany as a religious leader in July. Welt am  Sonntag and the online edition of Die Welt quoted sources from  Deutsche Buddhistische Union as saying that though it is good to  have the Dalai Lama speak for Buddhism, he is not expected to  overshadow other Buddhist sects. The newspapers said most of the  Buddhists across the world, including those in Germany, are not  followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Also, the Dalai Lama advocates  pessimism about the afterlife, a theory that runs counter to the  optimistic Buddhist doctrine that self-cultivation in this world  can lead believers to paradise in the other world.
    Some Germans who have been to Tibet have rejected the Dalai  Lama's anti-China rhetoric. Der Spiegel magazine published a  letter to the editor on July 23 saying those who had recently been to Tibet found what the Dalai Lama had done was ridiculous.  Thousands of Tibetans offer their prayers in and near the Jokhang  Monastery every day, the number of monks in temples is on the rise and many Buddhists travel to Lhasa to attend prayers from across  China, the letter said. Another reader expressed bewilderment over the Dalai Lama. In a letter to Der Spiegel, he said the Dalai Lama has attempted to become an ""omnipotent pope."" But why does he  oppose the Christian doctrine of ""improving the world"" and insist  on ""overcoming the World?"" The reader believes the Dalai Lama's  ultimate goal remains elusive.
    Die Welt published an article coauthored by Victor Trimondi and Victoria Trimondi, in early August, criticizing Germans who  consider the Dalai Lama the ""Jesus Christ of the new era"". It is  wrong to take the Dalai Lama's religion as a moderate one, because the history of Tibet is far from peaceful, the article said. Tibet did not end its dark medieval period until the mid 20th century.  Before that, it was plagued by violence, wars and power struggles  under the name of religion. The religious trials held under the  Lama regime were no different from those under the Catholic rule  during the medieval days, it said.
    In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the article, disciples were  required to strictly obey their masters, making it impossible for  Tibetans to pursue individuality and independence, let alone  create their own fate. Old Tibet was under an extremely  hierarchical regime featuring the combination of political and  religious power. Given these facts, Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama drew worldwide criticism in the late 1990s, the authors said. Even the Dalai Lama had to admit the dark side of Tibetan history, they added.
    The article revealed some fundamentalist features of Tibetan  Buddhism, such as combined political and religious power,  alienation of women, belief in devils, sexual and psychological  abuse and corruption. The Dalai Lama voiced support for women's  participation in religious leadership -- possibly becoming the  next Dalai Lama -- in Hamburg. At the same time, he indicated that he had no right to grant religious posts to women.  CAPITALIZING ON WESTERN FEARS
    The Dalai Lama clique's anti-China political propaganda has  angered some Germans. Nicole Graaf, a German scholar of Tibetan  studies, said in an article published by the Berlin-based Der  Tagesspiegel newspaper on July 22 that the Dalai Lama clique  exercises strict ""press censorship."" All texts and pictures  depicting the dark old Tibet and positive images of new Tibet have been taken out of its brochures, she said. For example, there is  no mention of the armed offensive the Dalai Lama clique launched  against China from Nepal with the help of the U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the 1960s or the cruel rule of  Tibetan serfdom.
    She said the Dalai Lama's argument that China carries out  ""systematic cultural genocide"" in Tibet is not valid. Despite the  problems in China, Tibetan residents live normal religious, social and economic lives.
    The article said the Dalai Lama clique asks for financial aid  from the West in the name of religion and human rights. However,  instead of spending money on those badly in need of help, the  leading members in the clique buy golden watches and luxurious  cars for themselves with donations from the West while their  sponsors know nothing about these deeds.

Text of unattributed report entitled ""Nepal to provide joint security at suspected disposal site of disappeared bodies"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 25 December
Kathmandu, 24 December: The government is to put in place a joint security mechanism for a site in the Alle jungles in the Shivapuri hills [north of the capital] out of suspicion that those killed [allegedly by the army] while in custody were disposed of there.
The secretaries of various government ministries who were present at a meeting of parliament's Human Rights and Social Justice Committee on Monday [24 December] said that a joint mechanism would be worked out. Defence Ministry Secretary Baman Prasad Neupane said: ""The mechanism will soon augment security at the site of the incident and help in the investigations"".
""Police can do the needful to provide security at the incident site under army's coordination "", he said - ""It is not right to include the army in the mechanism as it stands accused of Maoists' disappearance"". However the army will lend its cooperation, he said.
He was of the opinion since the evidence uncovered could disappear, the National Human Rights Commission which is involved in investigations has to act fast.
At the meeting, officials of the home affairs and forest ministries said they were ready to lend their cooperation in the commission's investigations. Committee member K.P. Oli of the CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist] accused the government of not cooperating with the commission in safeguarding the evidence found at the suspect site. ""This is a very serious matter, the government should act with sensitivity"", he said: ""The government has not been meeting its responsibility"".
Another member of the commission, Kamala Pant, said suspicious have grown as the government has not assigned security personnel even a week after the suspect site was found. ""Let the government assign police for the security of the incident site"", she said.
Last Wednesday [19 December], representatives of the commission, the UN Office of High Commission for Human Rights, members of families of the disappeared, rights workers and journalists inspected the incident site. Experts from the commission had gone to the incident site on Saturday [22 December] and took away pieces of clothing, plastic and half-burnt wood for laboratory testing.

Responding to last week's formal letter from the government inviting the rebels to sit down for a third round of negotiations, chief rebel negotiator Baburam Bhattarai said King Gyanendra himself should take part in the talks to legitimize them.
The king should otherwise make public announcements to the effect that the government negotiating team is authorized to make decisions and that he would fully implement any decisions taken, Bhattarai said in his reply given to the government Wednesday through talks facilitators.
The rebel leader also accused the army of consistently violating an agreed code of conduct following the January cease-fire as part of preparations for military rule of the country.
In the process, Nepal has allowed hundreds of military experts and advisers from the United States into the country, he said, and demanded the deportation of all foreign military experts and advisers.
He also reiterated the rebels' demand that the government should honor and implement the decisions of the second round of talks, which included limiting the movement of the army to 5 kilometers from barracks or bases.
The government should spell out its position on the rebels' political demands, mainly on a new Constitution, before going for a third round, he said.
The rebels, who took up arms against the Nepalese government in 1996, held two round of peace talks with the previous government, following a cease-fire in January this year.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to abolish the monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal, though they now say they would settle for constitutional monarchy and allow multiparty democracy.

The surgery on Laleh and Ladan Bijani, 28, could happen as early as next week, an official from the Raffles Medical Group said on condition of anonymity.
But a source close to the twins said doctors have asked them to invite one or two close relatives to Singapore to stay with them before the operation. Waiting for them to arrive could delay the surgery until early July, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The two sisters have tried for years to persuade doctors to attempt the procedure without success. German doctors concluded in 1996 that surgery could kill one or both of the sisters because they share an artery that feeds blood to their brains.
Last year, doctors in Singapore said they believed the surgery was possible, but that the decision on whether to proceed would be left up to the twins.
""They seem determined to go through with this,"" Dr. Keith Goh, head of the team of surgeons working with the twins, said last December.
The hospital announced Friday that it will hold a news conference on Monday on the separation surgery.
X-rays and scans revealed two separate brains surrounded by one skull, doctors have said. If the surgery is successful, the women will be left with palm-sized cavities on their heads.
After a lifetime of sacrifices to accommodate each other, the women have said they do not want to live joined together any longer.
Their hopes of living separate lives were rekindled last year when they read about how Goh separated a pair of Nepalese infants who were similarly fused at the skull. The sisters arrived in Singapore on Nov. 20 from their home in Tehran, Iran, to undergo medical and psychological evaluations.
Laleh hopes the surgery will allow her to pursue her dream of working as a journalist in Tehran, while Ladan wants to earn a graduate degree in law and move back home with their parents in Shiraz.

But at the height of weekend protests, the wide crossroads was covered with rocks, tear gas canisters and a large amphibious vehicle mounted with a heavy machine gun stood in the centre of the road.
Several massive fires of burning tyres blocked the main road as a line of soldiers crouched in the road and pointed M16 rifles at the mob of stone-throwing protesters.
Kalanki falls just outside the curfew area and was one of at least 10 places on the outskirts of the capital where clashes took place Sunday, according to human rights workers.
The standoff began before noon and was still going by early evening.
Protesters chanted anti-royal slogans, rained down bottles and bricks on the police and soldiers, who would periodically charge forward, scattering the protesters.
""The police had been showing restraint during the day, but that has stopped now,"" said Brian Cobb, a US doctor in charge of a small group of medical volunteers who had been treating protesters and police throughout the day.
""There have been about 20 police injured and a lots of protesters,"" he said.
As darkness fell and police and soldiers baton-charged the crowd, police flushed out demonstrators from hiding places and beat, punched and kicked them as they dragged them to civilian vehicles.
Police shoved journalists and told them to leave, and a human rights worker was hit with a bamboo pole as he tried to stop police beating a protester.
""You've got him already, why beat him more,"" the rights worker said as three police officers hit and kicked a bleeding protester.
A police inspector told AFP that there had only been a handful of arrests at Kalanki Sunday, but in an hour and a half, at least six badly beaten protesters were loaded into civilian vehicles to be taken away.
Driving away from the junction towards the town centre, four more huge fires blocked the road, and groups of young people stood by with rocks ready to pelt passing security forces.
Authorities have said that Maoist rebels have infiltrated the protests and that the curfew, a protest ban and the arrest of hundreds of political activists was necessary to preserve security in the troubled nation.

Excerpt from unattributed report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 19 June
Kathmandu, 18 June: The main parties in the ruling coalition have expressed dissatisfaction over the government entering into agreement with the Maoists on important questions without holding internal discussions within the parties.
The CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist], the Nepali Congress and the Nepali Congress (Democratic) have expressed concern that the agreement to dissolve the House of Representatives, which was taking forward looking decisions in favour of the people, will bring about a political void in the country.
The CPN-UML has shown serious concern over some of the points on which the government and the Maoist summit meeting agreed and voiced dissatisfaction over the government's working procedure.
At a meeting of the party standing committed held Saturday [17 June], most members said not enough discussion had taken place with the seven parties on a serious matter like drafting an interim constitution and dissolving the House of Representatives. Some members said the government's functioning was not transparent nor sound of procedure.
[Passage omitted: a quote from a standing committee member containing repetition]
The failure to keep the top leadership of the parties informed about the home minister going to meet Prachanda at Siklesh [place in western Nepal] has been taken seriously. [Passage omitted: details] The same member raised suspicion on the procedure adopted and also said if things proceed in this fashion without taking the seven parties into confidence, the agreement will not be fruitful [Passage omitted: details]
The CPN-UML concluded that ignoring of the all-party peace committee while working out the govrnment-Maoist agreement and devaluing House of Representatives committees also have given rise to suspicions.
The member also said the secrecy of the talks between the prime minister and Prachanda raised suspicion about other forces being deliberately sidelined [Passage omitted: details] Leaders including party General Secretary Ram Chandra Paudel met with the talks team convenor and members and voiced their anger over the agreement to dissolve parliament. Congress leaders commented to the government that agreeing to form an interim government without first discussing the management of weapons was a hasty decision. Pointing out that the Maoists have not stopped their killings and abductions, nor returned property of political workers and the general public that they had seized forcibly, the Nepali Congress has urged the government to get the Maoists to abide by the agreement.
A meeting of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) central committee and parliamentary party held Sunday [18 June] said that the government-Maoist agreement had some positive points but expressed dissatisfaction over dissolution of the house.
[Passage omitted: agenda of the meeting]
After the meeting NC(D) member of parliament Bal Bahadur KC questioned how parliament, reinstated by the popular movement, inconvenienced anybody [Passage omitted: details of the argument]
The meeting pointed out that peace would not materialize without taking care of the weapons, and expressed anger over the decision to form an interim government. ""What the people want is peace, and without laying down of arms it cannot be said that there is peace. The people are terrorized"". Most felt that much homework remained to be done before constituent assembly polls are held and democracy institutionalized. [Passage omitted: calls on goverement to stop Maoist intimidation and like activities] party President Sher Bahadur Deuba and ministers representing the party in the government were also present. The central members and MPs urged the central committee to state whether the party should espouse democratic republic or ceremonial king.

Priorities differ according to the economic backgrounds and approaches to life.
Chandra Tamang, 15, lost his mother when he was born and was abandoned by his father, being accused of ""a cursed child who swallowed his mother.""
Chandra worked in a carpet factory in Kathmandu till the age of eight, until he was no longer required as his fingers were no longer nimble enough to weave carpets.
He then started to clean dishes at a coffee shop till the age of 13. But ""I love to sing and want to teach music to people similar as me,"" dreams Chandra.
Upendra Sahani, 13, along with his four brothers, had been left in Kathmandu by his own father.
""I love listening to music and taking pictures from my brother's mobile phone,"" says Upendra. They live in a small shack located in the slums of Jadibuti at Koteshwor.
All the brothers have skin disease known as scabies. They were involved in gambling and theft in the Jadibuti slum area. He adds, ""I have many friends in my village and I miss them. I want to go back and rejoin them.""
""I love to eat Cadbury and dance,"" says Maria, 9, who lost her mother who had been suffering from an incurable skin disease, and she has the same. She was abandoned by her father for being a girl child. She is now being raised by her aunt.
Krishna Mani Baral, 21, came to Kathmandu while he was in the 7th grade. He is currently pursuing BBA in the second year and working at a school to support himself and two younger brothers back in his village.
""I want to make money just enough to meet my basic needs and not own a car. I want to support underprivileged children,"" he says.
In is here where comes Koseli, a non-government and not-for-profit school under the NGO Shikshantar, located in Sina Mangal to the east of Kathmandu City. Koseli has been providing food, education and partial shelter to Chandra, Upendra, Maria, and Krishna along with 100 other children facing similar plights.
""Our goal is to integrate these children in the mainstream of society through education. We want to make them independent to the extent that they can have a decent family life outside the slums,"" affirmed Renu Shah Bagaria, founder and Principal of Koseli. ""
There are many children seeking admission but we don't have enough resources to absorb them due to financial crunch. Our school runs on voluntary contributions by samaritans.
The conditions of the slums that these kids lived in were pathetic to the extent that most of them suffer from mild to severe skin diseases and ulcers. However, these children were adapted to such conditions.
Now, Koseli has been a better shelter for them since they are given bath, clothes, foods, education and a playground.
Chandra has been admitted to a music institute and the diseases of Upendra and Maria are now under control since they have been provided hygienic conditions and medications. Krishna teaches at Koseli itself to meet his financial necessities. Most of the teachers at Koseli are similar to Krishna in terms of economical background and education. They pay their college fees with the salary they receive at Koseli.
To show how far the rehabilitated children have come so far, and to install drinking a water system at Koseli, the children enacted a wonderful satirical-tragic drama titled ""Jamunko Rukh"" at Gurukul on September 24, in which the protagonist dies to the indifference of the society and the state's political and bureaucratic mess.
Noteworthy establishments such as Koseli can be found in and around the Kathmandu Valley while the Valley itself acts as a barrier to the nation's progress.
The presence of such institutes, therefore, also indicates a rise in the number of destitute children created by the Valley's cities.
The root cause for this is illiteracy, unemployment and poverty which the state should focus on but it is Koseli and other likeminded NGOs are meeting the state's duties and obligations in this particular sector.

Donald Camp, U.S. deputy assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, said he regretted the decision banning him from seeing Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal, who has been under house arrest since last month.
The government did not provide a reason for denying the meeting, Camp told reporters in the capital, Katmandu.
Camp began his visit Wednesday by meeting with King Gyanendra at his vacation palace in Pokhara, a resort town in west Nepal.
Camp reiterated U.S. President George W. Bush's stance that said ""the king should reach out to the political parties to restore democratic institutions,"" he told a news conference Thursday.
""We firmly believe that the Maoists must abandon violence and the king must reach out and reconcile with the parties if we are to see a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Nepal,"" Camp said.
The United States has been pressuring the king to initiate dialogue with political parties amid protests against his authoritarian rule.
The monarch seized control of the government on Feb. 1, 2005, a move he said was needed to quell a bloody communist rebellion and bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene.
The country's major political parties have since demanded the restoration of democracy, but the monarch has ceded little ground, instead cracking down on protests and opposition politicians.
His refusal to compromise has also sparked an unlikely alliance between the rebels and an alliance of seven major political parties who have vowed to oust Gyanendra.
Camp said the United States has no immediate plan to resume military assistance suspended since the king's power grab.
He also met with several other political leaders and the army chief Pyar Jung Thapa during his visit to the Himalayan nation.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have fought for a decade to establish a communist Nepal. The insurgency has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.

Text of report by Deepesh Das Shrestha entitled: ""US 'misguided' on parties-Maoists relationship, say leaders""; published by Nepalese Kantipuronline.com website on 5 November
Kathmandu, 5 November: Leaders of the seven mainstream political parties Saturday [5 November] said they were taken aback by the US embassy's statement which expressed alarm over a possible alliance between the parties and Maoists. Nevertheless the leaders took the remarks on a positive note.
""We have never declared forging an alliance with the Maoists and we never will,"" said Krishna Prasad Sitaula, spokesman of the Nepali Congress. ""I think the US is confused about our relationship with the Maoists."" Sitaula said that to resolve the ongoing conflict and to end the ""autocratic regime"", talks are compulsory with the Maoists.
Sitaula was reacting to a statement issued by the US embassy in Kathmandu on Friday. The US had reminded the parties of their promise that they would not enter into any formal relationship with the Maoists, unless and until the latter firmly renounce violence, put their weapons down and commit to supporting the democratic process.
Stating that the Maoists have done nothing to indicate that they are prepared to abandon violence in the long-term despite their truce offer, the US also suggested that the best way to restore democracy and prevent the Maoist takeover is through unity between Nepal's legitimate political forces and the monarchy.
But Sitaula said that the root cause of the political instability was the king, as his political ambition to hoard power by sidelining the parties was increasing day by day. ""There is no atmosphere of holding talks with the king at present,"" said Sitaula.
CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)] Spokesman Pradeep Nepal opined that the US remark was made in ""haste without understanding the facts"".
""I think the US misunderstood us (seven parties),"" said Nepal. ""We are just for talks and not for an alliance with the Maoists."" Nepal said that the statement grabbed his party's attention but added, ""We have not taken it seriously.""
The US statement comes at a time when the gap between the political parties and the king has further widened after the 1 February move. As the royal government has been bypassing the political parties, the seven-party alliance meeting in mid-October decided to give the responsibility of holding talks with the Maoists to the parties' top leaders to bail out the country from the ongoing political impasse.
Meanwhile, the seven-party alliance has announced to boycott the municipal and parliamentary elections scheduled for 8 February [2006] and mid-April 2007 respectively and have threatened to intensify their protests.
Speculations are high that CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, who is currently in New Delhi, would meet Maoist leaders during his stay there. UML's No 2 leader, K.P. Sharma Oli, in New Delhi had hinted at the possibility of a meeting with the Maoists. ""If they (Maoists) decide to contact us and discuss ideas, I am for dialogue,"" Oli said a few weeks ago.
Back in Kathmandu, UML's influential leader Bam Dev Gautam revealed that a meeting took place with the Maoist politburo members during his visit to the remote Rolpa district in mid-western Nepal two weeks ago.
While calling the embassy's suggestions positive, Acting President of the Nepali Congress-Democratic Gopal Man Shrestha said, ""It is surprising to see the statement, as we have never decided forming an alliance with the Maoists,"" but added, ""Given the current political situation and the king's belligerence, we are closer to the Maoists in order to restore democracy in the nation.""

    According to the sources, Ram Prabesh Shah Kanu, a CPN-M cadre, was kidnapped from Rautahat District, some 110 km south of  Kathmandu, and then shot dead by the armed activists of  Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) (Terai Democratic Liberation Front in English) led by Jwala Singh.
    The JTMM's Military Commander Abhay Singh took responsibility  for Kanu's killing.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese Kantipur Television on 18 August
 The citizens of Kathmandu are in confusion and in a state of panic following an indefinite embargo on the capital, called by the Maoists. There has also been anger that people will not be able to leave or enter the capital due to the embargo. However, due to fears of retribution by the Maoists, few people are willing to express their opinion and anger publicly.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13:15 GMT, 18 Aug 04
There was confusion among passengers at exit points and bus terminals in the capital since early this morning as ticket counters were shut and there was no movement of long-distance buses. Only eight buses and six private cars risked the embargo and left the capital today. However, in the afternoon, some 25 vehicles which left the capital were escorted by the army up to 26 km away from the capital. Army sources say, security will be provided in a similar manner for vehicles leaving and entering the capital. However, passengers and bus operators have their doubts about their safety despite the army's assurances. On a routine day anything between 900 and 1,000 vehicles come and go through the Thankot point in the capital. The embargo has not only affected vehicle movement in and out of Kathmandu but has also brought transport to a halt in Nuwakot, Tanahu and Rasuwa and other surrounding areas adjoining the capital.
 Meanwhile, leaders of the ruling parties in government say the embargo on the capital could be a strategic move by the Maoists to pressure the government into peace talks. Talking to Kantipur Television today, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Bam Dev Gautam said the embargo was going to have a direct effect on the common people but, he said, the doors for peace talks would not be closed due to the Maoists embargo. [passage omitted: repetition of Guatam's remarks]
 Likewise, the leader of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), Narayan Khadka, said, with the Maoist call for an indefinite embargo on the capital, the government must now be serious on holding peace talks.

"5508",20066651,"Title: Everest Remains Deadly Draw for Climbers.rtf; Date: July 15, 2006 Saturday 8:41 PM GMT; Text: Sipping black tea on a glacial beach of jagged gray rocks nearly four miles above sea level, the lanky Briton had the air of a jilted lover who didn't want to admit it was over.
Twice before, David Sharp had stood on this gravel plain in Mount Everest's shadow. In 2003 and again in 2004, the 34-year-old engineer had made it well into the ""Death Zone"" above 26,000 feet before weather, frostbite and lack of oxygen had forced him to turn around, just out of sight of the summit.
Already, the quest had cost Sharp parts of two toes.
Now, warmed by a hissing propane heater in a mess tent at a camp below Everest's forbidding North Face, the bespectacled Briton was telling camp neighbor Dave Watson that his courtship of the mountain was drawing to a close.
Sharp was preparing to begin a new career as a teacher in the fall, and he told the Vermonter that it was time to move on.
""I don't really have the money to come back here anymore,"" said Sharp, bathed in ghostly blue light filtering through the tent's nylon walls. ""So if I don't do it this time, I'm not coming back.""
But Sharp didn't believe he'd need to come back. He was sure this third assault would succeed.
He blamed his frostbite on cheap equipment, and believed he'd remedied that. He'd had none of the headaches, diarrhea, coughs or sinus infections that plagued so many at this altitude. He was looking and climbing strong and was determined, to a fault.
""I would give up more toes or even fingers to get on top,"" he told Watson, who was troubled by the comment.
In the summit-at-all-cost world of Mount Everest, both men knew the price can be much higher.
The Nepalese call it Sagarmatha, ""goddess of the sky."" To Tibetans, it is Qomolungma, ""goddess, mother of the world."" The British named it Everest, after the head of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Many climbers refer to the mountain simply as ""the hill.""
Since 1852, when a surveyor's calculations confirmed ""Peak XV"" as the world's tallest, it has claimed more than 200 lives. Many, like British schoolmaster George Leigh Mallory, who famously declared that he climbed Everest ""because it's there,"" remain on the mountain frozen reminders that this most hostile of environments was not designed to support life.
It wasn't until 1953, 29 years after Mallory died on his third expedition to Everest, that New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached the summit more than 29,000 feet up. Tales of the feats that earned Hillary a knighthood were like food for generations of British schoolchildren children like David Sharp.
Growing up in the North Yorkshire market town of Guisborough, the nearest thing to a mountain Sharp had to look up to was the colorfully named, 1,050-foot Roseberry Topping. His passion for climbing blossomed after he entered Nottingham University to pursue an engineering degree, and joined the university's mountaineering club.
Before long, Sharp had bagged his first major peak, the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps. Other, higher mountains followed: Mount Elbrus, Europe's tallest; Africa's Kilimanjaro; Pakistan's Gasherbrum.
Sharp took time off from his job to backpack through South America and Southeast Asia. In 2002, he joined an Irish expedition for his biggest trial yet Tibet's Cho Oyu, at 26,906 feet the world's sixth-highest peak.
Expedition leader Richard Dougan was amazed at how quickly Sharp acclimated to the thin air. At 5-foot-11 and barely 150 pounds, the sinewy Englishman had no body fat to spare and moved fast to keep warm.
Sharp was clearly a gifted rock climber, free-climbing a particularly tricky rock cliff rather than rely on iffy ropes. Dougan considered him ""definitely the strongest member of our team.""
He was a convivial camp companion, who would laugh as other climbers tried to eat their frozen chocolate bars, then pull out his stash of fudge, which remained supple even at high altitudes. He enjoyed his whiskey and beer.
After Sharp made it to the top of Cho Oyu with relative ease, Dougan invited him to join a 2003 expedition to Everest.
They would be climbing the North to Northeast Ridge route the one blazed at such great cost by Mallory.
In the high camps, Mallory entertained his team by reading aloud from ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear."" Nearly 79 years later, Sharp carried a volume of Shakespeare in his battered rucksack while making his first assault on Everest.
Most climbers begin their final ascent in the middle of the night so they arrive at the summit in the early to late morning. This allows maximum daylight hours for making the tricky descent and, not incidentally, for victory photographs.
At around midnight on May 22, 2003, Sharp and Dougan left the 27,231-foot Camp 3 to begin their summit push. Clipping onto a fixed rope by metal jumars, locking ascending devices attached to their safety harnesses, they trudged upward, their boots' spiked crampons biting into the rock and ice.

"5748",20073405,"Title: Nepal paper accuses Home Ministry of _sheer negligence_ after blasts.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: September 4, 2007 Tuesday
Text of editorial carried by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 4 September
Even the day after the serial blasts in the capital, the Home Ministry has not yet called a press conference to disclose the facts surrounding the incident. Nothing has been forthcoming to identify those who carried out this inhumane and unpardonable violence and take action against them. Neither the Home Ministry nor the police has called a press conference to inform the public.
The Home Ministry, by condemning the violence and making public the list of the deceased and injured, thinks that it has fulfilled its responsibility, but such conduct by the home administration will give rise to doubts among the masses about any action taken against those involved in terrorist activities.
Similarly, it is a lack of a sense of responsibility towards ensuring the flow of information, the government has done nothing to allay fears of terrorism among the general public or in any way addressed the need to reassure the masses.
It was only a day after the incident that an emergency cabinet meeting was held denouncing terrorism and expressing determination to act. Similarly, Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula described the explosions as a terrorist act and informed a parliamentary committee that the facts would be made public after investigations. Briefing parliament's Constituent Assembly Elections Management and Monitoring Special Committee, he said the government ""is into serious investigations"" and ""stern action would be taken"" against those involved. Nothing has been made clear regarding how and through which body the investigations would be carried out.
Even in the face of such a horrific incident, no special committee has been formed to carry out investigations and hunt down those responsible and no body has been given any special responsibility. This is another example of sheer negligence.
During the Maoist conflict in the country prior to this, thousands of people lost their lives, but there never was a series of explosions targeting ordinary people in such a fashion. It is apparent that the aim of the incident was clearly to create terror through killing people and disturbing the atmosphere for the constituent assembly elections. That is why an atmosphere of terror will not go away and confidence in the elections will not rise until genuine investigations are carried out and the guilty are actually punished.
The government and in particular the Home Ministry have an important responsibility to step up the investigations in a credible fashion, keeping the people informed about the investigations and making them feel reassured about the state of security in the country. Otherwise, groups that are ready to resort to terror to realize their objectives can always keep up such heinous activities in some form or other. This is an assault on the intelligence not just of the Home Ministry, the government and the eight-party coalition, but of all thinking Nepalese citizens. And in order to counter this, the political parties should team up and ask the government to carry out adequate investigations and reassure the people about their security.

Former King Gyanendra says he wants to stay to ""help establish peace"" as the country moves from a monarchy to a republic.
Hundreds of people came to see Gyanendra leave Katmandu's royal palace Wednesday night. His departure marks the end of the final chapter of the world's last Hindu monarchy.
Nepal was declared a republic last month after elections that saw the country's former communist rebels win the most seats in a special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) Nepal's deposed king made final arrangements to vacate Katmandu's main palace Wednesday and begin life as a civilian in the newly declared republic, saying he had no plans to leave the country.
Ousted King Gyanendra said he handed in his royal scepter and crown of peacock feathers, yak hair and jewels to the Nepali government Wednesday as he prepared to move to one of his former summer palaces on a forested hill on the outskirts of Katmandu.
There, he will be protected by police but will otherwise live as any other Nepali albeit an incredibly wealthy one who some believe should still reign.
""I have no intention or thoughts to leave the country,"" Gyanendra said in his first public statement in months. ""I will stay in the country to help establish peace.""
The vast majority of Nepalis have made it clear they are pleased to see the monarchy no more, and while Gyanendra's throne was formally abolished last month, Wednesday's move carries great symbolism in a nation that was ruled by Shah dynasty monarchs for 239 years.
""This marks the beginning of a new Nepal and the end of a dynasty that has done nothing but harm this country,"" said Devendra Maharjan, a farmer who came to Katmandu to see the king leave the palace. ""If it had not been for the kings, Nepal would probably not have remained a poor nation.""
Nepal was declared a republic last month after elections that saw the country's former communist rebels win the most seats in a special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution.
""I have accepted the decision,"" Gyanendra told reporters.
Speaking in a grand palace hall decorated with portraits of the Shah dynasty kings, stuffed tigers and ornate chandeliers, he said: ""I have done all I can to cooperate with (the government's) directives.""
The Narayanhiti palace has been Gyanendra's home since becoming king in 2001, after a palace massacre in which a gunman, allegedly the crown prince, assassinated King Birendra and much of the royal family before killing himself.
Government officials plan to turn the pink concrete 1970s palace into a museum.
After his brother's death, Gyanendra assumed the throne. But the killings helped pierce the mystique surrounding a line of kings who had once been revered as reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu.
No proof has ever surfaced that Gyanendra was involved in the massacre, but rumors have swirled for years that he was behind the slaughter.
On Wednesday, he dismissed the accusations as a baseless ""campaign to defame the royal institution.""
In 2005, Gyanendra seized power from a civilian government, a move that made him deeply unpopular. He said he needed total authority to crush the communist insurgency. But the rebellion intensified, and a year later massive protests forced Gyanendra to restore democracy, after which the rebels began peace talks.
The king does not leave public life a pauper, even if his palaces have been nationalized and his $3.1 million annual allowance cut.
Before assuming the throne, he was known as a tough businessman with interests in tourism, tea and tobacco. He also inherited much of his family's wealth after the palace massacre.
The government is letting Gyanendra live in the summer palace which was among the royal residences that were nationalized because the former king's son is living in the family's private Katmandu residence.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 8 November, by Akhilesh Tripathi and Suresh Nath Neupane
Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 8 November: The ruling seven-party alliance [SPA] and the Maoist rebels have finally reached a historic agreement putting an end to the decade-long armed insurgency. The different rounds of informal meetings and ""summit meets"" held between the two sides since May, after the collapse of the autocratic royal regime, have finally resulted in agreements on all political and arms issues, paving way for the Maoist rebels to join the political mainstream.
The groundbreaking agreement comprising six major points was reached after 21 hours of rigorous discussions between the two sides during the fifth round of summit talks that took place on Monday and Tuesday at the prime minister's residence at Baluwatar.
The historic agreement was signed by the top leaders of all the eight parties and made public on Tuesday night (8 November, 1 a.m.).
As per the agreement, an interim legislature and interim government including the Maoists will be formed by 26 November and 1 December 2006 respectively.
The total number of lawmakers in the interim legislature will be 330, with the Nepali Congress (NC), CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)], Nepali Congress-Democratic (NC-D), Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), People's Front Nepal (PFN), Nepal Majdoor and Kisan Party (NMKP) and Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP) retaining the number of seats they have in the existing parliament in the interim legislature also.
Including upper house, the NC, UML, NC-D, RPP, PFN and NMKP have 75, 73, eight, five, one and five seats respectively.
The Maoists will have 73 berths in the interim legislature. The remaining 48 seats will be divided among the SPA [seven-party alliance], Maoists, other fringe parties and the civil society.
The two sides have also agreed to promulgate the interim constitution by 21 November. The king will have no constitutional right in the interim constitution.
An interim government including the Maoists will be in place by 1 December after the two sides sign a comprehensive peace agreement by 16 November. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will lead the interim government.
The task of separating the Maoist combatants from their arms will be completed by 24 November. The Maoist combatants will be kept in ""seven divisions and 21 brigades"" and their arms will be locked up in storages. Electronic devices will be installed in the storages any human movement in the storages will trigger a siren. The monitoring and supervision of the Maoist arms will be done by the UN.
The cantonments will be located in Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam [i.e. districts across Nepal].
The two sides also agreed to decide the fate of the monarchy through the first sitting of the constituent assembly. The UML, which has been insisting on deciding the issue of monarchy through a referendum, however, registered ""note of dissent"" on the agreement on monarchy.
The two sides have also agreed on a mixed electoral system (proportional and geographical) for the constituent assembly elections, with the UML again tabling a note of dissent on this issue as well. The UML had been pressing for a proportional system for the CA elections.
All Nepalis above 18 years of age will be eligible to cast their votes in the CA elections, which will be held by mid-June 2007.

The withdrawal came before a planned vote in the 329-member interim legislature.
The Maoists, who have only 84 seats in the parliament, were certain to lose.
""We have withdrawn the proposal in the interest of unity among the seven party alliance,"" Krishna Bahadur Mahara, the Maoist leader in parliament, said.
The rebels had called a special session of the interim legislature to push the proposal, saying King Gyanendra would not allow an election of a constituent assembly to take place.
""We tried to forge consensus among the seven parties on our proposal, but failed,"" said Mahara, who is also spokesman for the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
Replying to questions raised during the debate on the Maoist proposal, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said Nepal is well on its way to becoming a republic and that unity among the seven political parties, including the Maoists, should not be undermined.
Koirala's Nepali Congress Party, which holds 132 seats in the legislature, was the principal opponent of the Maoist proposal for setting up a republic quickly.
Nepal is to hold an election for a constituent assembly as a cornerstone of its two-year-old peace process, but the election, which is to rewrite the constitution, has been twice-postponed, the last time on Oct. 5.
No new date for the election has been set.
In earlier agreements with the mainstream Nepalese political parties, the Maoists had agreed to let a constituent assembly decide the fate of monarchy.

Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
New Delhi, 23 January: A proposal to exempt certain categories of people from visa requirement for travel within South Asia is expected to be one of the main issues along with initiatives to forge greater integration and end terror in the region at the upcoming Saarc meet in Thimphu.
The SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] foreign ministers' meeting in Thimphu on 8 February is also expected to take stock of various other initiatives, including economic integration, utilisation of the SAARC Development Fund and the Food Bank and formation of the South Asian Forum.
The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme is expected to be one of the major issues on the agenda of the meeting which will be attended by external affairs minister SM Krishna and his counterparts from other seven member nations, sources said here.
There has been a proposal for expanding the list of people from various fields of life to be exempted from visa requirement for travel within eight SAARC member countries.
At present MPs, judges, 100 identified business leaders, sportspersons and 150 journalists are availing SAARC visa facility.
Seeking a modification in the scheme, India wants that the prior approval should be accorded to the three categories, business persons, sportspersons and journalists. Once the prior approval is taken, they may be given special stickers with longterm multi-entry provision, sources said, adding that the idea was to improve the system so that it can be implemented effectively without any fear of misuse.
The SAARC Council of Ministers' meeting is also expected to discuss the progress made in the implementation of regional Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). The MLAT was agreed upon at the Saarc Summit in Colombo in 2008. Since then, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives have ratified it but Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal are yet to do so, the sources said.
The SAARC countries, at the home minister's conference in Islamabad in June last year, had also agreed to step up cooperation in fight against terror and consider a proposal to form a SAARC Police force (SAARCPOL) on the pattern of Interpol.

The bus was traveling near the town of Tribeni, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of the Nepalese capital, Katmandu, when it skidded off the road, plunging about 250 meters (950 feet) into a ravine bellow, said local police officer Birkha Bahadur Rawal.
Police are investigating the cause, he said adding that an initial probe indicated the driver may have lost control of the vehicle because it was overloaded with passengers.
Police did not yet know if the driver was among those who survived.
The bus was traveling toward the southern town of Dang when the accident occurred.
Among those killed, 32 died on the spot while eight died on the way to the hospital, Rawal said. Another two died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Dang.
About a dozen more were in a critical condition and hospitalized at Nepalgunj, he said.
Police official Rawal said some of the passengers managed to jump and survived, indicating there were several people traveling on the roof, a common practice in rural Nepal where not much public transportation is available.
A bus ticket attendant who survived the crash, Jeevan Nepali, Told the Associated Press by mobile phone from his hospital bed that the bus was unable to pick up speed on the slopes and the driver stopped. It then rolled backward and off the road.
He said he and some of the passengers managed to jump off.
Deadly road accidents are common in Nepal, often caused by poor roads and aging overcrowded vehicles.

Businesses, schools and shops are closed, and roads are quiet throughout the country.
The government has vowed to foil the strike, saying that the political parties are staging protests merely to help warring Maoist rebels to topple it.
The government has also deployed extra security forces, citing the likelihood of violence in major cities including Kathmandu.
The seven parties including the Nepali Congress Party and the Marxist-Leninist Party say that the general strike is a peaceful protest aimed at forcing the Nepalese monarch to hand over power to the people.
King Gyanendra seized executive powers in February last year in what he says is his bid to stem the Himalayan nation's decade-old communist insurgency.
The parties, however, allege that he has usurped the people's power and gone back to the autocracy of the old days which is unacceptable to the Nepalese people.
The king has clearly failed to put a halt to the insurgency-triggered violence, they contend.
For his part, the monarch has ignored calls for reaching out to the political parties to best tackle the insurgency that has caused more than 13,000 deaths since its outbreak in 1996.

 Ghartigaon (Rolpa) mid west Nepal , 16 May: Security forces mobilised against the Maoists have taken control of most of the areas of Rolpa, the home district of Maoist military commander Nanada Kishore Pun, (alias Pasang) and surrounding Maoists positions. The troops, led by Lt-Col Shumsher Thakuri, have been conducting operations for the past twenty days and are in control of Rangsi village of Pasang as well as other Maoist base areas.
 Maoists vacated the areas after hundreds of soldiers armed with long range weapons set up base camp on hills overlooking Ghartigaon. After being unable to face the army, the Maoists have instead started destroying water tanks and attempted to cut off supply lines to the soldiers. The Maoists have also fired on soldiers stationed at Ghartigaon from tall surrounding mountains in Rangsi and Bhawang Village Development Committee (VDC). Although there have been few skirmishes, all out fighting has not yet erupted.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 17 May 04, p1
The Maoists are only showing their presence at night when soldiers return to their barracks after patrol. Lt-Col Thakuri told Kantipur: ""The Maoists suffered heavy casualties in Myagdi west Nepal that is why their presence appears to be weak here.
 Some of the soldiers on Saturday 15 May were moved to different locations. Apart from Ghartigaon, the soldiers are also stationed in Gam and Gajul areas. However, few people are feeling secure with the operations. People here say they are more worried about the dangers after the security operations. Chandra Bahadur Oli of Ghartigaon, located at a day's walk from district headquarters, says 'If the army is to come here and stay here, they should do that on a permanent basis.""
 Oli told army officials, including chief of army's western division headquarters chief, Maj-Gen Rupmangat Katuwal: ""We do not know what our conditions will be once the army withdraws from the area."" The soldiers are also conducting humanitarian services including mobile health camps in Rolpa and Rukum districts both in mid west Nepal .

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 16 February
Kathmandu, 16 February: The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed deep concern over the resumption of full-scale armed conflict in Nepal after the end of Maoist announced four-month long cease-fire on 2 January. ""It is a tragedy for the people of Nepal that full-scale conflict has now resumed,"" said Ian Martin at a press meet in Kathmandu while making public the commission's report on the rights situation in the country. Martin said that the cease-fire was a significant factor in the ""marked reduction in killings of all kinds,"" although other violations by the CPN (Maoist) continued, including abductions, threats and extortion, as did violations by security forces.
Welcoming the release of some persons made captives by the Maoists, Martin in a statement urged the Maoist leadership to respect human rights.  ""The leadership of the CPN (Maoist) has made further commitments to us and to others that they will observe international humanitarian law and respect human rights, but they have to ensure that their cadres respect these in practice,"" the statement said.  Martin also said that there was a significant decline in disappearances reported in 2005 but added, ""... [ellipsis as published] I must stress as strongly as I can the continuing responsibility of the state to clarify the many outstanding cases of disappearances from previous years.""
Martin also expressed concern over the recent clashes between the rebels and the security forces in densely populated areas and said her office would continue closely monitoring such incidents. ""Our investigations into clashes in Kichnas (Syangja District), Tansen (Palpa District), Phaparbari (Makwanpur District) and Panauti (Kabrepalanchok District) found that each of the clashes occurred in highly populated areas, placing the civilian population in grave danger, and combatants made use of civilian buildings, including schools,"" the statement said. ""This violates the requirements of international humanitarian law to protect civilians against the dangers arising from military operations,"" the UN body said.
On being asked how the UN commission was coordinating with the security forces, Martin said that the response from the Royal Nepalese Army on human rights abuse cases has not been satisfactory. ""We are having regular communication with the RNA human rights cell. They have responded to us in a number of cases but not to our full satisfaction,"" the UN country representative said. ""The reduction in the number of detainees in army barracks and of disappearances, and the commitments to establish a central register of detainees and to legislate against torture, are positive developments, but transparent investigations, prosecutions and appropriate punishment to end the impunity of perpetrators are essential,"" said Martin.
Martin said it was frustrating as no details were provided about the RNA's military court's investigation process. Touching the issues of democratic rights, the UN body said that she ""continued to be concerned about restrictions or attempted restrictions on fundamental rights: on freedom of expression, through the Media Ordinance; on freedom of association, through the Code of Conduct imposed on non-governmental organizations; and on freedom of peaceful assembly"".
""The great majority of detainees have been arbitrarily arrested for exercising their right to freedom of assembly or expressing their political opinion,"" Martin said. ""In every case brought before the courts, their detention is being found illegal, and the authorities should not be waiting for court orders before releasing all those against whom there is no evidence of involvement in violence,"" added Martin.
Martin said that the commission has found excessive use of force by police while monitoring a large number of demonstrations and said that her office is investigating the circumstances of the incident where a demonstrator died when the RNA fired on demonstrators in Ghorahi of Dang district on 8 February. ""We do not believe that investigations are being undertaken with the seriousness and independence that is required,"" Martin said.
Condemning the murder of two election candidates, attacks on other candidates and the murder of a taxi driver during Maoist called strike; Martin called on the Maoist leadership for the results of investigations to be made public and action taken against those responsible. The report which highlights the violations by state authorities and by the rebels in the context of armed conflict, issues of respect for democratic rights and some longer-standing human rights issues will be presented to the 62nd session of the Commission on Human Rights, scheduled to be held from 13 March to 21 April.

 Nepalgunj, 24 June: Rebel Maoists have captured a leased micro-hydro project in Rukum District after its management committee refused to provide them a sum of 100,000 rupees as donation.
 The Bafikot-based Syarpu Daha two-kW micro-hydro project supplies electricity to villages in Shobha, Bafikot and Pokhara village development committees VDC .
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 25 Jun 03Managing director of the project, Prem Prakash Oli, said that the rebels are also collecting electricity tariff from the consumers in the VDCs. The Nepal Electricity Authority had leased the project to a private party for a 10-year period.
 ""The rebels had first demanded 200,000 rupees and stuck to 100,000 rupees later. They have been collecting tariff from 300 consumers for the last seven months, after we refused to meet their demand,"" Oli said.
 The project used to collect 52,000 rupees as revenue from its consumers every month. He said that they would not be able to carry out regular maintenance of the project after the rebels resorted to such a tactic.
 Electrification process in other parts of the district has also been suspended due to the Maoist obstruction, he said. Of the total 43 VDCs of the district, only five have access to electricity, as the district has not been connected with the national grid. He said that they would not be able to operate the project in future without adequate security arrangement.

""Our party cadres will not be involved in any activity that creates unrest in the alliance's peaceful demonstration,"" Maoist leader Prachanda said.
In the wake of deadly Maoist attacks near Kathmandu over the weekend, the government has imposed a late-night curfew in the capital and banned all public meetings and protests.
The curfew was extended Wednesday by two hours from 9pm until 4am,  state-run media reported.
Organizers from seven opposition parties ousted by King Gyanendra nearly a year ago have said that they will defy the ban and go ahead with the planned mass protest on Friday.
The government has said the ban is necessary to preserve public order and urged people not to attend the rally, warning that there could be violence.
""Our party wants to appeal to the public of Kathmandu and the whole nation to come out onto the streets for the demonstration to show people's power by defying the ban imposed by the feudalistic regime,"" said Prachanda, whose name means ""the fierce one.""
More than 12,000 people have died since the Maoists declared their ""people's war"" nearly a decade ago.
What began as a few dozen fighters armed with home-made guns in 1996 has become a force that effectively controls large swathes of countryside in the impoverished Hindu kingdom sandwiched between India and China.
Last November the opposition parties and the Maoists formed a loose alliance that hinged on the rebels giving up armed struggle and joining the political process.
Despite the killing of at least 45 people since the Maoists ended their four-month unilateral ceasefire earlier this month, the alliance still holds, a rebel leader said in a statement sent Monday.

More than 1,100 people have died across South Asia since the start of the annual monsoon season in mid-June, with the region's rivers bursting their banks due to relentless rains and snows melting in the Himalayas.
Britain and the United Nations have stepped up to assist local authorities, with London pledging 2.5 million dollars in aid and the world body launching emergency relief operations.
Northern and eastern India has borne the brunt of the disaster, with 1,000 people dead and about 14 million villagers in Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states awaiting much-needed aid amid fears that disease could soon spread.
""Whatever baby food I had is now exhausted and there is no alternative other than trying to forcibly feed my daughter boiled rice,"" 27-year-old Rahima Begum, whose home near the Brahmaputra River in Assam is under water, told AFP.
""My son is down with fever and diarrhoea for the last two days,"" said labourer Bhairab Madhab, who like Begum lives in the village of Senimari.
""Getting a doctor is a distant dream with flood waters surrounding us.""
Some 5.5 million people have been displaced in Assam, nearly seven million others are stranded in Bihar state, where 3,000 villages have been inundated, officials said. Another 1.5 million have been displaced in Uttar Pradesh.
""Some of these areas are very far-flung,"" Uttar Pradesh spokesman Shrish Dubey said. Twenty-eight people drowned in the state Wednesday when a boat carrying both aid workers and evacuees splintered apart.
An official in Bihar's hard-hit Darbhanga district said the area had been drenched with 875 millimetres (three feet) of rain in July, more than three times what it received during the entire monsoon season last year.
The Indian capital New Delhi was also battered with rain overnight, receiving 166 millimetres of rain in a 24-hour span, more than half its average for the entire month of August.
In neighbouring Bangladesh, where 54 people have lost their lives, officials said 5.6 million had been displaced or marooned in their homes, with about 160,000 now housed in shelters.
Britain's Department for International Development announced Thursday that it would give 2.5 million dollars to the relief effort for food, water, shelter and medicine for flood victims.
The United Nations has started flying emergency relief operations to assist hundreds of thousands of Nepalis affected by monsoon-triggered floods and landslides, the world body said.
At least 84 people have been killed since the start of the monsoon season, according to Nepal's home ministry.
Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and are at heightened risk of contracting water-borne diseases, Nepal's health ministry warned this week.
Aid organisations have emphasised the need for quick relief efforts, warning the death toll could rise if villagers resort to drinking stagnant flood waters.
""Providing safe drinking water and addressing public health is essential because it saves lives,"" Lalchand Garg, Oxfam's manager in eastern India, said in a statement.
Monsoon rains that sweep the subcontinent from June through September are crucial for farmers and the economy, but also cause massive property damage and hundreds of deaths annually.

 There was a rush in the street as the government eased curfew for eight hours Saturday 4 September , between 5.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. 2315 gmt 3 September - 0715 gmt 4 September , in Kathmandu and Lalitpur to give people time to buy necessaries. During these hours, streets wore a busy look as public transport resumed while shops selling goods of daily use were busier than on normal days.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Sep 04
With indefinite curfews in place since Wednesday afternoon following violent protests in reaction to the killing of 12 Nepali hostages in Iraq, the security situation in Kathmandu has now become quite normal. No violent incidents have been reported since the curfew was imposed. ""The situation seems quite under control. There is no reason why the curfews should be extended,"" maintained Sita G.C., a teacher and a housewife from Kuleshwor who was spotted buying vegetables at Kalimati.""
 ""The government should properly assess the situation now and take the right decision. Protracting curfews is no solution,"" she opined.
 Others also shared similar views. ""The government could not act when mobs were on rampage. Curfew was necessary on that day and may be the following day,"" one Yogesh Khadka, a university student, said adding: ""What vexes me is that there is information from the government side when the curfews are going to be lifted."" On the other hand, the district administrations of Kathmandu and Lalitpur have not given any clue as to when the curfews in their respective areas are going to be lifted.

"4609",20061980,"Title: Protests in Nepal over delay in vote on curtailing royal powers.rtf; Date: May 16, 2006 Tuesday 5:34 AM GMT; Text: About 2,000 people demonstrated in Nepal's capital on Tuesday to protest delays in a parliamentary vote on a proclamation that would strip Nepal's king of his political and military powers.
The protesters burnt tires and chanted slogans against the delay, caused by differences within the Himalayan country's ruling seven-party alliance.
The declaration would remove King Gyanendra's constitutional control over the 90,000-strong Royal Nepalese army and his right to make the final decision on major issues, and hand those powers to Parliament, said Ramesh Lekhak, a legislator for the Nepali Congress Democratic party.
It also would make Gyanendra pay taxes, remove his immunity from prosecution and let Parliament set the royal family's income from the government.
Parliament's speaker, Subash Nemwang, said Monday that the proclamation was likely to be adopted since it was prepared by the alliance, to which a majority of lawmakers belong.
The alliance's majority would allow it to override powers set for the king in the constitution. Gyanendra, who gave up power last month after weeks of popular protests, was not expected to resist.
Voting on the proclamation most likely will take place Thursday, said Lilamani Pokhrel, a legislator with People's Front Nepal, an alliance member.
""The voting was delayed because of some minor differences among the member parties on the issues covered by the proposal,"" he said.
Pokhrel and other legislators would not say what the differences were. Dilendra Badhu of the Nepali Congress party, among the drafters of the proclamation, said all the parties agreed that a full Cabinet should present the proclamation in Parliament for a vote.
Pokhrel said Thursday's vote most likely would take place after an expansion of the Cabinet, which currently has only seven members.
The three main partners in the alliance Nepali Congress, Nepali Congress Democratic and Communist Party of Nepal were all locked in internal meetings Tuesday to decide who they would nominate as ministers. The Cabinet is expected to add 14 new members.
A draft of the proclamation seen by The Associated Press also proposes scrapping the Raj Parishad, the king's advisory council, which contains more than 100 of his supporters and was blamed for advising Gyanendra to seize absolute power last year.
Gyanendra fired the prime minister in February 2005, citing a need to clamp down on corruption and stamp out a communist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people in the past decade.
""There will be major political changes once this proclamation is adopted. The entire executive powers will be with the government, and it will be accountable to Parliament and not the king as in the past,"" Lekhak said.
Weeks of often violent street protests last month forced Gyanendra to give up direct control of the government, reinstate Parliament and return political authority to elected officials.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court was to hear a petition Tuesday by two former ministers under detention who have challenged their arrest.
Sirish Sumshere Rana and Ramesh Nath Pandey, who served under King Gyanendra's government, filed the petition after their arrest last week.

"2868",20045074,"Title: Arabs Decry Militants' Demand to French.rtf; Date: August 31, 2004 Tuesday; Text: The militant demand that a French ban on Islamic head scarves be overturned has raised an unprecedented backlash among religious and political leaders in the Middle East, who have often been silent about hostage slayings and other terrorism.
They say those holding two French journalists have desecrated Islam and mindlessly struck out at a country considered a friend to Arabs.
""This is a brutal operation on the human level, a bad one on the Islamic level and a losing one on the political level,"" Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon's most senior Shiite Muslim cleric, told The Associated Press Tuesday.
Instead of attracting supporters, the kidnappings and their link to the head scarf ban ""provokes the ire of Muslim scholars and intellectuals worldwide,"" Fadlallah said.
Such comments contrasted with muted reaction in the region Tuesday when a grisly video surfaced on a militant Muslim Web site showing the purported killing of 12 Nepalese workers kidnapped in Iraq. The group that claimed responsibility had accused the Nepalese of working for the U.S. military. One Iraqi cleric told Al-Arabiya TV that their deaths, while regrettable, were understandable because ""their work is military work.""
Journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot disappeared Aug. 19 on their way from the Iraqi capital to the southern city of Najaf. A group calling itself ""The Islam Army in Iraq"" claims to be holding the two and has demanded France abolish its ban on Muslim head scarves in public schools.
France has said it would press ahead with the law, which goes into effect when school resumes later this week.
A militant group with a similar name to the one claiming to hold the Frenchmen was believed to have killed an Italian freelance journalist last week after Italy's government rejected a demand that it withdraw its 3,000 soldiers in Iraq.
Unlike Italy, France has no troops in Iraq and gained points with Arabs for leading the opposition to last year's U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. There are fewer than 100 French citizens in Iraq, mostly journalists, aid workers and employees of private companies; nearly all are in Baghdad, according to the French government.
In a video broadcast Saturday, the group holding the two reporters gave the French government 48 hours to drop the head scarf ban, then Al-Jazeera reported Monday that the group had extended its deadline by 24 hours. On Tuesday, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said his group had been told the deadline was Wednesday night.
Zaki said the Arab League was ""using whatever moral influence"" it could to get the men freed, but he said the Arab League was not part of any direct negotiations.
Criticism of the kidnapping has come from government officials, activists and religious figures - including those who have censured France for its head scarf ban.
Syria's Grand Mufti Ahmad Kuftaro issued a statement Tuesday calling for the release of the two reporters and also urging France to reconsider its scarf ban - ""because of the sensitivity and importance of this issue for Muslims."" Kuftaro also praised France's stand in support of Arabs. Many Arabs see France as an important ally in the Arab-Palestinian conflict.
Al-Jazeera, the Arab television station, broadcast a stream of criticism from voices including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Lebanon's most senior Shiite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
In a statement issued by the Palestinian news agency WAFA, Arafat urged the journalists' ""immediate release,"" calling France a friend of the Palestinian cause. Egypt's largest Islamic opposition group, the banned Muslim Brotherhood, also condemned the hostage-taking.
Mohammed Bashar al-Faidi, spokesman for Iraq's Muslim Scholars Association, appealed for the Frenchmen's release during a Baghdad news conference Tuesday, saying while the head scarf ban was ""painful for every Muslim,"" threatening French journalists was no way to solve the problem.
Killing the Frenchmen, he added, could lead to Iraq's international isolation.
Dan Bymen, assistant professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, noted that the focus on a French domestic issue was a change in the militant agenda and does not compare with more pressing issues for Muslims, such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or charges the United States has ""crusader"" intentions for the Middle East.
Still, ""it wasn't shocking to me,"" he said. France has long been a target of Muslim militant movements, especially those with links to Algeria. Also, kidnappers may be aiming to send a message to everyone, including countries that do not feel they are a target, that ""any non-Iraqi in the country or anyone working with the Iraqi government is not wanted,"" he said.
""A successful strategy against an occupation is to make it inhospitable to anyone,"" he said.
The abductions have been condemned worldwide, and with denunciations f"

    Laxmi Mananadhar, conservation officer at the Department of  National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC), told Tuesday's  The Kathmandu Post daily that a 16-year-old female rhino, shot  dead by poachers on May 30, was found in the park on June 2. 
    ""The hooves and horn of the dead rhino are missing,"" he said,  adding that the rhino was shot with a homemade gun. 
    The latest incident comes three months after another rhino was  killed in the park in a similar manner. The park is currently home to 331 one-horned rhinos. 
    According to a census conducted in 2005, there are 372 rhinos  in the CNP. Since then, 41 of them have already perished. Among  the dead, 23 were poached, according to the DNPWC. There are now  only about 2,000 such rhinos in the world. 
    Although 27 out of the 38 security posts set up to protect  wildlife were forced to withdraw during the conflict in the  country, the government re-established 22 of them in the CNP alone over the last one year since the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) joined the political mainstream. 
    The situation is no different at Bardiya National Park in mid- western Nepal, which saw a sharp decline in rhino numbers from 87  to 31 in seven years. 
    Poachers kill the endangered species for the horns, which,  reputed to have aphrodisiac qualities, have a high market value of 20,000-60,000 U.S. dollars per kg in Nepal and abroad, according  to the report.

 Kathmandu: Suspecting that the ban imposed on the Maoists might be in contravention with the constitution, the Supreme Court on Friday 24 September issued a notice to the Office of the Prime Minister and the office of the Council of Ministers asking to justify the ban on the Maoist activities.
 The single bench of Justice Balaram KC has stated that the writ filed at the court has raised various questions regarding the ban on the Maoists and such questions can be a subject for judicial review. The bench has ordered the Office of the Prime Minister and the cabinet to furnish justifications regarding the ban.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 25 Sep 04
The Supreme Court asked the government to clarify its position on this issue by furnishing written replies within 15 days after completing preliminary hearings on the writ. The writ was filed by Taranath Ghimire, a permanent resident of Khartamchha-3 of Bhojpur district east Nepal .
 The writ demands the scrapping of the decision that declared the Maoists as terrorists in August last year in an ""unconstitutional manner"". The writ states that Article 112 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990 has prohibited to put a ban on political parties.
 However, the Supreme Court has clarified that the terrorist tag given to the Maoists cannot be a subject of judicial review. The writ has also sought the immediate removal of the terrorist tag given to the Maoists.
 Similarly, the Supreme Court has made it clear that judicial review does not apply to the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Control and Prevention ordinance. The writ has demanded the scrapping of the ordinance, claiming that it was promulgated against the rights of equality as stated in the Clause 2 and 3 of Article 11 of the constitution.

""The government has made the commitment to immediately begin the process"" of releasing jailed rebels, said Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
Dozens of rebels began the hunger strike on Sunday, demanding that all guerrillas be freed.
The government has released two prominent rebels who were jailed for two years on terrorism charges, but hundreds of other suspected rebels are still in jail.
The new government, installed after King Gyanendra yielded power late last month following weeks of anti-monarchy protests, has given no time frame for freeing those jailed but has said the process is under way.
The rebels have agreed to a government call for peace talks on ending their decade-long insurgency, in which 13,000 people have died. The government also matched the rebels' declaration of a three-month cease-fire, and dropped terrorism charges against the rebels.

Among the dead were a government minister, diplomats and top national and international conservationists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
Nepal's army chief, tourism minister, diplomats and family members were at Kathmandu's airport for the arrival of the bodies, an AFP reporter said.
The helicopter crashed shortly after take-off from a remote village in eastern Nepal on Saturday, but the rugged, forested terrain and bad weather prevented rescuers from finding the chopper and victims until Monday.
Doctors at Kathmandu's Teaching Hospital have the grim task of identifying the bodies. According to officials, only two corpses could be immediately identified, and only a small quantity of body parts were discovered.
Wednesday was declared a public holiday and a national day of mourning. A memorial service is also planned for Thursday.
The dead included Nepalese Forest Minister Gopal Rai, the Finnish embassy's charge d'affaires Pauli Mustonen, senior WWF officials from Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, and Margaret Alexander, deputy director in Nepal of the US government's international aid arm, USAID.
Newspapers have printed scores of condolence messages from embassies, development organizations and businesses while Nepal's King Gyanendra and Queen Komal said the crash had caused an ""irreparable loss to the nation.""
""Their majesties extend their heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved families and also pray for the eternal peace of the departed souls,"" a message from the palace said.
The WWF had chartered the private helicopter to ferry officials to the handing over of a massive environmental project to the local community.

Nearly 1,500 women linked to opposition parties marched through Kathmandu chanting ""Down with autocratic rule"" but were stopped by police who drove them to detention centres, witnesses said.
Former member of parliament Vidhya Bhandari, telephoning reporters from detention, said more than 1,000 women were detained. Police, however, put the figure at between 250 and 300.
In a separate incident, riot police rounded up more than 500 people who took part in a 4,000-strong demonstration against the king led by ethnic minority activists, witnesses said.
The pro-royal government on April 8 banned demonstrations in Kathmandu after tens of thousands took to the streets demanding that King Gyanendra, who sacked the elected government in October 2002, restore parliamentary democarcy.
The government said the protests could be infiltrated by Maoist rebels who control much of the countryside. Most demonstrators are released within hours of being detained.
King Gyanendra has offered to hold elections by April 2005, but the opposition parties want the dismissal of the royalist prime minister, Surya Bahadur Thapa.

Koirala, 84 and often ailing, was appointed prime minister Thursday, but unspecified lung problems have repeatedly forced him to reschedule his swearing-in.
Koirala was also expected to address Parliament later Sunday and name ministers in his government which would include representatives from all the seven main political parties that formed an alliance to protest the king's seizure of power last year.
After assuming office, Koirala faces the enormous task of keeping the alliance together, along with trying to bring their Maoist rebel allies into talks before announcing elections to a special assembly to rewrite the constitution.
The Maoist rebels declared a cease-fire last week, but made it clear their truce was only for three months.
Koirala's ""biggest task is to bring the Maoists on the right track,"" said Pradeep Gyawali of Communist Party of Nepal
Koirala's party men agree.
""The first task the Cabinet needs to do is declare a cease-fire and begin peace talks,"" said Baldev Majgaiya of Koirala's Nepali Congress party.
""The main challenge for him is to manage the arms and the militia the Maoists have. They have the guns and the training and the prime minister has to make sure they don't have the guns during the elections,"" Majgaiya said.
Besides the Maoist issue, party lawmakers are demanding all the orders and laws of the previous government be invalidated and that the king be stripped of control over the 90,000-strong army, fearing he could use its loyalty to propel himself into power again.
They are demanding the laws be amended immediately so the prime minister is the supreme commander of the army and not the king.
The current constitution gives the king broad powers to dismiss governments along with supreme command of the army.
On Saturday, the rebels freed eight of 11 unarmed soldiers they abducted last week despite a cease-fire declaration.
The freed soldiers were handed over to representatives of the rights group INSEC-Nepal in the village of Jitpur, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Katmandu, the group said in a statement. The condition and whereabouts of the three remaining soldiers were still unknown.
The soldiers were captured Thursday in the nearby village of Ramdittha as they headed home from vacation, according to Indresh Dahal, a spokesman for the Royal Nepalese Army.
The abductions came just hours after the rebels had declared a three-month unilateral cease-fire, and it was possible the guerrillas involved did not know of the announcement.
There was no official reaction to the abduction.
On Friday, lawmakers proposed a truce with the Maoists who have battled for a decade to create a communist state as Parliament met for the first time in four years. They also proposed elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution.
On Thursday, the rebels' elusive leader, Prachanda, said his fighters would not attack government targets for three months to allow Parliament time to ready Nepal for elections for the constitutional assembly.

"3443",20054177,"Title: Japanese encephalitis claims 514 lives in India , WHO issues warning.rtf; Date: September 7, 2005 Wednesday 3:28 PM GMT; Text: The official death toll from Japanese encephalitis touched 514 Wednesday in northern India where more than 2,000 children were fighting for their lives against the mosquito-borne disease.
All but three of the dead were children, according to official figures, and doctors said many more deaths have gone unreported.
At least 46 more deaths were reported in the previous 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh state, adding to an earlier toll of 468, health officials said.
The encephalitis outbreak which erupted at the end of July has been centred in Gorakhpur, close to the border with Nepal, where more than 400 have died, a spokeswoman for the government's epidemic health control room told AFP.
""We are still computing the casualty figures but the maximum number of deaths have occurred in Gorakhpur,"" she said, asking not to be named.
""The number of encephalitis patients too have gone up by 50 to 2,150 in various (state-owned) hospitals,"" she said in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with 180 million people.
The illness has been reported in 25 of the 70 Uttar Pradesh districts.
Symptoms of the disease, which passes from pigs to humans via mosquito bites, include headaches, seizures and high fever.
""This is a man-made disaster,"" said T.N. Dhole, chief microbiologist at the state-owned Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute in Lucknow.
Worst-hit Gorakhpur district is crowded with 3.86 million people, Dhole said, adding that 20 percent of them were in the ""vulnerable"" age group"".
""The environment is dirty and the situation has been compounded by government neglect,"" Dhole said.
""It's too late to do anything except for massive fogging (spraying of insecticides) in these areas,"" he said. ""But the state government... just doesn't have the money.""
Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said he was awaiting approval from New Delhi to buy 15 million vaccines to innoculate children.
The state was looking to China and other vaccine-producing countries for supplies, he said as the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned routine vaccination against the disease in India was inadequate and needed to be boosted.
""We see this problem continuously, and the countries should develop their capacity to improve the vaccine coverage, together with mosquito control,"" Nikki Shinto, a WHO disease response specialist, told AFP in Geneva.
""It's not very expensive. Lots of the Asian countries have very good vaccination coverage except for countries like Nepal and India. I don't really think the coverage is good enough.
""It has to be part of childhood regular vaccinations. It's endemic, and it's difficult to eliminate mosquitoes in those conditions,"" she added.
Health workers in Uttar Pradesh bemoaned lack of early preventive action to save lives and contested official casualty figures.
""Encephalitis has turned into an epidemic in eastern Uttar Pradesh where thousands of people, mostly children, are affected,"" said Shalini Raman from the privately-run Voluntary Health Association.
""Also the potency of the vaccines being manufactured by (state-owned) Central Research Institute need to be re-establshed,"" she said and added the toll was likely to be much higher.
""We're collecting figures from various agencies in the field and our estimate is between 1,000 and 1,500 children are dead,"" she told AFP.
""It occurs every year but this year the disease went out of control in places like Gorakhpur because of government neglect. It's criminal.""
Gorakhpur district lies 250 kilometres (155 miles) from Lucknow.
Some 81 percent of the population live in 3,319 villages, but Gorakhpur has only three major state-run hospitals and has six beds for every 1,000 people.
""This disease strikes only those suffering from malnutrition and so it is stalking slums and villages where no medical facilities are available,"" Raman said.
Japanese encephalitis has claimed more than 3,500 lives in Uttar Pradesh since its first major outbreak in 1978. A quarter of those infected die, and another quarter develop mental or physical disabilities.

"7794",20114501,"Title: Rao begins Nepal visit under arms row shadow.rtf; Date: January 19, 2011 Wednesday; Text: KATHMANDU: Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao began her three-day visit to Nepal Tuesday under the shadow of an arms row between the caretaker government of Nepal and the opposition Maoist party though the Indian government was not involved.
It's official now, finally. Starved of arms and ammunition since 2005, when King Gyanendra staged an army-backed coup, Nepal's security forces are now getting fresh ammo. However, contrary to reports in a section of the Indian media, the largesse is not coming from the Indian government, that stopped lethal military assistance soon after the royal coup in protest.
Nepal's home minister Bhim Rawal Tuesday clarified that the government is getting ingredients for making ammunition for the sake of training security forces. Rawal said the agreement had been made during an earlier Nepali financial year when Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda had visited India. There was nothing untoward about the purchase and it did not construe a violation of the peace agreement signed between the Maoists and the ruling parties in 2006 that saw both sides pledge not to amass further arms or soldiers.
According to media reports in Nepal, the deal is with the Hinduja Group's Gulf Oil Corporation Ltd in Hyderabad, India's largest manufacturer of explosives and detonators. Nepal is reportedly buying safety pins to make grenades in its own factory in Hetauda and bullet cups to manufacture ammunition in Sundarijal. The reports also said Nepal waited till the UN Mission in Nepal, that had been monitoring the state and Maoists' adherence to the peace accord, exited to ask for delivery of the consignment. There was no immediate official reaction to the reports.
On Tuesday, Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda met Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal to ask about the procurement of arms. The Maoists' prime concern however was that Nepal was obtaining lethal arms from the Indian government. The Maoists also put off talks with the 27 other parliamentary parties Tuesday to discuss the formation of an all-party government due to a fresh intra-party clash between Prachanda and his deputy, Dr Baburam Bhattarai. Even the parliamentary meeting scheduled for Tuesday had to be deferred after the Maoists and the two major ruling parties, the Nepali Congress and communists, could not agree on a new mode of prime ministerial election.
Against this backdrop of renewed differences and distrust, Rao began her Nepal visit to assess the progress made in bilateral commitments and the peace process in Nepal. The foreign secretary wraps up her visit Thursday, a day before the deadline given to the parties by the President, Dr Ram Bara Yadav, to form a consensus government, comes to an end. Rao said her visit was not intended to interfere in the internal affairs of Nepal.

Matrika Yadav, who had been the minister for forest and soil conservation since the Maoists joined the government in April, said in a statement he was forced to resign because the government ignored his repeated calls to settle the problems that have led to violent demonstrations in southern Nepal.
Several ethnic groups have been organizing strikes, transportation shutdowns and demonstrations this year to demand greater rights for minorities in the south. More than 70 people have died in the violence.
Yadav, who comes from the south, resigned Thursday evening, leaving four Maoist ministers remaining in the Cabinet.
Many southerners say their region has been sidelined in favor of the more populated, mountainous north. They are demanding greater autonomy, more seats in the national legislature and a guaranteed number of representatives in the administration.
Yadav also said he got no cooperation from the home minister when he tried to stop timber smuggling, and said the government had taken no initiative to find out about the hundreds of people missing during the fighting between government troops and Maoists.
There was no initial official reaction from the prime minister's office.
The Maoists joined the government and Parliament this year after striking a peace deal with the government to end a decades-long communist insurgency.

 Kathmandu, 5 May: Leaders of five political parties fighting political regression have a pre-condition for talks with the king: he should be ready to discuss political issues.
 Earlier, Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala said prohibitory orders should be lifted and arrested persons should be released before talks.
 Both the conditions were met after government withdrew prohibitory orders at midnight Monday 3 May ; but after differences between agitating workers and parties, new pre-conditions were set.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 6 May 04
The reason to repeatedly change conditions for talks is also the difference in priority of the agitating political parties. Among the agitating political parties, Nepali Congress, Janamorcha Nepal, Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party and Nepal Sadbavana Party (Ananda Debi) want the restoration of the dissolved parliament; the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist, Leninist) CPN-UML wants an all-party government.
 Four parties at the last meeting in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu pushed for the lifting of prohibitory orders and the release of arrested persons while the CPN-UML called for the resignation of Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa.
 As easy as it may seem to reach to reach an understanding between the agitating political parties in the fight against regression, it is difficult to put forward a common candidate for prime minister.
 It will not be easy even if the king asks the five parties to from an all-party government with the agreement of Maoists. Last year, the five parties had put forward CPN-UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal as a common candidate.
 After Nepali Congress party president Girija Prasad Koirala demonstrated some flexibility, the chairman of the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party, Narayanman Bijukakchaya (Rohit), said Koirala should not meet the king without the consent of five parties.
 Rohit told Annapurna Post on Wednesday 5 May that the emphasis of his party is the restoration of the dissolved parliament by the Supreme Court instead of the king.  passage omitted

 The police seized four AK-47 rifles and three 9mm pistols in the incident, the report said. They are looking for the three Nepali Maoists who went to Rachi to buy the arms. They were from Gulmi District west-central Nepal , according to police.
 On 19 June, Nepal police arrested Pappu Yadav from Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu. Yadav is now in police custody facing court charges for arms supply and other crimes.

He called upon the UN as well as the international community to help prevent the conflict-induced displacement of people in Nepal.
  The representative of the UN Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Walter Kalin said, ""The number of IDPs is far greater than the rough figure of 8,000 quoted by the government here. Some estimates put it beyond one million."" He added, ""Many of them have already crossed into India.""
  Currently on a tour of conflict-hit districts, Kalin said enumeration of IDPs had become difficult basically owing to their movement to India, their fear to declare themselves and restrictive registration methods.
  Kalin condemned the emergence of anti-Maoist self-defence or vigilante groups, ""some of which have got tacit or explicit support of individual government officials."" This, he added, may expose the people to severe risks or may lead to more displacement.
  (Since the February 1 royal takeover, thousands of Nepalese crossed into UP and Bihar after Communist rebels allegedly retaliated against the killing of several of their comrades by vigilantes in Kapilvastu and Nawalparasi districts).
  Kalin said people were living their homes due to fear of reprisals from both Maoists and security forces. He called upon Kathmandu to formulate a comprehensive policy that will provide for the rights and needs of all IDPs.

At least 20 people, including 10 policemen, were injured in Kaliya town in the fighting, local administrator Bhola Prasad Shivakoti told AFP by telephone from Bara district 220 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
""One protester has been killed in police firing,"" he said.
Shivakoti said police opened fire ""in self-defence in response to someone firing in the crowd at police.""
The violence over demands by the Mahadhesi community for greater political representation has erupted in a country which only recently saw an end to ten years of civil war between government forces and Maoist insurgents.
The situation remained tense in Kaliya town as protesters defied a curfew imposed on Saturday afternoon, setting ablaze government offices and torching an ambulance, Shivakoti said.
The violence in Kaliya, previously untouched by the protests, came as authorities lifted a curfew in three towns in the Terai region and maintained it in two others.
In Birgunj town where the curfew remained, protesters defied it by burning tyres, chief district officer Shambhu Koirala told AFP.
""Some protesters pelted stones (at police) and tried to burn two police posts in the town. The situation is tense and there are reports of clashes between police and demonstrators but no arrests have been made,"" he said.
The protests began after a teenage boy was shot dead on January 19 during a fight between Maoists and activists belonging to the Mahadhesi community.
Mahadhesi leaders say the group accounts for a third of impoverished Nepal's 27 million people and that the Maoists are over-represented in the nation's new parliament.
The parliament was set up after Maoist rebels and the coalition government signed a peace deal to bring the insurgents into government.
The Mahadhesi dominate the Terai plains region, known as Nepal's bread basket, and have long complained of discrimination by highland communities.
The protests, which began in Lahan Bazaar town and spread, became ethnic clashes after the Mahadhesi began attacking people from the hill regions.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has called on the group to begin talks and the Mahadhesis have urged him to name a date.
On Friday, Koirala met with Maoist chairman Prachanda to seek a way to settle the unrest in the Himalayan nation.
Nepal's Maoists have said pro-royalists are involved in the protests and are trying to undermine the peace process which has left King Gyanendra facing dismissal.
The UN chief's personal representative to Nepal's peace process called Friday for an end to the violent protests and said such bloodshed could disrupt crucial elections due to be held later this year.

Kathmandu: Even before the ink of the agreement between Maoist Chairman Prachanda and the leaders of the seven political parties has dried, Maoist workers have abducted 16 persons including opposition political workers.
A group of Maoists abducted six workers of the Nepali Congress [NC] from Dumraha village in Sunsari district on Friday [16 June]. The Maoists seized the NC workers by the collars and beat them up as they took them towards unknown place. A group of about 25 Maoists had abducted the NC workers from a tea stall, according to the kin of the abducted workers.
Those abducted are Ram Kumar Chaudhari, Bhola Chaudhari, Shyam Dev Mandal, Satya Narayan Urav, Ram Sevak Chaudhari and Siddhi Ram Chaudhari all from Dumraha village. [passage omitted: The kin of the abducted have appealed for safe release of their near and dear ones]

Days after signing a peace accord with the communist rebels to end a decade-old insurgency that claimed more than 13,000 lives, there was no sign of the interim parliament mandated in the accord, officials said.
Maoist leader Prachanda, who goes by one name, was planning to meet with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to express the rebels' concerns, said Dev Gurung, a member of the communist rebels' peace talks team.
""These delays are causing the people to lose faith in us,"" Gurung said. ""It appears the government is not serious about following the agreement.""
The government denied the accusations, saying officials had been busy with other issues related to the peace process.
Tourism Minister Pradeep Gyawali, a government negotiator, said they have been occupied by talks with the Maoists and the United Nations on setting up and operating camps where the Maoist fighters would be confined and their weapons locked.
""The interim parliament may have been delayed by maybe a week, but we are all involved in the peace process,"" Gyawali said.
Under the peace deal, the Maoists are to get 73 of the 330 seats in the interim parliament. Koirala's Nepali Congress party will remain the largest bloc, with 85 seats, while the Maoists' number of seats will equal that held by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist). The rest of the seats will be shared among other, smaller parties.
After joining the interim parliament, the rebels are scheduled by Dec. 1 to be part of an interim government that will conduct crucial elections next year.

About 4 million people were in Karbala for the festival observing the birthday of Imam al-Mahdi al-Muntadhar, a 9th-century religious leader, said Iraqi armed forces general command spokesman Brig. Qassim al-Musawi.
The festival attracts pilgrims from across the Arab world, as well as from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and India, authorities said.
Iraqi army Maj. Gen. Samir Abdullah said Friday that security forces ""have tightened their control on the ground and our only concern now is rockets launched from a far distance."" Cars have been banned since Wednesday.
In Baghdad, a car bomb struck a U.S. military convoy, killing at least two passers-by and wounding five, police said. The U.S. military command said three coalition troops were wounded and were being treated in a military hospital.
Iraqi authorities said police foiled an attempted car suicide bombing against a police station near a mosque in Baghdad's northern Azamiyah neighborhood. Police shot the bomber, detonating the explosives in his car, before he reached the police station, the Interior Ministry announced. But the blast killed one policeman and wounded 10 civilians, the ministry said.
In Karbala, authorities said 7,000 police, along with 2,000 Iraqi soldiers and 1,800 Interior Ministry commandos were securing the city, while Interior Ministry special forces were guarding its entrance.
The U.S.-led coalition was providing air support for the security measures, Iraqi Army Maj. Gen. Samir Abdullah said Friday. The coalition said it would ""be on hand for support if needed,"" but could not reveal further details for security reasons.
Many people walk to Karbala, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad, from across the country, and there have been several attacks against processions heading to the city.
On Friday, three mortars struck a group of pilgrims in Musayyib, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Baghdad, killing three and wounding 22.
Five days earlier, Iraqi soldiers clashed with gunmen near Karbala, leaving 14 militants and one Iraqi soldier dead. Last week, 13 Pakistani and Indian Shiite pilgrims and their Iraqi driver were ambushed and killed as they drove to the city.
Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, hundreds of people have been killed in attacks in Karbala, mostly involving suicide bombers. The attacks are considered to have been the work of Sunni Arab extremist groups, including al-Qaida in Iraq, that consider Shiites to be heretics and American collaborators.
""We arrested two terrorists who were trying to enter Karbala and they confessed that there were other elements who wanted to enter and target Shiites,"" Karbala governor Aqil al-Khazali said Friday.
In the capital, the parked car bomb exploded in eastern part of the city. At least two pedestrians were killed and five were wounded, while the blast also struck a passing U.S. military convoy, police 1st Lt. Ali Abbas said. U.S. soldiers cordoned off the area around a burned-out Humvee, and military officials said three coalition troops had been wounded.
In Baghdad's central Karradah district, gunmen shot and killed Abdul Karim al-Rubaiei, a technician of Iraq's government-run newspaper al-Sabah, and wounded his driver, police said.
In a separate attack, roadside bomb targeting a police foot patrol in east Baghdad wounded two policemen, while two Iraqi soldiers were wounded by another roadside bomb which had apparently been intended to strike a U.S.-Iraqi convoy in the northern part of the capital, police said.
A bomb planted in a generator in central Baghdad also wounded two civilians, police said.
The Interior Ministry announced that police had arrested a suspect planting a roadside bomb in the Dora neighborhood and had found a bomb factory in a subsequent search of the man's house.
In the center of the city, a bomb exploded as a man planted it by the side of a road, killing the man and wounding another person, and damaging two civilian cars, police Lt. Thair Mahmoud said.
South of the capital, Iraqi police arrested a man found with 400 hand grenades and four bombs in his car in the al-Hamiyah area about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Baghdad, police 1st Lt. Osama Ahmed said.
In the northern city of Kirkuk, 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the capital, two roadside bombs planted four meters (yards) from each other exploded as a police foot patrol passed by, killing four people, including one policeman, and wounding 16 others, said police Col. Taiyb Taha.
Police also found an unidentified body which was blindfolded and had its hands and feet bound, in the Tigris River in Suwayah, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Baghdad. The body had been shot several times, said Mamoun Ajil al-Rubaie of the morgue in the city of Kut.

The Federation of Nepalese Journalists, an umbrella body of media rights groups, said two journalists were killed by the Maoist rebels while three were killed by the government side since fighting that has followed the collapse of peace talks in August.
An additional 68 journalists were detained during the same period for questioning, some of them held for months while 31 were reported to have been abused or even tortured by the authorities.
""The freedom and rights of press and journalists has been curtailed in Nepal,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri, general secretary of the Federation. ""We are being targeted and harassed by both sides of the conflict.""
Journalists in Nepal have faced increasing threats from both government troops and rebels since fighting resumed.
The rebels have targeted journalists for writing articles critical of the insurgency and driven them out of their homes. At least six journalists have been reported missing without a trace in the past seven months, among 12 who disappeared in the past two years.
The three journalists killed by government troops were believed to have close links with the rebels and had written articles in pro-rebel publications.
International media rights groups like Paris-based Reporters Without Borders and New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists have been repeatedly asking the Nepal government to stop harassing journalists.
The group has cited arrests, murders and kidnappings of journalists in this Himalayan kingdom.
At one point Nepal was named the biggest jail for journalists.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.
More than 9,500 people have been killed since the insurgency began.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the truce fell apart, and hundreds of rebels have been reportedly killed.
Police detained nearly 200 journalists over the weekend in Katmandu while covering protests against the king. Some of them were also injured in the scuffle with the police.
Nisthuri said they are now demanding the resignation of the information minister.

The 50-year-old Russian citizen was identified as Evegeny Alexandrov and was found dead Sunday in his rented apartment in Katmandu with two suicide notes, said police official Bikash Khanal.
The notes were written in Russian, Khanal said. Police were investigating the case.
The United Nations office in Nepal said Alexandrov was not a U.N. staff member but was part of a helicopter crew hired for a peacekeeping mission involving former communist rebels. Alexandrov was involved in maintaining the aircraft.
Khanal said the helicopter's three-member Russian and Belorussian crew, who died in the crash, were Alexandrov's colleagues and had been sharing the same apartment. The other seven who died were all U.N. staff three Nepalese, a South Korean, an Indonesian, a Gambian and a Swedish citizen.
All 10 on board were killed when the chopper crashed in bad weather a week ago.
The Nepalese government and the U.N. were investigating the crash. No possible cause has been disclosed.
The helicopter went down as it was returning to Katmandu from a visit to an eastern Nepal camp where former communist rebel fighters have been confined under U.N. supervision as part of a peace deal.
The U.N. has been helping with Nepal's peace process since 2006, when the rebels gave up their armed revolt and joined mainstream politics.

About 30,000 schools throughout the country have closed down for an indefinite period from today, not even a month after the new school session began. More than 5 million students have had their schooling obstructed by the closure.
The Republican Education Forum, a conglomerate of eight organizations including Maoist students and teachers, has put forward various demands closing down all the private and government schools in the country.
Meanwhile, operators of private schools went to the prime minister's residence today to hand him a memorandum asking him to find a solution to the periodic closure of schools [by various strikers].

    The survey shows that 14,000 children are involved in unpaid  jobs and 278,000 get paid less than they deserve. Only 6.4 percent of the total child labors have got opportunity for education.
    Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in  1990, one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General  Assembly, and has also signed tow optional protocols on the  involvement of children in armed conflicts and the sale of  children, child prostitution and child pornography, which were  adopted in 2000 and came into force in 2002.

UNITED NATIONS, CMC - The United Nations says the first batch of an expected 350 additional UN peacekeepers has arrived in the Haiti.
The Nepalese troops join 7,200 military personnel from 17 countries already serving in Haiti. 
In a statement, the UN said that the light infantry battalion would be used for operations in Port-au-Prince, as part of the plan by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Haiti's (MINUSTAH) to intensify efforts against criminal gangs operating in the capital city. 
""I am determined to increase the pressure on the gangs who have been holding the innocent people of Haiti hostage for so long,"" said Force Commander, Major General Carlos Albert Dos Santos Cruz. 
The statement said MINUSTAH was maintaining round-the-clock surveillance of the area, pointing out that last week it had launched an operation to gain control of a house used as a staging ground by gangs to commit crimes and shoot at UN troops. 
On Monday, Edmond Mulet, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative and head of MINUSTAH, addressed the Security Council, which met in closed consultations to discuss MINUSTAH's mandate, set to end on February 15. 
Mulet told reporters afterwards that despite progress in rebuilding the economy and restoring the rule of law, Haiti is still characterised by polarisation, lack of institutions and a ""certain level of violence"". 
""""But if you compare the picture today with the time the mission arrived, you will see that there has been a very positive evolution,"" added Mulet, who presented the Security Council with a report on Haiti.

"5737",20071231,"Title: Have-Nots Rebel As India Blossoms.rtf; Date: May 18, 2007 Friday 7:10 PM GMT; Text: After the paved roads have ended and the dirt roads have crumbled into winding footpaths, after the last power line has vanished into the forest behind you, a tall, red monument suddenly appears at the edge of a clearing.
It's 25 feet high and topped by a hammer and sickle, honoring a fallen warrior. White letters scroll across the base: ""From the blood of a martyr, new generations will bloom like flowers.""
The monument is a memorial but also a signpost, a warning that you are entering a ""Liberated Zone"" a place where Mao is alive and Marx is revered, where an army of leftist guerrillas known as the Naxalites control a shadow state amid the dense forests, isolated villages and shattering poverty of central India. Here, the Indian government is just a distant, hated idea.
""The capitalists and other exploiters of the masses feel increasingly vulnerable. And they should,"" said a 33-year-old man known only as Ramu, a regional commander of the Naxalites' People's Liberation Guerrilla Army. He cradled an assault rifle as he sat on the dirt floor of a small farmhouse, temporary base for two dozen fighters set amid the forests of Chhattisgarh state. ""For them, the danger is rising.""
Initially formed in 1967, the Maoist army has taken root over the past decade in places left behind during India's spectacular financial rise since its economy was opened up in the early 1990s. Outsiders rarely see their strongholds, but a team from The Associated Press was invited last month into a region they control.
As India has grown wealthier, the Naxalites officially called the Communist Party of India (Maoist) have grown larger, feeding off the anger of the country's poor. There are now 10,000-15,000 fighters in an archipelago of rebel territory scattered across nearly half of the country's 28 states, security officials say.
For years, the government here paid little attention. That began changing two years ago. Today, Chhattisgarh state backs an anti-Naxal militia called the Salwa Judum. And in 2006, India's prime minister called the Naxalites the single largest threat to the country.
Over the past two years, nearly 2,000 people police, militants and civilians caught in the middle have been killed in Naxalite violence. In March, 55 policemen and government-backed militiamen were killed when up to 500 Naxalites descended on an isolated Chhattisgarh police station.
The rebel patchwork reaches from deep inside India to the border with Nepal, where the Naxalites are thought to have informal ties to the Maoists who, after a long insurgency, recently joined in the Katmandu government.
The Maoist goal in India is nothing less than complete takeover.
""There is only one solution to India's problems: Naxalism,"" said Ramu.
The movement takes its name from Naxalbari, a village outside Calcutta where the revolt began in 1967. Inspired by Mao Zedong, founding father of the Chinese communist regime, they believe an army of peasants can one day overthrow the government. The Naxals are strongest in states such as Chhattisgarh that have large populations of ""tribals,"" the indigenous people at the bottom of India's rigid social order.
More than ever, their once-marginal revolt seems like outright war, particularly in the rebel strongholds of rural Chhattisgarh.
India deals with other insurgencies, from Kashmiri separatists to a spectrum of ethnic militant groups in its remote northeast. But the Naxalites have proven different. They have support not just among the poorest or a single ethnic group, and have survived for forty years.
In places like the Dhauli forest, a tangle of vegetation unmarked on most maps 500 miles from Bangalore, 450 miles from Calcutta and 600 miles from New Delhi the Naxalites are more than surviving. They are winning.
""I won't lie to you. We're on the defensive here,"" said a top Chhattisgarh police official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""We have the main roads, but they have the hills and the small roads.""
Here, government officials hold little power. Through much of the countryside, nervous policemen barricade themselves at night inside stations ringed by barbed wire. Politicians dismiss the Naxalites as criminals, but those politicians go nowhere without armies of bodyguards.
Victory, the Naxals insist, is coming.
""We don't have the weapons. We don't have the army,"" said a young fighter named Soni. ""But slowly, slowly, sometime in the future, we will succeed.""
That seems unlikely.
Most of the Naxalites' guns are old or handmade. Their land mines are often made from pressure cookers, and bullets are doled out carefully. Their support in many villages has more to do with fear than genuine belief.
Their control can be fleeting. If security forces move into a Naxalite-run area, the fighters simply disappear into the forests.
But while there's little chance they'll overthrow the government, in this part of India their power is immense. Every day "

 The palace 'has already acquired a Jaguar, a Rolls Royce and another luxury car,' the Kathmandu Post said in a front-paged story Wednesday.
The election budget has also been diverted to beef up security in violence-gripped Nepal, which faces a communist insurgency, the English-language daily said.
 The palace asked the government to purchase the cars for use of the king, another newspaper, Kantipur, wrote Wednesday.
 In a separate case two years ago, the palace had obtained over $1 million for the same purpose, the Nepalese-language daily said.
 An official at the press secretariat of the Nepalese royal palace confirmed that some new cars have recently been obtained to replace old cars, mostly for use during state functions.
 'But these cars are certainly not for private use,' the official told Kyodo News, requesting that he not be named.
 The reports of diversion of the election budget came two days after Home Minister Kamal Thapa said the government is making 'frantic' preparations to hold elections and that the dates will be announced in due course.
 Nepal's parliamentary elections, originally planned for November 2002, remain postponed after Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the Nepalese monarchy threatened to sabotage them.
 Then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba asked King Gyanendra to postpone the elections in the face of the rebels' threat, upon which the king dismissed the premier and seized executive powers for himself on Oct. 4, 2002.

'The parties cannot interact with an unconstitutional government,' Ram Sharan Mahat, representative of the Nepali Congress Party, said after a meeting of five political parties.
The meeting considered a request made Monday by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, and a similar call made earlier by Maoist rebel leader Puspa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, on the political parties to join the third round of peace negotiations.
The parties are protesting King Gyanendra's royal takeover last October in which he assumed full executive powers, including the authority to appoint the prime minister.
They have refused to recognize and work with the government appointed by the king.
The parties are demanding reinstatement of the dissolved parliament and formation of a government of parties represented in the house.
They said peace talks with the rebels can best be held by a government appointed by the parliament, not by the king.
The rebels' political agenda includes a demand for a roundtable conference, formation of an interim government and election of a constituent assembly.
After two rounds of peace talks following the Jan. 29 cease-fire, the rebels have agreed to a third round of negotiations, and Thapa said Monday the talks, which would start anytime soon, would focus on political matters.
The rebels want a new constitution to replace the Constitution of 1990, which provides for constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy.
Before the cease-fire, more than 8,000 people had died in fighting that began in February 1996, when the Maoists announced the start of a 'people's war' to topple the monarchy.

He said the four planned to continue their trek.
Marzena Staniszewska, Wojcich Mysiara, Konrad Kakolewski and Maria Los had called colleagues via satellite phone on March 23 and said they had been abducted by the rebels, according to Bharat Kumar Ghimire, general secretary of the Nepal Esperanto Association where two of the trekkers worked.
The incident happened at Jiri, 320 kilometres (200 miles) east of Kathmandu, the start of a popular trek through the Everest region. It prompted a search after the four could not be contacted.
The rebels control big swathes of the countryside outside the capital Kathmandu and normally charge tourists a ""tax."" 
But attacks on or abductions of foreigners are rare because tourists are an important source of income in the countryside. The rebels regularly admit taking local people for indoctrination sessions before releasing them unharmed.
The rebels are waging a decade-long campaign to install a communist republic in which 12,500 people have died.

""There are scores of Tibetan political prisoners in Tibet,"" said Thubten Lungrig, minister for religion and culture in the Tibetan government-in-exile, based in India's northern hill station of Dharamsala.
The minister, in a letter to Tibetan support groups worldwide, said he hoped an ongoing visit to China by two envoys of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama would help improve the situation.
He said he deplored the continued detention of the Panchen Lama,a key figure in Tibetan Buddhism, whose whereabouts is unknown since China kidnapped him in 1995 when he was six years old.
The Dalai Lama had chosen Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the reincarnation of the former Panchen Lama, who died in 1989.
The Chinese police placed the boy under house arrest and later Beijing selected its own candidate for Panchen Lama.
Lungrig described Nepal's recent deportation of 18 Tibetans as a ""shocking incident.""
The Tibetans, eight aged under 16, entered Nepal in April hoping to reach Dharamsala, but were arrested for not having valid travel documents. On Saturday they were handed over to Chinese embassy officials.
Tibetan activists fear they will be punished, perhaps in a labour camp, upon their return to Tibet.
The minister also expressed concern over the status of Tibetan activist Tulku Tenzin Delek who received a death sentence with a two-year reprieve.
A Chinese court handed down the sentence for his involvement in carrying out three bombings that killed one person and left three injured.

""We're in touch with the Maoists and have already initiated the process of releasing their activists,"" Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula told a news conference, adding preparations for talks with the rebels were well under way.
The rebels later renewed their call for the release of their fighters and said the goverment must account for activists who disappeared in custody.
""Unless all political detainees are released and all those who have been disappeared have been made public we will not take part in talks,"" rebel chief Prachanda said in an emailed statement.
Nepal's new government and the rebels declared ceasefires after King Gyanendra gave up absolute rule last month following mass pro-democracy protests backed by the Maoists.
Some 1,200 rebels are in prisons across Nepal, and in the last decade nearly 1,000 people -- rebels and civilians -- have disappeared while in police and army custody, according to figures compiled by the rights group the Informal Sector Service Centre.
Local media had reported earlier that Maoist prisoners had begun hunger strikes in a bid to speed their release but Prachanda called on them to stop.
""The government has shown a positive attitude towards the issue of releasing all detainees and has expressed commitment to freeing prisoners so we ask the detainees to stop their hunger strike programmes,"" he said.
Two top Maoists were released after murder charges against them were dropped last week but most remain behind bars.
King Gyanendra sacked the government and seized control of the Himalayan nation in February 2005 in a move he said was needed to stem the revolt.
The rebels, who want a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution, say they are willing to join the political mainstream and accept multi-party democracy.

The children were killed instantly when the homemade bomb exploded Friday at a house in Basouti village, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of the capital Katmandu, said security officials reached by telephone in Dhangadhi, the main town in the area.
Of the five hurt in the blast, two are critically injured and have been rushed to a hospital, the officials said on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media. The others are receiving treatment at a clinic in nearby Hasulia village.
They said police are probing the explosion but that initial investigations indicated Maoist rebels have been training and sheltering in the jungles nearby.
The officials said the children may have found the bomb in the jungle and taken it back home, but did not rule out that it may have been planted in the house.
The chief military official in the area, Brig. Gen. Dipak Gurung, said the bomb was likely left by the rebels because government troops did not use that type of explosives.
Rebel commander Lekhraj Bhatta said by telephone he has ordered an immediate probe into the incident.
The rebels, who began fighting government troops in 1996 for a communist state, declared a 0cease-fire and began peace talks with the government in April.

"868",20032730,"Title: South Korean girls separated two weeks after Iranian sisters' death.rtf; Date: July 22, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Singapore doctors Tuesday successfully separated two South Korean infant girls fused at the pelvis two weeks after the tragic death of conjoined adult Iranian sisters in the same hospital.
""The Korean twins have been successfully separated,"" Prem Kumar Nair, spokesman for the Raffles Hospital, told journalists about four hours after the operation on Min Sa-rang and her sister Ji-hye began.
""From what I know at this moment, the twins are separated and well in the operating theatre,"" Nair said as the girls underwent post-operative treatment, including plastic and reconstructive surgery.
The operation took place 14 days after 29-year-old Iranian twins joined at the head, Laleh and Ladan Bijani, died within 90 minutes of each other from massive blood loss after an unprecedented operation to separate them.
Experts said separating infant twins has a higher chance of success than surgery on conjoined adults. The Bijani twins had insisted on surgery despite repeated warnings that one or both of them could die.
Nair said the case of the South Korean girls was ""simpler than the Laleh and Ladan operation"" but still complicated since it involved several organs.
The girls were ""symmetrical ischiopagus tetrapod twins,"" and were the first of their kind operated on here, according to a hospital statement, adding Ji-hye means ""wisdom"" and Sa-rang means ""love"" in Korean.
The surgery on the girls was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of 16 specialists with the help of around 50 medical support staff.
They were led by Dr. Yang Ching Yu, deputy medical director of Raffles Hospital, and Dr. Keith Goh, consultant neurosurgeon, who also led the operation on the Iranian twins.
""Separation surgery is essential to enable the girls to walk and to develop as normal children,"" the hospital statement said.
Singapore doctors also led by Goh successfully separated a pair of 11-month-old Nepalese twins joined at the head, Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, on April 10, 2001 after 97 hours of surgery.
Hospital spokesman Nair said the twins were expected to be in the intensive care unit for at least five days and would possibly spend another week in a normal ward.
He said the twins would ""have to undergo rehabilitation, some training,"" including teaching them how to walk.
The operation and the pre-surgery tests cost about 50,000 Singapore dollars (28,400 US), Nair said.
""The medical team have waived all their fees for this surgery. The hospital has discounted some of the fees as well and the twins' parents have also made partial payment....""
Compared to the international media frenzy surrounding the Bijanis' operation, hospital staff and family members of the South Korean girls took pains to keep the infants' surgery as private as possible.
Operating team co-leader Yang, a consultant colorectal surgeon, said ""the girls have to be separated at this stage because if we wait any longer, they may develop severe skull and spinal deformities.""
""Without separation they would never walk normally,"" he added.
The twins' parents had sought a second opinion from experts in London before eventually deciding on an operation in Singapore, where the girls had undergone preliminary tests in June.
Their father Min Seung-joon earlier told the Korea Times newspaper that he had been told by the Singapore doctors that his daughters had an 85 percent chance of survival.
He said Ladan and Laleh Bijani had met his daughters at the hospital before the Iranian twins' deaths on July 8.
""The Bijani sisters encouraged us ...,"" said the father, adding that he cried upon learning of the Iranian women's deaths.
Born on March 3, Sa-rang and Ji-hye cannot see each other face to face as they are joined at the lower spine.
""I just wish to see them grow up and enter elementary school,"" their father said before the surgery.

In Accham, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of Kathmandu, security forces and Maoist rebels have been battling since Sunday, an army official said.
Afternoon newspapers in the capital said heavy casualties were feared in the clash but did not speculate on the death toll.
""An exchange of fire is still going on, but we haven't received news yet on casualties,"" the army official told AFP late Monday.
In Bhojpur, about 225 kilometers (135 miles) west of Kathmandu, 15 Maoists were killed Monday in an early-morning battle, private Kantipur FM radio reported.
Details of violence in Nepal are often slow to emerge because of the Himalayan kingdom's rugged terrain and often rudimentary communication network.
The Maoists have fought since 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state, in an insurgency that has left nearly 7,800 people dead, according to army figures.

    ""The valley life is normal. Dwellers are not panicking over the so-called blockade, as the government has been able to keep the  price of food items and petroleum products under control,"" Deputy  Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari told reporters here Monday.
    He also called on the owners of the closed industries and  hotels to resume business, reaffirming the government's commitment to provide security to them.
    ""We are ready to sit for peace talks without any conditions  with the rebels, and we will present ourselves with maximum  flexibility in the talks if it takes place,"" he added.
    The guerrillas announced an indefinite blockade targeting Nepal 's capital since Aug. 18. They attempted to block three main entry points in and around the Kathmandu Valley in a bid to force the  government to accept their pre-condition for peace talks,  including re-writing the Constitution.
    This is the first time the country's capital is blocked by the  insurgents, since they imposed a similar embargo in the western  Nepal for nearly one month earlier this year.
    The highway leading south and west serves as the capital's  lifeline of about 1.5 million population, the main route for  bringing in food, cooking gas, petroleum products and other  essentials. The other highway also links the Kathmandu Valley with Nepal's northern neighbor China, making it a vital trade route.
    During the first day of the blockade last Wednesday, the  highways saw only 67 vehicles entered in the Valley. However, when the blockade entered its seventh day on Tuesday, the volume of  traffic on the highways in the western parts of the capital seems  to have increased considerably.
    According to an officer at a checkpoint, hundreds of tons of  vegetables were supplied to the capital from Monday night to  Tuesday morning. While hundreds of buses and trucks lined up at  the three main entry points in and around the Kathmandu Valley  Tuesday morning, waiting to pass through the security checkpoint.
    Convoys of buses and trucks can be seen following a mine- protected vehicle of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and over-flying  RNA choppers also guarded.
    The government has provided tight security, escorting convoys  of goods-carriers and passenger buses on highways. The security  forces seem to be doing their best, patrolling key strategic  points along the highways.
    The army has mobilized 11 picket teams to guard the highway  from strategic points on hilltops along the 90 kilometers section  of the Prithvi Highway.
    The army base in coordination with the police has mobilized  several teams of security forces in the sensitive sections of the  highway. Besides, troops in plain clothes have been deployed  deeper along the highway to check the possible infiltration of the guerrillas.
    ""We have initiated various measures to ensure security on the  highways that link the capital with other parts of the country and escorting vehicles, running covert operations, picketing on the  highways and also conducting aerial patrolling so with these  security measures in place,"" said RNA General Brigadier Nepal  Bhusan Chand.
    ""There was nothing to be afraid of on the highways."" Chand said, adding, ""There is not a single case of resistance or obstruction,  neither is there any room for one. The highway is under our  control and fully safe.""

"5202",20064585,"Title: Australian Forces Intervene to Halt Fighting in East Timor.rtf; Date: May 26, 2006 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Several hundred Australian commandos landed Thursday in the tiny Indian Ocean nation of East Timor to try to quell escalating fighting in an ethnic dispute involving the country's armed forces and police. 
  Explosions, apparently from grenades, and widespread small-arms fighting were heard across Dili, the capital. Nine people were killed and 27 others were wounded, including two United Nations police advisers, during an attack on the national police headquarters, the United Nations said.
 By midnight, gunshots could still be heard, said an Indonesian diplomat, Budi, who spoke by telephone from his embassy. ''There is danger for everyone in Dili,'' said Mr. Budi, who uses only one name. ''We are protecting about 50 people in the embassy. They are afraid.'' 
  East Timor's foreign minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, appealed for the outside help to disarm ''renegade troops and police rebelling against the state.'' Mr. Ramos-Horta, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said his government could not counter a breakdown of law and order, with about 800 loyal members of the army fighting a group of about 600 rebellious soldiers. 
  An additional 1,300 Australian soldiers, as well as forces from Malaysia and Portugal, the country's former colonial power, are expected in the next several days.
  Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, dispatched a special envoy, Ian Martin, to East Timor on Thursday. Mr. Martin, the United Nations' human rights envoy to Nepal, was Mr. Annan's special representative in East Timor in 1999.
  The violence was the worst since East Timor, an extremely poor country of 800,000 people, gained independence from Indonesia four years ago after a United Nations-sponsored referendum. About 1,000 people died after the referendum as a result of violence by pro-Indonesian militias. 
  The current unrest has been simmering since earlier this year. About 600 members of the army, known as Loromonu, from the western part of the country, went on strike to protest what they contend is ethnic discrimination and a lack of promotions at the hands of the military leadership. 
  In April, the strikers were fired, and they formed a dissident group that has battled the remaining army, made up mostly of Lorosae, from the east. 
  The fighting between the groups intensified this week after many policemen of the same ethnic background as the rebellious soldiers defected to the rebel side, officials said. 
  Because of the fighting, roughly half of a contingent of about 200 Americans, mostly contractors for the United States Agency for International Development, left in the last few weeks, said a Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. All 47 Peace Corps volunteers, many of whom were stationed in remote areas, were evacuated at the beginning of May, he said. 
  The shootings outside the police headquarters on Thursday were the worst bloodshed of the conflict, the Western official said. 
  Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said in New York, based on information from staff members in Dili, that after an hourlong attack at the Dili police headquarters, United Nations police and military advisers had negotiated a cease-fire that was agreed to on condition that police officers surrender their weapons and leave the headquarters unarmed. As they were being escorted out, he said, soldiers opened fire on them, killing 9 police officers and wounding 27 other people, including the 2 United Nations police advisers. 
  In the Australian Parliament, Prime Minister John Howard described the situation as ''exceptionally dangerous.'' He said Australian troops, who have helped train the East Timor armed forces, would try to separate the warring factions and disarm them. The Australians will try to create a secure enough environment to conduct a dialogue that would end the conflict, he said. 
  In a hopeful sign, the Australian commandos were warmly welcomed at the airport by women and children holding signs reading, ''Viva Australia.'' 
  Since gaining independence, East Timor has been almost totally dependent on foreign aid, and that is likely to continue for a long time, experts say. The United Nations Development Program estimates that the life expectancy in East Timor is 57 years. 
  The country, depleted of the coffee and sandalwood that once made it a small trading center, has valuable offshore reserves of natural gas. East Timor recently completed an agreement with Australia to exploit those reserves, but it is not expected to reap the benefits for years. 
  Extreme poverty, especially among young unemployed men, has encouraged the formation of gangs that have taken part in the violence.

Moshe replies: ""To Minsk."" Shmule retorts: ""When you say I go to Minsk, you want me to believe that you go to Pinsk, but I know that you go to Minsk, so why do you lie?"" Z.A. Bhutto told Y.D. Gundevia he was going to Minsk. ""He may have meant us to believe that he was going to Pinsk, but we knew that he was going to Minsk, so why did he lie?""
  Y.D. Gundevia, an able foreign secretary, liked to tell his favourite story to drive home the point that when Bhutto spoke, one had to think furiously to detect exactly what he meant. But all the same, he enjoyed negotiating with Bhutto during several sessions in 1962-63, as did Foreign Minister Swaran Singh, who himself was as slippery as an eel. Indira Gandhi knew of this interlocutor when fate brought them together in June 1972. She concluded the Simla Pact with Bhutto. It remains the bedrock of India's Pakistan policy.
  Diplomacy rests on a wise blend of scepticism and trust. Policy-making rests on the assessment of national interest in the context of the balance of power in the situation that faces the policy-maker. Churchill had no hesitation to saying, ""If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons."" He made a cynical pact with a man he had regarded as the Devil, Josef Stalin, at Moscow on October 9, 1944.
  Churchill recorded, ""I wrote out on a half-sheet of paper: 'Romania/Russia 90 per cent, the others 10 per cent; Greece/Great Britain 90 per cent (in accord with the US), Russia 10 per cent; Yugoslavia 50-50 per cent,Hungary 50-50 per cent; Bulgaria/Russia 75 per cent, the others 25 per cent...' He (Stalin) made a tick upon it and passed it back to us."" Churchill suggested. ""Let us burn this paper."" Stalin replied, ""No, you keep it."" The deal rested on trust. It collapsed when the trust eroded during the Cold War.
  Necessity had forced the two to trust each other. Churchill testified that Stalin kept his part of the bargain and sold the Greek Communists away just as he had sent the German Communists to their deaths after his pact with Hitler in 1939.
  Leaders are those who consciously discard the crippling legacies of the past, break the mould which imprisons them and take sensible risks. Certitude has little place in the conduct of foreign affairs.
  Richard Nixon dismissed the doubts of his National Security Advisor Henry A. Kissinger and decided to make an opening to the People's Republic of China. Kissinger regarded the move as foolish and impossible of success. On his part, Mao Zedong formed a study group of four wise men, retired marshals of the People's Liberation Army, led by former Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi. All counselled acceptance of Nixon's overtures; this was not because they trusted him, but because their country's national interest rendered it necessary. Sino-Soviet relations were then at an all-time low.
  One was amazed at TV anchors posing the question and inviting viewers' responses - a sport that has lost whatever little charm it ever had - ""Can we trust China's President Hu Jintao?"". Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been a particular target of such distrust. During the Agra summit in 2001, he happened to see one such programme and was hurt. These questions reflect an outlook that is chauvinistic and reveals crass ignorance of the very nature of diplomacy. Summits are organised precisely to size up what we can gain from the visitor. The BJP regime itself wrecked the Agra summit and sold a whole package of falsehoods to cover it up. Uniquely in diplomacy, Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh took turns to denigrate Musharraf for well nigh a fortnight.
  In the Rajya Sabha, on August 10, 2001, the then Leader of the Opposition, Manmohan Singh, punctured the balloon by hinting at the tell-tale draft of Clause 1 written out by Jaswant Singh in his own hand as a finale to the accord: ""I know that he (Jaswant Singh) did provide a lot of technical assistance to the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to correct his English and, according to various accounts, he and Abdul Sattar had jointly initialled a draft, and I think, it was left to Advaniji in the cabinet committee on security to shoot down the draft.""He was on target. That handwritten document was published without any contradiction by Jaswant Singh. His memoirs ignore the embarrassing revelation.
  One wonders at his level of trust of Taliban leaders when he escorted four prisoners held in our jails for safe delivery at Kandahar. He had walked into their den; on trust, surely. How and where does trust come in on the Sino-Indian boundary dispute, pray? Official maps attached to the two White Papers on our
  Indian states, in 1948 and 1959, showed the entire boundary from its Sino-Afghan-Indian trijunction in the west right down to the Sino-Nepal-Indian trijunction as 'undefined'.

Authorities in Nepal declared a curfew on the capital and issued orders to shoot violators on sight Thursday when opposition parties have called a mass anti-royal rally.
""The curfew has been imposed from 2:00 am until 8:00 pm due to security reasons,"" said Kathmandu's chief administrator Shushil Ghimire. ""Anyone found violating curfew orders will be shot on sight.""
The rally in defiance of a ban on public meetings would mark the start of the third week of a general strike that has crippled Nepal.

""We have discovered a huge cache of explosives and the Maoists were planning to use human shields to create violence. They have been forcing people to join in the protests,"" he charged.
At least 10 people have been killed during demonstrations that have swept the Himalayan kingdom demanding the king restore full-party democracy. Hundreds more have been injured and arrested.

In coordinated protests in each of the Himalayan country's 75 districts, Nepali Congress activists handed over memoranda to local officials insisting Gyanendra withdraw his October proclamation ousting the elected prime minister.
About 1,000 people marched in the capital Kathmandu, with smaller numbers reported in district headquarters across the kingdom. No violence was reported, home ministry officials said.
The protest letter urged Gyanendra, who is officially a constitutional monarch, to reinstate the parliament and ""vest the sovereign and executive rights in the people as per the constitution,"" Nepali Congress central secretary Sobhakar Parajuli told AFP.
Gyanendra on October 4 sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent,"" and took power for a week before appointing staunch monarchist Lokendra Bahadur Chand as interim premier.
Chand will remain in office until new elections are held, but no poll dates have been announced. Gyanendra suspended a parliamentary vote Deuba had called for November 2002.
The protests Monday were led by the Nepali Congress faction headed by former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
Deuba, in a bitter rivalry with Koirala, was ousted from the Nepali Congress after he called the election last year. He has since formed a separate party.

  In its 1400-page long report, the commission has recommended the Government to take necessary action against two hundred and two persons including King Gyanendra.
  The panel headed by former Supreme Court Justice Krishna Jung Rayamajhi has held the King responsible for the April 2006 violent clampdown and misappropriating State resources.
  Rayamajhi said that they have made the report as per the people's aspiration respecting the Rule of Law.
  He also said that they had documented all the incidents of rights violations during the People's Movement, Nepalnews reported.
  The panel had interrogated 294 persons during the course of investigation.
  It had also sent a questionnaire to King Gyanendra asking to clarify his role as then head of the government, but he did not respond. 
  A members of the commission, Hari Har Birahi told the journalists that the report recommended for action against all members of then council of ministers, administrators among others. 
  King Gyanendra was the chair of the then council of ministers.
  Birahi quoted Prime Minister Koirala as saying that the government would implement the report as soon as possible.
  Meanwhile, two members of the commission- Ram Kumar Shrestha and Dr. Kiran Shrestha- who had refused to sign the final report expressing dissatisfaction over it, said they had submitted a separate report to the PM.
  According to reports, they were dissatisfied over the commission's recommendation, particularly in relation with the action against the King and other top officials. 
  They accused the majority members of trying to protect the King from facing tough action, despite of finding him guilty. 
  In the April movement 19 persons were killed and over 5,000 injured.

"7311",20118372,"Title: Border strife in Afghanistan shows wider tensions.rtf; Date: July 4, 2011 Monday; Text: SIRKANAY, July 4 -- On a mountain trail toward the border with Pakistan, the explosions became louder, more constant and finally visible as puffs of smoke on distant peaks and rising from valleys.
Families escaping the fusillade led donkeys strapped with mattresses and bags of clothes the other way, down the steep footpaths. They passed crippled trees, cratered houses, empty villages. Some of the villagers had shrapnel scars and described seeing relatives blown apart during a five-week artillery barrage from Pakistan.
""My grandson was nine years old,"" said Juma Gul, a 60-year-old village elder in the Sirkanay district in eastern Afghanistan. ""He and three other children were herding our goats when a rocket came. All four were killed. We could not find most of their bodies.""
A loud crack sounded and rolled over the peaks. Gul swept his hand toward the mountain range rising toward Pakistan. ""Still the rockets are landing here,"" he said.
The shelling in Kunar province is taking place along one of the most strategically important fronts of the war - a haven for hardcore insurgent groups fighting in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan has been so stung by insurgents' recent cross-border attacks, they launched an offensive that also highlights NATO's struggles to pacify the area and the lack of cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan against their common foes.
NATO officials, in fact, say they were unaware of the extent of Pakistan's artillery barrage across Afghanistan's border until last week because Western troops have been pulled back from more remote outposts in Kunar.
Afghan government officials have accused Pakistan of launching more than 761 rockets over the border into Kunar province since May and causing the deaths of at least 40 people and injuring 51. Pakistan has denied hitting Afghanistan intentionally, but acknowledged its military has been targeting Islamic militants to halt cross-border raids and that some rockets may have strayed off course.
Last month, President Hamid Karzai complained about the shelling to the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zadari.
Since those meetings, however, the assaults appear to have intensified in Kunar, about 125 miles (205 kilometers) east of Kabul.
During a two-hour visit to three mountain villages, an Associated Press reporter witnessed at least 50 artillery strikes. One rocket struck a mountain slope about five miles outside of the provincial capital, Asadabad.
The bombings have reopened old wounds along the Durand Line, the disputed 19th century demarcation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both countries claim rugged Pashtun tribal areas on either side of the poorly marked border - which is now the sanctuary for some of the fiercest insurgent groups in Central Asia. The Afghan- and Pakistan-based wings of the Taliban, Hizb-i-Islami, and more international faction such as al-Qaida and Lashkar-e-Taiba also have bases there.
Coalition officials acknowledged that recent tensions along Kunar's border has festered for weeks without an adequate response from the international alliance, in part because they consolidated troops from scattered valley and border outposts to centralized bases after coming under relentless attacks from militants.
The redeployment reflects a tactical shift from counterinsurgency operations - emphasizing development projects and regular contacts to win over local populations - to counterterrorism operations that emphasize killing militants.
Last week, U.S. forces launched an offensive in Watapoor district in central Kunar province, said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Chad Carroll, a spokesman for the 1st Calvary Division at Regional Command East. Carroll said the objective of the operation was less to take strategic terrain than to target insurgents.
""It's more about enemy locations than it is about a spot on the ground,"" he said. U.S. soldiers have killed 80 to 100 militants in the district, Carroll said.
But Taliban fighters still manage to stage attacks on both sides of Kunar's border, Afghan officials say.
""There are only finite resources, manpower,"" said British Maj. Tim James, a NATO spokesman.
""The shelling has routinely gone on where we don't have troops,"" he said.
A study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published in June says ""the reorganization of U.S. forces in Kunar and Nuristan has led to an insurgent advance.""
""The fact is, the force was too dispersed, and local opposition - the population was allied with the insurgents - led the American command to evacuate the most isolated valleys ... as well as certain border outposts,"" wrote Carnegie visiting scholar Gilles Dorronsoro.
The fighting then shifted to areas where U.S. forces evacuated and now ""is intensifying throughout the rest of Kunar,"" Dorronsoro added.
The situation along Kunar's border suggests the kind of future challenges Afghanistan, Pakista"

 Kathmandu, 13 September: Police today apprehended nearly two dozen protesters of the Miss Nepal pageant. One woman was injured in the skirmish between the police and the demonstrating women affiliated to the leftist group Unity Centre-Masal.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 14 Sep 03
Those arrested by the police included Surya Thapa, president of the women's wing of the Unity Centre and its general secretary, Anjana Bisankhe, among others. The injured has been identified as Tara Neupane. She is receiving treatment at the Kantipur Hospital.
 The demonstrating women, who alleged that the pageant is an attempt to commodify women, tore apart banners of the event.
 When informed about the protests outside the venue, a plainly shaken Miss Nepal 2003, Priti Sitaula, expressed concern. However, when asked if the protesters' charges that the whole pageant was merely an advertising gimmick and a forum to degrade women were true, the beauty queen vehemently denied the charges, stating: ""In the past, women were confined to their homes and unable to study or work. We are protesting to break those ossified traditions, and therefore I totally disagree with them.""

"5766",20071951,"Title: Helicopters drop food to 2 million stranded Indians; 229 dead in north India , Bangladesh(2).rtf; Date: August 5, 2007 Sunday 12:17 AM GMT; Text: Helicopters dropped food to almost 2 million marooned Indian villagers on Saturday as the death toll from unusually heavy monsoon rains and floods in South Asia rose to more than 225.
The food drops to 2,200 villages cut off by flooding aimed to help desperate residents in the worst-hit eastern parts of India's Uttar Pradesh state. Umesh Sinha, the state relief commissioner, also said nearly 280,000 acres of rice paddy crops had been destroyed.
In India's northeastern Assam state, flooding forced rhinos from their habitat at the Kaziranga National Park and their panicked charges killed one person and injured two others, wildlife officials said.
At least 229 people have been killed in India and neighboring Bangladesh, and 19 million driven from their homes in recent days. The South Asian monsoon season runs from June to September as the rains work their way across the subcontinent, a deluge that scatters floods and landslides across the region and kills hundreds of people every year.
The number of dead in Bangladesh rose to 81 Saturday, up from 65 a day earlier, the country's information ministry said. Raging floodwaters have battered 38 out of 64 districts in the delta nation of 145 million people.
Fakhruddin Ahmed, head of Bangladesh's military-backed interim government, visited the northwestern district of Sirajganj on Saturday. Despite the devastation, he said the government had enough food and medicine to distribute and foreign assistance wasn't yet needed.
One person looking for that help was 45-year-old Aleya Begum, who took shelter on an embankment with more than 50 other families after their homes washed away in Pabna, 75 miles north of the capital, Dhaka.
She said the group was short of drinking water.
""I've lost everything. We need help from the government to survive,"" Begum said.
Low-lying areas around Dhaka were under neck-deep water, and many residents were using boats to travel around. Government meteorologists said water levels in Dhaka continued to rise.
Flooded rivers started to recede Saturday in the Indian state of Assam but there was no such respite in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states.
Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh's top elected official, said India and neighboring Nepal had signed a treaty in 1996 to solve the annual flooding by building dams and hydropower projects, but the projects have not yet begun.
""The federal government has turned a blind eye to the recurring floods in the state,"" said Mayawati, who uses one name.
In Uttar Pradesh, flooding deaths came in all shapes and sizes: Two villagers were killed when a house collapsed, two children were swept away by floodwaters, and one person was killed by a snake bite.
With hundreds of farming villages submerged along the southern edge of the Himalayas, people took refuge wherever they could. Women and children were spotted screaming for help as they perched in treetops in Uttar Pradesh.
So far this year, some 14 million people in India and 5 million in Bangladesh have been displaced by flooding, according to government figures.
Associated Press reporters Julhas Alam and Farid Hossain in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Wasbir Hussain in Gauhati contributed to this report.

"1790",20044018,"Title: A Haitian Village Gets a Barrage of Care.rtf; Date: May 31, 2004 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final
The awful truth is that life in this ruined patch of Haiti may be better now than it has ever been, or will ever be again.
 Doctors and nurses treated the sick and wounded on Sunday in a shack that passed for a clinic. Hulking American helicopters delivered tons of food. People with money and power -- aid workers and American soldiers -- attended to Mapou.
 For the first time, and perhaps the last, someone strong is looking after the people of Mapou and its outlying hamlets. The people here lost as many as 1,670 of their friends, neighbors and relatives in the floods that have destroyed swaths of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to one Red Cross official in Mapou on Sunday, Erich Baumann.
 The 1,900 American soldiers in Haiti -- and their helicopters, now Mapou's lifeline -- will start leaving the country on Tuesday. They will all be gone in a month.
 About 1,500 of them are marines based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. More than 1,000 of them were scheduled to go to Iraq in August. Some may take a bit more time to rest, retool and retrain, but almost all will head to Baghdad and beyond by year's end.
 The Haitian government has about $3 per person to help the estimated 75,000 people affected by the flood. With so little money to aid Mapou's survivors, the government may force them to move. Many of the survivors say they might as well leave forever.
 ''This land is cursed,'' said Lilie Jean-Baptiste, 26, who like most of her neighbors had willed a living out of the earth, growing a little cassava, buying rice and beans when she scraped a dollar or two together. ''Mapou is over.''
 Marcberth St.-Louis, 21, is the son of dirt farmers who dreamed of a better life abroad someday. Mr. St.-Louis, who speaks fluent French, Creole, Spanish and a little English, said: ''For many people here, life is finished. People loved their little piece of land but it's all gone now.''
 Raymond Delaba, 15, a survivor of the torrent that took Mapou and now the sole support for his six younger brothers and sisters, said: ''It's just impossible to survive here, with or without the flood. My parents are gone. My house is gone. Our pigs and goats are gone. How am I going to survive? Are we going to eat a handful of rice out of a bag from abroad for the rest of our lives?''
 This is what life was like before the flood in Mapou and its six surrounding hamlets -- one of which, Barrois, was completely destroyed:
 As in most of Haiti's villages, the average income here is a dollar a day or less. Last year, a drought shriveled the corn. For Christmas, fate gave Mapou a flash flood. During and after the February revolt that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the price of rice -- the staff of life for Haitians -- rose 50 percent in Mapou. That meant 50 percent less to eat, Mapou's survivors said.
 No leader of Haiti has ever visited Mapou, the people said. ''For the poor, there is no government,'' Ms. Jean-Baptiste said. ''The only government of Haiti is God.''
 Now, starting June 1, a coalition of foreign soldiers cobbled together by the United Nations will begin to replace the American-led force that occupied Haiti after the fall of Mr. Aristide, who flew to exile in South Africa on Sunday.
 It is unclear that this force will have the organization, money or equipment to deal with the emergencies of food, medicine and shelter facing survivors of the flood, who will need help for months to come.
 The force is supposed to include soldiers from Brazil, China, France, Argentina, Nepal, Bangladesh, Uruguay and the Philippines. But it remains largely a force on paper, though a ceremony beginning the transfer is to take place on Tuesday and the new United Nations force is set to assume command on June 20.
 The question is what happens to the people of Mapou when the world's fleeting attention -- and the American soldiers -- move on.
 The same might be asked of the people of nearby Fond Verrettes, where the dead and missing now number close to 200, and Jimani, just over the border in the Dominican Republic, where more than 700 are dead or missing. No one has counted the dead in two small floodstruck Haitian towns, Nan Galet and Boulou, but unofficially the toll in both nations is now well over 2,000.
 The United Nations is already running more than a few major operations in places like Liberia, where thousands of peacekeepers patrol a devastated country. The world's aid agencies are struggling to handle a world of crises, many man-made, in places like Afghanistan. The charitable responses of the world's governments to Haiti have been far less than the United Nations sought.
 So the withdrawal of American forces will not help Haiti cope with its latest disaster.
 The American military began arriving Feb. 29, the day President Aristide fell, as the capital, Port-au-Prince, was stormed by armed rebels calling for a return of the notorious Haitian Army he ha"
"5876",20073635,"Title: Thousands of Maoists surround Nepal parliament.rtf; Date: May 13, 2007 Sunday 5:12 PM GMT; Text: Thousands of Maoist supporters surrounded Nepal's parliament building Sunday to demand the government abolish the monarchy and declare a republic, threatening more such protests this month.
Traffic came to a standstill in the capital as the former rebels encircled Singha Durbar, which houses the prime minister's office, parliament and key ministries, for an hour.
""We have organised this programme to pressure the government, parliament and party leaders to oust the king and go for a republic immediately and declare a date for the constituent assembly polls,"" Barsha Man Pun, a Maoist commander, said as he handed a petition to Speaker Subash Nemwang.
The Maoists launched a campaign last week calling for an end to the monarchy and said they had collected 1.5 million signatures in support.
Meanwhile, Maoist lawmakers on Sunday said they were pushing for parliament to declare a republic.
""As the poll seems to be delayed, we have registered a proposal in parliament to oust the king and declare the country a republic as per the people's aspirations,"" Dinanath Sharma, chief whip of Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) in parliament, told AFP.
Sharma charged that some royalist forces were conspiring to delay the elections and maintain the ceremonial form of the monarchy. 
The embattled monarchy's future is supposed to be decided in constituent assembly elections scheduled for June, but Nepal's top election official has said more time was needed to prepare for the poll.
Leaders of political parties and Maoists have, however, failed to come up with a new date for polls, dealing a setback to efforts to move forward the country's political process.
The delay has seen the former rebels step up demands for a republic, even though the king has already been stripped of most of his powers, including his title as head of state.
Earlier this month Maoist leader Prachanda threatened to push the nation back into turmoil by launching huge nationwide protests from late May if their demands for a republic were not met.
The Maoists, who have been granted five cabinet posts in a new interim government, have had their army and weapons confined to UN-monitored camps.
The Maoists and government signed a landmark peace deal late last year, ending a decade of civil war that claimed at least 13,000 lives.

 A senior leader of the Muslim community has alleged that attacks on mosques in the capital, Kathmandu, and other parts of the country last Wednesday (1 September) were pre-meditated. Chairman of Kashmiri Jame Masjid, Syed Nehal Shah name as published , said the Muslim community felt that those attacks were pre-planned.

He said after looking at the nature of protests late Tuesday (31 August) at Ratnapark area, they had requested deputy prime minister, home minister and other senior officials to declare curfew from early Wednesday.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 17 April
 Kathmandu: The major political parties in the dissolved parliament have said that elections could not be held as there is no peace, civil liberties have been suspended and political leaders are in detention.
 In the context of the Election Commission starting preparations to hold municipal elections, the leaders, speaking at a meeting in Kathmandu on Saturday [16 April], claimed that elections could not be held. However, they said they would not run away from elections. ""The parties would not run away from elections, but elections are impossible in the current situation,"" most of the leaders said.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 17 Apr 05 p1
Nepali Congress [NC] central committee member of Dr Ram Sharan Mahat said that municipal elections couldn't be an issue as there are no basic human rights in the country.
 ""The previous four governments appointed by the king also talked about elections, but there was no election. So an election is not possible now,"" Dr Mahat said. ""It is not necessary to talk about something which is not possible,"" he added.
 When asked whether the NC would boycott or participate in the elections, if they ever happen, Dr Mahat said: ""The NC is a party that has fought for democracy. It will never be afraid of elections."" [passage omitted]
 Central member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] Siddhi Lal Singh said that political leaders are in detention and political activities have been restricted, so elections could not be held. [passage omitted]
 Nepali Congress (Democratic) spokesperson Dr Minendra Rijal said that the restoration of peace and democracy are the main issues so elections should not be an issue at present. He said talk about elections was nonsense and that his majesty's wish to bring peace would not be fulfilled by sidelining political parties. [passage omitted]
 Assistant General Secretary of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan said that municipal polls were a positive thing when the election process has remained disrupted, but stressed the need for political freedom and peace and security to this end.
 General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) C. P. Mainali said that his party and the United Left Front would not participate in elections now. [passage omitted]

"7345",20111110,"Title: Space shuttle Endeavour lands after its last space mission.rtf; Date: June 1, 2011 Wednesday; Text: CAPE CANAVERAL, June 1 -- The space shuttle Endeavour glided home for its final landing early Wednesday and the conclusion of the next to last mission of the 30-year-old US shuttle program.
Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts - five Americans and one Italian - made a nighttime touchdown at Florida's Kennedy Space Center at 2:35 am (0635 GMT), the US space agency NASA said.
""It is sad to see her land for the last time but she really has a great legacy,"" shuttle commander Mark Kelly said, moments after landing the youngest ship in the US fleet, ending its 25th journey to space.
The astronauts just finished STS-134, a 16-day mission to the International Space Station, where they installed a $2 billion physics experiment to probe the origins of the universe and conducted four spacewalks.
""What a great ending to this really wonderful mission,"" NASA associate administrator Bill Gerstenmaier told reporters after the landing.
""They're getting great data from their instrument on board the space station. It couldn't have gone any better for this mission.""
The final flight by US shuttle Atlantis is set for July 8, and NASA sent the shuttle from the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center out to the launch pad one last time on Tuesday at 8:00 pm (0000 GMT).
The event marked a major milestone toward the end of a three-decade program of human space flight and exploration, and it drew thousands of camera-toting employees and media.
After the US shuttle era, the world's astronauts will rely on Russia's space capsules for transit to the orbiting lab at a cost of $51 million per seat until a new US crew vehicle can be built by private enterprise.
NASA has said that a shuttle replacement could emerge sometime between 2015 and 2021.
""There is going to be a period of time when Americans aren't flying on US spacecraft, so that's a challenge,"" Kelly, 47, told US media in a broadcast from space on Tuesday, the last day of Endeavour's mission.
""People leave, you know, engineers and operations people will move on and do other things, so it is the corporate memory that I think I am most worried about,"" he said.
""But over time, we will get the right mix of people. NASA has an incredible workforce, it is very talented and you know, from the late 1950s to today we have taken on great challenges and we have never failed.""
Kelly will be reunited with his wife, US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering after being shot through the head during a shooting spree at a January political event in Arizona.
Endeavour is the youngest of the shuttle fleet, which also includes Discovery and Atlantis. Discovery retired after returning from its final mission in March.
Two of the original fleet were destroyed by explosions in flight - Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. Fourteen astronauts were killed in the disasters.
Endeavour was commissioned in the wake of the Challenger explosion and first flew to space on May 7, 1992. It has amassed a total of 299 days in space and traveled 122.8 million miles (198 million kilometers), NASA said.
The other shuttle is Enterprise, which was a prototype that never flew in space and has long been on display in a museum outside Washington.
Endeavour's crew includes five Americans and Italian Roberto Vittori of the European Space Agency.
One of the Americans, Mike Fincke, set a new record for the most days spent in space by a US astronaut, with 382.
During nearly 11 days at the space station, the crew delivered and installed the Alpha-Magnetic Spectrometer-2, which will be left there to scour the universe for clues about dark matter and antimatter.
They also brought up a logistics carrier with spare parts and performed some maintenance and installation work during four spacewalks, the last to be carried out by an American shuttle crew.
A spacewalk is planned during the Atlantis mission in July but it will be done by the space station crew and not US shuttle astronauts.
After the final shuttle mission, the three spacecraft in the flying fleet and the prototype Enterprise will be sent to different museums across the country. Endeavour will be sent to California.

"395",20031333,"Title: One year after king's intervention, Nepal as chaotic as ever.rtf; Date: October 3, 2003 Friday; Text: A year after King Gyanendra dissolved Nepal's elected government and pledged to bring stability, the kingdom's political chaos persists, Maoist rebels have resumed attacks and new elections look distant, analysts said Friday.
The king, who is officially a constitutional monarch, dismissed prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on October 4, 2002, calling him ""incompetent"" at maintaining order in a country ravaged by a seven-year Maoist insurgency.
Gyanendra suspended early elections Deuba had called for November and appointed his own ""interim"" government until new polls are held.
""But even after a year, the king has failed to bring political stability and to announce the date for the elections,"" said analyst Bhogendra Thapali, a political science professor in Kathmandu.
""The king could neither solve the political problem nor reach an agreement with the the Maoists even after a year of his direct rule and with the firm support of the Royal Nepalese Army and the armed police,"" Thapali said.
The Maoists, who want to abolish the monarchy, reached a ceasefire with the royal-appointed government in January but ended it on August 27 after the administration refused rebel demands for a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The now-defunct peace process had been touted by the government as a key accomplishment since the king's intervention.
Meanwhile the king -- revered by traditionalists as a divine incarnation -- has faced four months of street protests in Kathmandu by Nepal's five leading mainstream parties, furious at being sidelined from power.
Analysts believe some deal must be reached with the parties if Nepal's myriad problems are to be solved.
""Unless the king first reaches an agreement with the five agitating parties, there is no question of solving the Maoist problem in the country,"" Thapali said.
The king last year replaced Deuba with staunch royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who resigned in May raising hopes for reconciliation with the parties.
But Chand's replacement, Surya Bahadur Thapa, has had no luck bringing the parties into the fold. The five-party alliance has named Madhav Kumar Nepal, the main opposition leader in the dissolved parliament, as its choice for prime minister and does not recognise Thapa's authority.
Meanwhile, social workers say the situation is bleak in Nepal's countryside, with hundreds of villagers reported to be displaced by the Maoist insurgency and development projects delayed.
Administrative posts in Nepal's 75 districts have been vacant since last year with Deuba's government failing to call a vote to fill them fearing a sweep by the then-opposition.
The royal-appointed government has tried to appoint civil servants to do the work of local political appointees but has met resistance.
""The Thapa government has done nothing except to appoint his party's corrupt activists and other unethical politicians in the local council posts without conducting local council elections,"" social worker Bhuban Kumar Kayastha said.
""Development works in the villages have been suspended for the past one and a half years,"" said Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a senior leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, one of the five anti-government parties.
""The country is facing a grave political crisis. Unless the king realises his mistakes and corrects them soon, the country may be doomed,"" he said.

"778",20031868,"Title: India plays down Chinese intrusion, but media is concerned.rtf; Date: July 28, 2003 Monday; Text: India's media has expressed alarm over an alleged intrusion by Chinese troops last month, even though the government Monday downplayed the incident.
India has officially protested to China over the alleged June 26 intrusion into Arunachal Pradesh state, but is not unduly alarmed by it or by Beijing's silence on its complaint, diplomatic sources said.
The media expressed concern, however, warning that such incidents affected a new bonhomie between the two neighbours who fought a brief war in 1962.
""What has happened is a local thing and can be handled at the battalion level and China's silence on our diplomatic protest does not really bother us too much,"" a highly-placed Indian foreign ministry official said.
""The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is not well defined and incidents of soldiers straying into each other's territory cannot be allowed to impinge on bilateral ties, which is on a very wide canvass,"" the official said.
The purported Chinese intrusion occurred on the day Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was winding up a historic six-day trip to China.
China for its part said it was Indian ""personnel"" who made the incursion into Chinese territory.
""Following investigations, the fact is that the Indian side crossed the Line of Actual Control in the eastern part of the Sino-Indian border,"" a Chinese foreign ministry statement said last week.
The Indian official said the appointment of special representatives by the two countries to resolve their dragging Sino-Indian border dispute indicated a new chapter in bilateral relationship.
""Their appointment is a big-picture development which aims at a political resolution of the issue and in this light small intrusions cannot be taken seriously, specially when there were no exchange of fire,"" the official said.
But the media was unsparing and in an editorial, the Hindustan Times daily accused Beijing of ""duplicity"".
""It goes without saying that the marginal improvement in relations as a result of Vajpayee's visit has suffered a blow because of a strangely cussed attitude on Beijing's part,"" it said.
India and China, who fought a brief but bitter war in 1962, are yet to demarcate their regions with an established border and instead they bank on the post-conflict LAC to identify their respective territories.
China has never recognized the 1914 boundary, known as the McMahon Line, and claims 90,000 square kilometers (34,750 square miles) -- nearly all -- of Arunachal Pradesh.
Indian and Chinese officials have met 15 times in as many years to demarcate their frontier without a resolution, although the two countries are now due to hold talks at a senior level on the border dispute.
The paper said that while New Delhi had been accommodating about Beijing's concerns about Tibet, China had not reciprocated in kind vis a vis India's concerns over Sikkim, a tiny province sandwiched between Bhutan, China and Nepal.
""The Chinese have to be told in unambiguous terms that friendship is not a one-way street,"" it said.
An editorial in the Pioneer newspaper said last months's incident once again underlined the need to demarcate the border.
""New Delhi and Beijing must maintain the utmost vigilance to ensure that nothing happens to vitiate relations … which stand to gain immensely from close mutual cooperation in economic and other areas,"" it said.

Narayan Singh Pun, the key government figure in the peace push, spoke to the cabinet a day after meeting in Kathmandu with Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a top member of the Maoists' self-styled politburo and the rebels' designated negotiator.
The two held the informal meeting to discuss a potential memorandum of understanding formalizing the January 29 ceasefire which would be signed ahead of negotiations.
Mahara told Pun, who is also minister for physical planning and works, that the Maoists wanted the release of the more than 3,500 rebel supporters estimated to be in Nepal's jails or police custody.
The guerrilla leader also called for soldiers to return to their barracks as a goodwill gesture before talks to end the seven-year insurgency which has claimed some 7,800 lives.
Pun, in turn, said Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's government wanted the Maoists to release some 180 people they detain, many of them teachers or local journalists accused of being ""counter-revolutionary"".
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Pun defended the slow start to peace talks, saying the two sides wanted to ensure negotiations were ""result-oriented"".
The last truce collapsed after four months in November 2001 when the government refused to consider Maoist demands to end the constitutional monarchy.
Former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who is opposed to Chand's government, said this week after talks with the Maoist leadership that the rebels no longer seemed to reject a role for the monarchy.
Government sources say the Kathmandu leadership is waiting for a report from an expert committee that includes the former heads of the army and police before starting the talks with the Maoists.

Kathmandu: Home Minster Krishna Prasad Sitaula has said that the United Nations will be asked to monitor only after the weapons of the state and the Maoists are managed.
Minister Situala told the House of Representatives State Affairs Committee meeting Friday [30 June] that a letter seeking UN monitoring will be sent soon.
Minister Sitaula, who is also the coordinator of the government talks team, said the Maoists and the government are moving cautiously in order to make the talks a success. Claiming that in recent days the anti-democracy power-centre has been stepping up criminal activities to disrupt the government-Maoist talks, Minister Sitaula said the government was capable of controlling such activities.
He admitted that the Maoists had been violating agreements [with the seven parties] and the code of conduct, and said that the monitoring committee would be activated to ensure the implementation of the code of conduct.
At the meeting MPs said criminal activities were on the rise due to the government's  inability to take back the weapons given by previous governments to vigilante [anti-Maoist] groups, and that the Maoists had been violating the code of conduct through extortion, among other things, because the government had failed to control them.
At the meeting Pashupati Shumser Rana [president of the royalist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party] and Purna Bahadur Khadka [former home minster] suggested that the country should back constituent assembly polls only after weapons had been managed. [passage omitted: other MPs also gave suggestions]

New Delhi,StartDateStartDate 25 April: India's CPI (M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader Sitaram Yechury, mediating between Nepal's Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) and Maoists to bring them on a common platform in the post-takeover emerging political scenario, Tuesday [25 April] said the Left extremists were still open to joining the democratic mainstream once the process of electing a constituent assembly begins.
Yechury told PTI from Calicut that while the left-wing rebels would continue with blockades and demonstration peacefully, they would wait for the restored parliament to start the process for electing a constituent assembly.
Yechury said he had been in touch with Maoist leadership overnight Monday since the king offered to reinstate parliament.
The CPI (M) leader said Nepalese parliament, now restored, should meet and take speedy decision to start the election process and formal talks with the Maoists, as agreed between the rebels and the alliance.
""Once these formal negotiations begin, the Maoists would take steps to join the democratic mainstream,"" he said.
Yechury said the Maoists told him they were concerned that Nepal's fight for democracy had on earlier occasions been ""subverted by the monarchy with the help of some political elements"".
A report from Kathmandu said Maoist leader Prachanda asked the people to continue their protests, while rejecting the king's latest offer for failing to address their key demand for a republic and elections to a constituent assembly that could water down the monarch's sweeping powers.

 In one attack a land mine planted by rebels of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) exploded under a passenger bus in Dang district, about 350 kilometers southwest of the capital.
'Two army soldiers and the driver of the bus were killed, while 20 others were injured,' one official said.
 Nine of the injured were said to be in critical condition and were airlifted to Kathmandu.
 The rebels also set off a land mine on the border of Dang and Kapilvastu districts, killing two police officers and wounding another two, said reports reaching here from the districts.
 The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, are fighting to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist republic.
 The drawn-out campaign, which began in February 1996, has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people, according to the government.

Military planes and ground forces attacked far-flung rebel positions in the Maoist-dominated west and far northeast after dropping leaflets warning villagers to stay indoors, the official said.
""We have launched air and ground operations to crush the Maoists,"" the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.
He did not say how many troops were involved in the drive to flush out the rebels or whether there had been any military casualties. But he said five alleged guerrillas were killed ""in action"" in raids in the far west.
The rebels have been waging an increasingly deadly battle to topple the constitutional monarchy and install a communist republic. The uprising, launched in 1996, has so far claimed nearly 10,000 lives.
The Royal Nepalese Army launched the offensive after the rebels said they would seek to blockade Kathmandu and stop food and other goods from reaching the capital indefinitely from next week unless the government bows to their demands.
Those demands including punishment of army officials who allegedly violated human rights by killing Maoist activists, freedom for jailed comrades and information about missing guerrillas.
The rebels, who model themselves on Peru's Shining Path guerrillas, have told vehicles to stay off roads leading to the capital of the poverty-hit Himalayan nation from next Wednesday.
""Apart from encircling the capital, the Maoists are planning to attack in the far western and far eastern Nepal district over the next three months, and the army is getting fully prepared to crush them,"" the army official said.
Since the collapse of peace talks with the government last year, the Maoists have sought to blockade towns and villages, attacking vehicles and drivers who disobeyed their orders.
They have also sought to enforce numerous general strikes in the capital and rural areas, many of which observers say have been heeded as much out of fear of the rebels as support for their cause.
The Maoists control vast areas of countryside and also have a presence in Kathmandu.
The government has said it is ""prepared to go to any length"" to revive peace talks to end the increasingly bloody insurrection.

 The chief protocol officer, Sk Md Monirul Islam, at a meeting briefed the senior officials of the member nations on the preparedness, security, protocol and media arrangements for the summit.

 They will report back to their respective governments on the situation, on which the next course of action of the governments would depend. The refusal of the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to attend the summit on security grounds partially caused the second-time postponement in February.
 The six-member Indian team, headed by the director special protection group, BV Wanchoo, and the two-member Maldivian team, headed by Abdullah Hamid, are likely to visit the venue of the summit, hotels, motels and other facility arrangements for the SAARC dignitaries during the summit. The foreign ministry officials said the representatives of the SAARC members were happy about the government preparedness for the summit.
 ""We discussed in details the protocol, security and media arrangements for the summit. The representatives of the member nations expressed their satisfaction about all the aspects of the preparedness,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Zaharul Haq after the review meeting.

    At the press conference organized at the end of Thursday's  summit talks and which has now been postponed till Oct. 15,  Sitaula said that talks have ended on a constructive note and the  participants are all moving ahead for an ""overall and significant  conclusion"". 
    The whole week gov't- guerrilla deliberation has culminated in  the SPA agreeing to decide the fate of the monarchy through  referendum and the guerrillas agreeing to separate their weapons  once they are placed in cantonment under United Nations (UN)  supervision. 
    Earlier this week, the SPA and the guerrilla outfit had agreed  to hold an election to a Constituent Assembly by the second week  of June, 2007.
    The Constituent Assembly is an elected body, like parliament,  of elected people's representatives to formulate the new  constitution.
    However, the guerrilla's top leader Prachanda asked the SPA  leaders to provide him till Oct. 15, the date scheduled for the  next talks, to get the agreement thus far to be endorsed by his  party.
    But at the same time he made it a point in saying that Thursday 's summit talks was ""qualitatively quite significant"" compared to  Sunday's and Tuesday's talks. 
    Talking to Kantipur Television, a popular news and  entertainment private channel in Nepal, Thursday evening,  Prachanda said, ""There have been positive discussions on all  issues including status of monarchy, arms management, Constituent  Assembly and interim arrangement. The two days of interactions  would lead us to concrete conclusions on Sunday."" 
     ""We are ready to lock up our arms under UN supervision if the  SPA unanimously agree to go for a republic,"" he said.
    But it seems the government as well as guerrilla talks  coordinators need more time to resolve all contentious issues in a single package, as the major contentious issues continue to remain the management of arms, interim arrangement and status of monarchy.
    Observers are saying that they won't be surprised if the next  talks scheduled for Oct. 15 fails to resolve all the thorny issues and the summit talks gets postponed again.

With Europe moving slowly to provide troops for an international monitoring force, Israel said it would act on its own to enforce the truce's arms embargo on the Lebanese guerrilla group.
In Saturday's raid, Israeli commandos struck near the Hezbollah stronghold of Baalbek, deep inside Lebanon and far from the Israeli border, in a mission the army said was aimed at halting arms shipments.
Lebanon's prime minister, Fuad Saniora, accused Israel of violating the cease-fire and said he would take the issue up with the United Nations. But Israeli officials rejected the criticism, saying the operation was in line with the truce's ban on the sales and supplies of arms to Hezbollah.
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said such incursions may continue until the Lebanese army and an expanded U.N. peacekeeping force laid out in the truce is in control of the Syrian border to enforce the arms ban.
""In the interim, of course, we can't have a situation where endless amounts of weaponry arrive for Hezbollah, so we are forced to act in response to this violation,"" he said. ""Had there been that presence there already, the Israeli operation would have been superfluous.""
In a boost for Israel, the U.S. declined to criticize the Israeli campaign, noting the U.N. resolution's arms ban on Hezbollah.
""The incident underscores the importance of quickly deploying the enhanced UNIFIL,"" White House spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo said, referring to the U.N. monitoring force.
Last week's U.N. cease-fire resolution authorized up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers to help the Lebanese army extend its authority to south Lebanon, which has been controlled by Hezbollah. The United Nations wants 3,500 troops on the ground by Aug. 28, and the entire force in place in three months.
But European nations, expected to lead the multinational force, have been hesitant about committing troops, apparently because of questions about whether the force will be called on to disarm Hezbollah fighters. The Lebanese government already has said it does not plan on disarming the guerrilla group.
France, which commands UNIFIL's current 2,000-strong force, had been expected to make a significant new contribution that would form the backbone of the expanded force.
But French President Jacques Chirac disappointed the United Nations and others by announcing Thursday that France would add just 200 combat engineers to its current 200-member contingent in Lebanon. Some 50 French troops landed in Lebanon on Saturday, the first reinforcements.
Other European nations have offered even less. Only Italy and Finland have promised troops, but Italy has not committed to specific numbers and Finland's 250-member contingent will arrive only in November. Spain and Bulgaria are considering sending troops, while Austria, the Czech Republic and Switzerland have made no offer at all.
At a meeting this week of 49 potential contributing nations, the only countries to offer mechanized infantry battalions, which will be the front line of the expanded force, were three Muslim countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia and Nepal, which is predominantly Hindu.
Many countries said they wanted to study the operational plans for the force and the rules of engagement before making any decisions. They include several European countries, U.N. diplomats said.
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown stressed that more European nations would be needed to balance commitments from Muslim countries so that Israel and Lebanon will view the troops as legitimate.
Cristina Gallach, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, dismissed suggestions that the failure of European nations to send troops could have triggered the Israeli raid.
""Nobody expected the deployment to be this week anyway,"" she said in a telephone interview. She noted that although the United Nations is working very hard to find units for UNIFIL, most candidate countries had to get parliamentary approval for their troops to be sent overseas.
""It's therefore logical that they want to know the details of the mandate, the rules of engagement, and how the military can apply these,"" Gallach said.

 The foreign minister, Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk, said the report contains factual inaccuracies and makes baseless allegations that the attack was provoked by the Bhutanese terms and conditions and calls on the royal government to relax its terms and conditions further.
 Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuck said there are clear agreements and understandings between the governments to respect each other's terms and conditions.
 Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said the members of the BVT, on reading the report, expressed dismay at the callous manner in which a serious incident had been lightly treated by the Nepalese government.
 The members of the BVT noted the lack of proper security, the poor meeting arrangements and the aggressive manner in which the members of the Nepalese verification team conducted themselves on the day contributed to the beating and humiliation of the Bhutanese officials.
 Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said despite severe shortcomings and inaccuracies of the report, the royal government of Bhutan indicated to the Nepalese government that in the interest of moving the bilateral process forward, the royal government could consider the report positively if Nepal deleted the unacceptable reference to relaxation of Bhutan's terms and conditions.
 The Nepalese foreign minister had conveyed that he appreciated and understood Bhutan's views but would have to consult his cabinet to get a fresh report sent.
 With the change of government in Nepal, Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said the fluid political and security situation in Nepal continues to be a source of serious concern.
 The foreign minister, Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk, appraised the house that a Bhutan Gorkha Liberation Front and a Bhutan Communist Party have been formed.
 Lyonpo said that the Bhutan Communist Party has links to the Maoists in Nepal. The Maoists are recruiting people in the camps and that some of them had even participated in Maoists' attacks in Nepal. The Nepalese authorities have arrested a number of them for joining the Maoists, while others have absconded from the camps.
 Concluding his submission, Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said the royal government on its part will abide by all the agreements it has reached with the government in Nepal to find a lasting and durable solution to the issue of the people in the camps in Nepal.
 Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said this includes the commitment to take back all those people in the camp who have been found to be genuine Bhutanese refugees.

Text of press release by Paris-based organization Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) on 9 January
Reporters Without Borders voiced outrage today at the continuing harassment of the independent press by the security forces in both Kathmandu and the districts, in which at least six journalists have been detained, attacked or threatened since 1 January 2006.
""The security forces stop at nothing to monitor and silence journalists working for the independent press,"" Reporters Without Borders said. ""Arrests, threats and censorship succeed one another in an infernal cycle,"" the organization added, calling on the international community to keep stressing the importance of respecting press freedom to the Nepalese government.
Half of the cases of censorship in the world in 2005 were in Nepal, where at least 425 journalists were arrested, attacked on threatened.
The police yesterday interrogated Benupraj Bhattarai, the correspondent of the daily Kantipur in the eastern district of Ilam, about his sources for a report on a student demonstration during a visit by the king to the district in which anti-monarchic slogans were chanted and black flags were unfurled.
The day before, Hari Narayan Gautam of the daily Rajdhani was detained while covering a Communist Party of Nepal-UML meeting in the western town of Kalimati by nine soldiers who had posed as Maoist activists in order to infiltrate the meeting. He was released after being questioned for three hours. An army spokesman said there was a misunderstanding.
Reporter Bed Prakash Timilsina and photographer Shailendra Kharel of Kantipur were detained and roughed up on 5 January at the main hospital in the southwestern city of Nepalgunj while interviewing people who had been injured in a Maoist attack.
Plain-clothes police seized copies of the weekly Janadabad on 4 January in the eastern town of Sindhulimadi, where journalists were also threatened by soldiers who tried to force them to leave the district.
Moti Paudel of the daily Kantipur and Kamal Panta, a cameraman with Kantipur TV, were also detained and beaten on 2 January by plain-clothes police, who accused them of being Maoist spies. They had been covering the case of four persons who were arrested as they left a court in Surkhet which had just released them. A policeman deleted the photos in Panta's camera.

Kathmandu: Minister for Physical Planning and Construction Bijaya Kumar Gachchhadar has pointed at the danger of the country disintegrating if Maoist combatants are integrated into the Nepal Army.
Gachchhadar, parliamentary party leader of the Madhes Janadhikar Forum who is in the government led by Maoist chairman Puspa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', said that his party would project itself in a forceful fashion to forestall anything that will lead to the country's disintegration.

"4878",20066400,"Title: All the king's men dominate Nepalese polls.rtf; Date: February 9, 2006 Thursday 5:57 AM GMT; Text: Royalist candidates who dominated local elections called by Nepal's king duly cleaned up in the violence-plagued poll, according to official partial results issued Thursday.
Results were announced by the Election Commission in nearly half the 36 municipalities where polls were held on Wednesday, with candidates mainly from newly-formed pro-royal political parties winning the day.
The elections were boycotted by mainstream opposition parties and disrupted by Maoist rebels, leading to a voter turnout of just over 21 percent in the troubled Himalayan country, the commission said.
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party led by Home Minister Kamal Thapa won mayors' seats in eight municipalities, and independent candidates -- many of whom are believed to back King Gyanendra -- won seven, the commission said.
Violence marred the elections, called by the king as part of his ""roadmap"" back to democracy after he seized power a year ago.
""The average turnout was just over 21 percent,"" commission spokesman Tejmuni Bajracharya told AFP.
""This is the lowest turnout in the history of elections conducted in Nepal,"" he added, attributing the large-scale stay-away to ""the unfavourable conditions"" in the country.
Newspapers Thursday had differing assessments of the vote.
The state-run Rising Nepal lauded its ""peaceful conclusion"" while the Kathmandu Post and Himalayan Times featured front-page stories about the low turnout and poll protests.
The United States said the elections were a ""hollow attempt to legitimize power"" by Gyanendra and called on the king to restore democracy.
""The only effective way to deal with the threat posed by Maoists is to restore democracy in Nepal,"" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington late Wednesday.
""We call upon the king to release all political detainees and initiate a dialogue with the political parties.""
More than half the seats in the local polls remained empty because of a dearth of candidates, while in 22 municipalities, mayoral candidates were appointed after standing unopposed.
The low turnout is a reflection of people's distrust of the king, said political analyst and president of the Nepal Press Institute Dhruba Adhikary.
""This shows that there is a lack of trust and in this period it appears with the kind of interview Prachanda gave, they seem to be the ones who have gained some achievements,"" Adhikary said.
In an interview with India's Hindu newspaper published Wednesday, Maoist leader Prachanda said the rebels would be willing to let the monarchy survive if that was accepted by the Nepalese people.
Prachanda said he was willing to hold talks with the king if Gyanendra conceded that his army-backed coup was ""wrong"".
Gyanendra sacked the government a year ago and took total control of the Himalayan nation, saying the elected government had failed to hold elections or to stem the Maoist insurgency that has claimed 12,500 lives since 1996.
On the first anniversary of his takeover on February 1, the king reiterated his year old ""roadmap to democracy"" under which local elections would be followed by nationwide elections before April 2007.
""The king said that by April 2007 all representative institutions will be reactivated,"" Adhikary said.
""But we have more than 4,000 villages that have to have their elections, and we don't have a national parliament. Priority should have been given to national elections, then rural, then municipal.""
Nepal's rebel Maoists had called a week-long general strike from Sunday to try to disrupt the polls, but they called off the action late Wednesday, claiming that their efforts to thwart the polls had been successful.
Opposition parties and the Maoists entered a loose alliance against the monarchy last year, which holds despite the deaths of more over 140 people since the rebels ended a unilateral ceasefire in early January.

A rebel statement said individual Maoists attacked the tankers in a Nepalese border district out of anger at the arrest last week in India of senior guerrilla Mohan Baidya.
""A section of Maoist activists acted out of anger at his arrest,"" said the statement signed by Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara.
""But let us not sensationalise events. It is not our policy to cause harm to Indian interests or nationals.""
The Indian government had said it held the Maoist leadership responsible for the attack Saturday on the tankers, which were empty.
""This is a blatant act of terrorism and its perpetrators must be apprehended and punished for their crimes,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said Monday.
The Maoist rebels, who are fighting to overthrow Nepal's monarchy, oppose India's widespread political and economic influence in the landlocked Himalayan kingdom.
India, along with Britain and the United States, has provided financial support and military equipment to the government to tackle the insurgency, which has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.

 'Sending troops is not an option open to India,' Indian Ambassador to Nepal Shyam Saran said at a farewell meeting with Nepalese and foreign reporters here.
'We have been helping and will continue help Nepal in many other different ways to battle the insurgency,' said the Indian envoy, who will from Aug. 1 assume the post of secretary at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.
 India would like to help Nepal grapple with the Maoist rebel insurgency by 'strengthening the capability of your military forces,' the envoy added.
 India is assisting Nepal by providing military hardware, including attack helicopters, and training to Royal Nepalese Army, and the two countries have recently stepped up cooperation in exchange of insurgency-related intelligence information.
 'We are ready to give more,' he said.
 India, which in Nepal is sometimes charged with harboring Maoist rebel leaders in its territory, considers the violence to be an 'illegitimate' means of achieving the rebels' political goals, Saran said.
 The envoy mentioned the 1,445-kilometer open border between Nepal and India and said 'Nepal's Maoists are also a security problem to India.'
 The rebels took up arms against Nepalese government in 1996 to replace monarchy with a communist republic. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the nine years of fighting.
 India sent troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce a peace accord, but the troops ended up fighting the Tamil separatist guerrillas, who accused them of siding with the Sri Lankan government. The troops were withdrawn in 1990 after the death of nearly 1,200 soldiers.

""The internally displaced people in Nepal are largely overlooked and neglected. They are in need for protection and assistance,"" said Walter Kalin, a representative of the U.N. secretary-general on the human rights of internally displaced persons.
The government says only 8,000 people have been displaced by the war ,but independent agencies say hundreds of thousands have fled their homes due to violence and threats by the Maoist rebels.
The rebels are accused of forced conscription, extortion and reprisal attacks against suspected government sympathizers, often beating and killing them.
In response, some Nepalese have taken up arms to retaliate against the rebels, reportedly with the government's encouragement.
Last month, villagers killed about 31 rebels in Kapilbastu district, 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Katmandu. The rebels retaliated, killing 15 villagers and forcing the government to open an army camp to control the situation.
Kalin called on vigilante groups to stop the attacks.
""Taking law in their own hands is not the solution,"" said Kalin, who led a 10-day U.N. fact-finding mission to Nepal.
Later Friday a special adviser to the U.N.'s humanitarian chief told reporters at the U.N. headquarters in New York that displaced people receive no help.
Dennis McNamara, who advises Jan Egeland on internal displacement and has recently returned from a visit to Nepal, said: ""There is no systematic assistance or protection given to these displaced populations either by the authorities of Nepal or international organizations.""
He added: ""Any assistance they get is ad hoc and it is quite inadequate.""
The guerrillas, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting to overthrow Nepal's monarchy and establish a communist state in 1996. More than 11,500 people have been killed in the insurgency.
The rebels have stepped up attacks in the past few weeks to protest King Gyanendra taking absolute power in February. Human rights groups have expressed alarm over the power grab, saying it would worsen the country's already deteriorating human rights situation.

The April 10 polls are the culmination of a 2006 peace deal between former rebel Maoists and the government, and are being held to elect a body that will abolish the world's last Hindu monarchy and rewrite the country's constitution.
""The next few days are a very sensitive period. Even a small mistake can make a big difference,"" the 84-year-old premier told reporters after meeting with the election commission.
""The need of the hour is to show greater patience as we are on the threshold of bringing a landmark change,"" he said.
Nepali media has been reporting daily clashes between supporters of the former rebel Maoists and the country's two largest parties -- the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
""The violence, including killings, beatings and the threatening of election candidates has occurred in several parts of the country and the trend is increasing,"" Election Commission chief Bhojraj Pokhrel said at a press conference.
""We are worried that this (continued violence and intimidation) will spoil the election environment if the parties continue such activities,"" Pokhrel said. ""It will raise the question of elections being credible and fair.""
The United Nations, which was invited to assist with the polls and monitor former Maoist guerrillas confined to camps around the country, has said that the continuing violence could derail the election.

The eight guerrillas were gunned down on the spot separately in Palpa, Bardiya, and Achham districts in western Nepal, as well as in the central district of Dhading and the eastern district of Panchthar, the press release said.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fire with the government security forces. The government forces also seized some arms, ammunition and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations, the press release added.
The anti-government insurgency has claimed over 7,000 lives, including guerrillas, security forces personnel and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
The insurgents have stepped up their violent activities across the country since the nine-month-long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August last year.

    Their demands include security guarantee to all civil servants  and teachers, martyr's status to VDC secretary Ram Hari Pokharel,  senior clerk Prabhu Narayan Yadav, teacher Arun Kumar Shrestha and others who were murdered by different armed groups, severe actions against the guilty on the basis of the police reports, and peace  talks with different agitating groups.

 In their first joint statement, the two parties have also pledged themselves to a common fight until 'the cause of socialism and communism is established the world over.'
Signed by Prachanda, Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), and Ganapathy, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the statement was e-mailed to media in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.
 Both Maoist leaders use only one name.
 The two leaders also called for an end of attacks on 'the revolutionary people of Nepal' and 'the revolutionary leaders and masses of India.'
 In Nepal, Maoists, who say they derive inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, are waging a 'people's war' aimed at overthrowing the monarchy and setting up a communist republic.
 But they are also responsible for thousands of abductions and hostage takings, as well as killings and torture, according to human rights organizations.
 Nepal's bloody Maoist insurgency has claimed more than 13,000 lives since its outbreak in 1996.
 Maoists are also said to have a very strong presence in several states of neighboring India, which declared Maoists 'terrorists' in 2001.
 India has helped Nepal tackle the insurgency by providing military equipment and training, but it put on hold its military aid to Nepal following the seizure of executive power by King Gyanendra in February this year.

On the eve of the show-piece Nepal Tourism Year (NTY) -2011 which the government is commemorating with an aim to bring 1 million tourists, US Department of State warning to US citizens of the potential risks of traveling to Nepal has come as a serious spoiler.
Issuing a travel advisory on Wednesday [12 January], the Department of State said it remains concerned about the security situation in Nepal and urged US citizens to obtain updated security information before traveling and ""be prepared to change their plans on short notice"".
The latest travel advisory replaces the ""Travel Warning"" for Nepal dated 15 June 2010, ""to update information on the security and political situation, and to advise travelers about the continuing possibility of political demonstrations, unrest, and concerns about travel in Nepal by road and air.""
""Nepal has experienced significant political violence in the past and, although there have been markedly fewer major disturbances in recent months, political tensions remain. Protests, demonstrations, and disruptions continue to occur, often without advance notice,"" it said.
The travel alert further states that the US government's designation of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) as a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"" organization under Executive Order 13224, and its inclusion on the ""Terrorist Exclusion List"" pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, ""remain in effect"".
These two designations make Maoists excludable from entry into the United States without a waiver and bar US citizens from contributing funds, goods, or services to, or for the benefit of, the Maoists, it said.

Nepal.rtf; Date: January 4, 2007 Thursday 11:41 AM GMT; Text: A breakaway faction of Nepal's Maoist guerrillas has called a three-day strike next week in the southern part of Nepal to protest planned elections for a constituent assembly, local media reports said Thursday.
Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha said in a press statement issued Wednesday it will also ""disallow"" elections for the constituent assembly in the southern Terai plains region where it is based, the Nepal Samacharpatra newspaper reported.
The seven-party ruling coalition and the Maoist rebels are working to hold the elections, which form the key component of the country's current peace process, by mid-June this year.
The elected assembly will be tasked with writing a new constitution.
The Maoist rebels agreed in November 2005 to end the Himalayan nation's civil strife by electing the constituent assembly, thus initiating Nepal's current peace process.
The JTMM, which broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) less than two years ago, has vowed to disallow the constituent assembly elections in the southern plains, which it alleges has been marginalized.
In the press statement, JTMM convener Jai Krishna Goit has asked ""the Nepali rulers to leave the Terai"" and has demanded that indigenous people be allowed to run the army, police, and administration in the region.
He has urged the people of Terai ""not to fall for the conspiracy of constituent assembly elections hatched by Nepalis"" and has called on political parties, organizations, intellectuals and individuals of the Terai region to organize a roundtable conference to write a new constitution for the region.

"2172",200419,"Title: UN expresses serious concern on enforced disappearances.rtf; Date: August 27, 2004 Friday 1:00 PM EST; Text: A human rights working group of the United Nations on Friday expressed serious concern on phenomenon  of disappearances that continues to occur in scores of countries.
    The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances  (WGEID) expressed its concern in a message issued here when the  International Day of the Disappeared (Aug. 30) is approaching.  
    ""While in the past disappearances were mainly associated with  the state policies of authoritarian regimes, nowadays they occur  in the context of much more complex situations of internal  conflict generating violence, humanitarian crisis, and human  rights violations,"" said the working group.
    WGEID was established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1980 to assist the relatives of disappeared persons in  ascertaining their fate and whereabouts and to act as a channel  for communication between the families and governments concerned.
    The working group expressed particular concern over reports  received from non-governmental organizations on the situation in  countries such as Nepal, Colombia and Russia. 
    According to these reports, the fate of more than 890  disappeared persons is still unknown in Colombia, and the figures  for Nepal and Russia are 130 and 270. 
    The practice of enforced or involuntary disappearance of  persons infringes upon an entire range of human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and set out in both  International Covenants on Human Rights as well as in other major  international human rights instruments, said WGEID.
    The working group called upon all governments to take action to prevent disappearances, and in particular to end the practice of  secret detentions.
    In addition, it said, all governments must end impunity for  security forces and armed bands who perpetrate disappearances, and must make every effort to discover the fate of disappeared persons, share that information with family and friends of the disappeared, and provide compensation in the case of death.
    On the occasion of the International Day of the Disappeared,  the working group reaffirmed that the act of committing enforced  or involuntary disappearances is a crime with severe consequences, not only for victims and for relatives and friends of the victim,  but also for entire societies and for the credibility of states.

Home Secretary V.K. Duggal will hold talks with the chief secretaries of 13 insurgency-hit states on ways to stop Maoist violence from spilling into India's remaining 16 states, home ministry officials said Tuesday.
""The meeting will review the status of various policies involving intelligence-gathering, networking and coordination between the Centre and the affected states,"" a ministry official said, asking to remain unnamed.
The meeting would review to what extent the states have succeeded in strengthening police stations in vulnerable areas in terms of supplying extra manpower and modern weaponry and communications, he said.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last month ordered state governments to step up operations to tackle the Maoists, which experts say have links to leftwing guerrillas in neighbouring Nepal.
""We cannot allow them to succeed and get away with their crimes and we need to gear ourselves up to meet these challenges,"" Singh said in July.
The Maoists, who say they are fighting for the rights of neglected tribes and landless farmers, have killed more than 175 people including security officials since January in the worst-hit Indian state of Chhattisgarh.
The rebels control 10 of Chhattisgarh's 16 districts.
The guerrillas also hold sway in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa.
""We must recognise past responses are inadequate in dealing with these problems which are of a different intensity, magnitude, scale and scope,"" Singh said, branding the revolt ""probably the single biggest challenge"" facing India.
Saaji Cherian, an analyst at the Institute of Conflict Management, said there was no military solution to the left-wing militancy.
""Development must go hand-in-hand with security operations or else Maoism will gain currency among India's landless populations who live in virtual bondage,"" Cherian said.

Another 14 Guatemalans were wounded in the shootout in Garamba National Park and flown to a hospital in the regional capital, Bunia, said Kemal Saiki, a U.N. spokesman.
Saiki had no information on the attackers' identities, but said the U.N. troops were conducting an operation to sweep for Lord's Resistance Army rebels believed to be in the area.
The Ugandan rebels operate mostly from bases in southern Sudan, near the area where the borders of Congo, Uganda and Sudan intersect. But some fighters fled to eastern Congo late last year following pressure from Ugandan troops who have been permitted by Sudanese authorities to pursue them to their rear bases.
The incident was the second-worst blow to the 15,000-member peacekeeping mission since it began in 1999.
On Feb. 25, 2005, ethnic Lendu militiamen in the same region where Sunday's clash took place killed nine U.N. Bangladeshi troops in the worst single loss suffered by the world body during its Congo mission. The U.N. responded with a massive operation they said left 75 militiamen dead.
Monday's gunfight broke out around dawn and lasted for about four hours until a helicopter-borne Nepalese contingent arrived in support, said U.N. spokeswoman Jennifer Bakody by telephone from Bunia, in eastern Congo.
There was no information on casualties among the attackers.
The Lord's Resistance Army is known for abducting more than 30,000 children, forcing them to become fighters, porters or concubines. The group, which has killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 1 million to flee their homes, wants Uganda to be governed by the Ten Commandments.
Some 105 Guatemalans are serving in the U.N. force, deployed to provide security in Congo and monitor a 2002 peace deal.
Thousands of militiamen still roam the province of Ituri in northeastern Congo, where clashes between ethnic Lendu and Hema militia have killed more than 50,000 people since 1999 in a conflict that became a bloody spin-off of Congo's larger 1998-2002 war.
Garamba National Park is located in a lawless region near Congo's northeastern border with Sudan. The park is home to a handful of endangered white rhinos that have been plagued by poachers.
In separate fighting Sunday, renegade former army soldiers in Congo ambushed U.N. peacekeepers with mortars in a hilltop banana plantation, sparking a fighting that left four of the attackers dead, U.N. officials said.
The peacekeepers were conducting an operation to flush the militants out of territory they captured during a slew of raids this week near Rwindi, said U.N. military spokesman Mayank Awasthi.
Rwindi is about 90 miles north of the regional capital, Goma, near the Rwandan border.
The Ituri conflict was a bloody spin-off of Congo's larger five-year war that involved six African armies and killed nearly 4 million people, mostly through war-induced starvation and disease.
Congo's shaky transitional government is trying to shepherd peace throughout the enormous country, but the long arm of the law has been slow to reach the volatile east.
The first presidential elections in decades are expected this year in the vast nation, when Congolese will choose a new government to replace a postwar transitional administration.

"5483",20061174,"Title: Secret service.rtf; Date: August 9, 2006 Wednesday 12:23 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Aug 9 -- Ever since the Mumbai blasts, the spotlight has been on the abilities of our intelligence services. Purely coincidentally, this has become clubbed with the somewhat farcical mole-hunt set off by Jaswant Singh, and the very real breach of security in the National Security Council Secretariat. Yet a great deal of the criticism has been uninformed, sometimes bordering on the hysterical.
  The expectation that the country's secret services should somehow be better than other governmental services is unfair. No one would want disloyal personnel or traitors lurking in their ranks. But surely we cannot expect the intelligence services to be way above the norm, considering they draw their personnel from the same stock as other services in the government sector. Their organisations, tighter than the usual government department, have the same DNA in terms of work culture, problems and prospects. There are pools of excellence, dedication and selflessness in these services just as there are elsewhere. And as in all organisations, a lot has to do with history, as well as leadership.
  Actually the root of many of our problems in the area of intelligence lies much higher up - in the upper echelons of our political system. The intelligence agencies must function within the parameters of a country whose political class sees nothing extraordinary in criminals sitting in legislatures, or shrugs off infiltration from Bangladesh. This country's intelligence culture is evident from two books that appeared this year. The first, the Mitrokhin Archive spoke of high-level penetration and influence-peddling by the KGB in India. It was politely ignored. The second, by a former IB official, detailed the political shenanigans of his organisation, including juicy tidbits like how the PMO was used to bug the President of the Republic. Again, the book and the charge were coolly ignored by the entire political class.
  Another instance of how casually matters of security are treated by the politicians: In the late Eighties, when Indian forces were battling the LTTE in Sri Lanka, Tamil politicians, particularly those of the DMK, ignored the activities of the terrorist outfit which was at the time obtaining fuel and funds, and even running grenade factories in the state. Today, it's not surprising that DMK leader and Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, once again in pursuit of votes, is going out of his way to be soft not only on Islamic fundamentalists, but even those charged with terrorist crimes.
  Among the intelligence services, the Intelligence Bureau stands out in terms of reputation. In part this has to do with its inheritance a counter-intelligence culture from the British. Since the Pakistani covert assault against India got underway, the bureau's focus has shifted to anti-terrorist operations as well. Because India has refused to get into a tit-for-tat terrorist war by bombing and assassinating in Pakistan, the country's counter-terror tactics have relied on the IB's abilities to block, deflect and terminate terrorist conspiracies on Indian soil.
  This has led to the other service, the Research & Analysis Wing which deals with external intelligence, being deprived of a significant 'operations' culture. India has had a poor history in this area anyway because during colonial times, this was an exclusive British preserve. Some limited capabilities were created for operations against China in Tibet in the 1960s, but these are of little use today. This has meant atrophied abilities for covert operations in countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.
  In recent times, R&AW has got a bum rap because of allegations of foreign penetration, as in the case of Rabinder Singh and Brig Ujwal Dasgupta. R&AW's problem is that by its very charter, it is more open to penetration. Its main work lies outside the country and it is responsible for liaison with foreign intelligence agencies. This doesn't excuse what happened, but explains why it could have, and also points to the problem in need of correction. The IB, for example, has blocked some four attempts at penetration in the past decade or so.
  In the past two years, an enormous effort has been made to reform and restructure the intelligence services. Though a Group of Ministers' decisions were approved in 2003, intelligence agencies used the 2004 change of government to block reform. The process got underway only in mid-2005 because of the sudden demise of National Security Advisor J.N. Dixit.The appointment of M.K. Narayanan as his successor has led to a sharp rise in the pace of change in great measure because of his background as a highly regarded intelligence professional. This is evident from the implementation of the approved decisions on restructuring and reform, as well in the creation of newer instrumentalities.
  Premier among these is the country's new high-tech spying agency-the National Technical Research Organisation. The NTRO was cr"

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 21 November
Kathmandu, 21 November: The government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) today signed a comprehensive national peace treaty, which formally ends the decade-long insurgency in the country that claimed over 13,000 lives. 
The treaty was signed by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on behalf of the government and Maoist chairman Prachanda on behalf of the CPN-M at the BICC [Birendra International Convention Centre] . Before the signing Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula read out the entire text of the treaty in front of a packed convention hall, which included both the talks team, entire cabinet, ambassadors of various countries and the media.
The signing of the treaty also paves the way for the Maoists to join the mainstream politics and join an interim government that will oversee elections to a Constituent Assembly, which will in turn prepare a new constitution and decide the fate of over 237-year-old institution of monarchy.
The government and the Maoists needed many rounds of rigorous negotiations to reach a consensus on the draft of the treaty, which was originally scheduled to be signed on November 16 as per the historic agreement reached earlier this month.
Coincidentally, tomorrow (22 November is the first anniversary of the formation of the first ever strategic alliance between the Maoists and the seven-party alliance against the King after the King assumed absolute powers through a bloodless military coup on 1 February 2005.
At least 13,000 people lost their lives after the Maoists launched an armed rebellion what they called a people's war against the State in 1996. Thousands of families were displaced from their villages after the war began. The signing of the treaty today has also given hopes to the internally displaced people, many of whom are yet to return to their homes even though the Maoists announced ceasefire and appealed to them to return to their villages some seven months ago.
The United Nations is going to supervise the peace process in the country. The UN, in consultations with the government and Maoists, has inspected and finalized seven main camps and 21 sub-camps where the rebels' armies and arms will be kept till elections to a constituent assembly were held.
The UN mission will monitor around 35,000 Maoist soldiers and the 90,000-strong Nepali Army.

"7670",20118212,"Title: Rescuers push into Himalayan quake 'ground zero'.rtf; Date: September 19, 2011 Monday 9:02 PM GMT; Text: Rescue teams faced a grim search for victims Tuesday as they converged on the remote epicentre of a powerful Himalayan earthquake that killed at least 67 people in India, Nepal and Tibet.
After a day spent battling landslides and heavy rains, the relief effort regrouped for an even tougher push into the mountainous northern region of India's Sikkim state, where Sunday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit on the border with Nepal.
Rescuers were hoping for a break in the weather that would allow them to fly in crucial supplies and personnel by helicopters that were largely grounded Monday by monsoon downpours and low cloud.
""The biggest challenge now is to get the rescue teams to the affected areas,"" said Sikkim Information Minister C.B. Karki.
The death toll from building collapses and landslides in Sikkim stood at 35, but Indian Home Secretary R.K. Singh warned the number could rise as emergency relief workers reached far-flung villages in the quake's main impact zone.
""We cannot rule out more casualties,"" Singh told a news briefing in New Delhi.
The few helicopter sorties carried out on Monday did manage to drop some food packages, and ferried two small medical teams with doctors and paramedics into the worst-affected districts of Mangan and Sangthan.
But the majority of rescue workers faced a gruelling 60-kilometre (37-mile) journey by land from Sikkim's state capital Gangtok along rough, badly damaged roads, more often frequented by groups of adventurous tourists heading for Himalayan trekking trails.
More than 5,000 army troops were mobilised across the state to help clear roads and assist with the relief operation.
The Press Trust of India said 26 tourists, including 15 trekkers, had been rescued and taken to army encampments for their own safety.
Hundreds of Gangtok residents spent a second night out in the open, too scared to sleep in homes badly damaged by the quake, which left deep fissures in the outer walls and ceilings of apartment blocks and buildings.
Many saw out the night in the city's football stadium, slinging plastic sheets over the goalposts or sleeping on the terraces.
""The stadium is our kitchen and bedroom for the night. We're honestly just too scared to consider anything else,"" said Amrita Laqandri, 32, as she helped make tea and warm bread on stoves brought from her family home.
There was some relief as power, cut off by the quake, was restored to the city Monday evening, but landline and mobile communications remained erratic, especially in the worst-affected areas.
The quake was felt across a wide region including the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan after it struck at about 6:10 pm (1240 GMT) on Sunday, according to the US Geological Survey.
Its epicentre was 68 kilometres northwest of Gangtok, at a relatively shallow depth of 19.7 kilometres.
In Nepal, eight people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged in the east of the country, where rescuers faced the same problems as their Indian counterparts with rains and mudslides blocking the only highway.
""We have formed rescue teams in each affected district. They are assessing the damage and organising the rescue and relief operations,"" said Nepalese police spokesman Binod Singh.
Seventeen other people died in the Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, while China's official Xinhua news agency said seven people had been killed in southern Tibet, near the border with Sikkim.
India's seven northeastern states, joined to the rest of the country by a narrow sliver of land known as the ""chicken's neck,"" are located in an area of frequent seismic activity.

"2305",20044021,"Title: Modernity Tips Balance in a Remote Corner of Kashmir.rtf; Date: November 25, 2004 Thursday; Text: Late Edition - Final
The young man wore Western clothes, but he paused as he passed the prayer wheel. Then, without self-consciousness, he mounted the steps and spun, circumambulating the wheel in search of good fortune.
 ''I feel great because I'm doing something for my God,'' he said afterward.
 The young man, Tsewang Tamchos, 16, is a product of Ladakh, a remote repository of Tibetan Buddhism on a high-altitude Himalayan plateau in the northern areas of Kashmir, a disputed state. But he is a product of a wider world, too: his school in Delhi, the music of Eminem, the ambitions of an upwardly mobile family whose material fortunes improve with each generation.
 As in many cultures, the people of Ladakh, a sparsely populated region, live in the fold between tradition and modernity. But few places have provided as concentrated a laboratory for how modernization is tipping that balance.
 In less than four decades, Ladakh has gone from being closed to the outside world to reflecting it. With each generation, the ties to the land, to the past, weaken, as options and opportunities widen. The culture and economy have moved from community-oriented to competitive, from living off the land to working for cash and spending it.
 For generations, Ladakh, a barren, moonlike landscape punctuated by monasteries, was almost cut off from the outside world. No decent roads crossed the mountains. It took 16 days to get to Srinagar, the state's summer capital, across passes that soar above 13,000 feet. Its people developed a way of life attuned to the land, and in tune with one another. Nothing was wasted, wrote Helena Norberg-Hodge in her book, ''Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh.'' Human waste fertilized fields; worn-out clothes patched irrigation channels.
 But two milestones altered life here. In 1962, India and China, which Ladakh borders, fought a war. That brought in the Indian military -- the first real outsiders -- and infrastructure, merchants and more. Today, bases dot the land, and the army is the area's largest employer.
 In 1974, Ladakh opened to foreign tourists for the first time, and they quickly became a pillar of the economy.
 The influx of outsiders was not all bad, said Sonam Dawa, who runs the Ladakh Ecological Development Group. Ladakhis, with help from outsiders like Ms. Norberg-Hodge, a linguist, prevented Ladakh from becoming another Nepal, spoiled by an excess of hippies and drugs. At first ashamed by their backwardness, many Ladakhis came to believe that, if foreigners saw such value in their culture, language and dress, they should, too.
 But the influence of outsiders has gradually leeched into Ladakh's way of life. Before, Mr. Dawa noted, the economy was not based on money. Rich and poor alike needed each other for the harvest. Now rich men can hire laborers from Nepal or poorer Indian states, and many do.
 ''There is a lot of competition now,'' he said. ''Everyone is trying to have a car.''
 The notion, and the novelty, of competition surfaces in conversations in the car-choked streets of Leh or nearby villages.
 At 35, Tashi Palzes is old enough to remember a time with no competition in her village, Phyang Puluhu, which sits on several steep terraces in the valley behind the Phyang monastery.
 Today, she, like everyone, is racing against her neighbors, and sees herself as winning. She has not one, but two televisions -- the second one in color -- and a satellite dish on her roof. She wears not the handspun traditional dress of a Ladakhi woman but a secondhand Gap sweatshirt, bought at the Leh bazaar.
 Earlier, she said, villagers did not have much and did not need much. Now they have more needs -- better clothes, better education, more televisions -- and thus more work. Life is simultaneously more comfortable and more difficult. 
 Even the Buddhist monasteries of Ladakh, which is known as Little Tibet, are grappling with modernity.
 The Rizong -- literally ''mountain haven'' -- monastery, founded in 1833, sits in a narrow mountain fold with a view of the snowy Himalayas in the distance. The number of students has diminished as the economy has improved, said Chotak Lama, one of the monks, because fewer poor families need the monastery for their children. The monastic life was built around isolation, but even monks want to be connected these days. It was once a 90-minute walk from the main road to Rizong, and monks regularly made the journey with supplies on their backs. But last year, at the monks' behest, the government built a smooth road that climbs up through the mountains.
 In the Leh home of Tsewang Tamchos, too, each generation brings substantial change. His grandparents live in the Nubra Valley, about 75 miles away.
 They do not read or write; they farm. They grew up drinking unlimited quantities of butter tea, the salty staple of Ladakhi life.
 His father, Tsering Tundup, 44, is a government forester. He says butter tea is bad for his blood pressure, and limits h"

Gunmen abducted Robert Tarongoy, 31, on Monday in Baghdad, along with an American, a Nepalese and two Iraqi guards working for the Saudi Arabian Trading and Construction Co.
The kidnappers later released the two Iraqis and officials said Friday the Nepalese hostage also had been freed. There has been no word on the other captives.
The Iraqi government and the coalition forces have provided no information about the identity of the kidnappers or their demands, the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
A crisis management team and the Philippine Embassy in Baghdad are ""activating all their contacts in Iraq to ascertain the whereabouts"" of Tarongoy and his abductors, the statement said.
A Philippine official said the United States has asked Manila not to give any concessions to the kidnappers and to provide the Americans with an ""open-ended authority"" to deal with the crisis.
In July, insurgents snatched truck driver Angelo dela Cruz and persuaded Manila to recall its small peacekeeping force early in exchange for his life. The move was sharply criticized by Washington and its allies but hailed in the Philippines.
""Robert is a good man with deep respect for all Muslims,"" Tarongoy's wife, Ivy, said. ""My country, the Philippines, has no troops in Iraq. My husband and I wish only the best for the Iraqi people.
""I ask that he be freed as a symbol of goodwill and friendship between the peoples of Iraq and the Philippines,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I do not see any more possible grievances that the kidnappers may have against the Philippine government.""
""I feel so very much in pain. I'm still wondering if he is still alive,"" she said.
About 300 activists held a protest in Manila demanding Tarongoy's release but also blaming President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's government for growing unemployment that forced him and tens of thousands of other Filipinos to find work in risky areas abroad.
Ivy Tarongoy said her husband bargained hard for his US$900 (euro 708) monthly salary - nearly nine times what he earned in his southern hometown of Davao.
""Robert went to Iraq to find decent work for our family's future,"" she said. ""The pay was good, but that means nothing if we lose him.""
Labor Secretary Patricia Santo Tomas warned Filipinos against defying a government ban on Filipinos working in Iraq imposed after the July hostage crisis.
More than 4,000 Filipinos work in U.S. military camps across Iraq, mostly as maintenance workers and cooks. About 2,000 Filipinos have entered Iraq since the ban was imposed.

"4583",20061835,"Title: Nepal begins drafting new interim constitution.rtf; Date: June 26, 2006 Monday 6:46 AM GMT; Text: A committee headed by a former Supreme Court judge began work Monday on drafting an interim constitution for Nepal, a key demand of the country's communist rebels to renounce their decade-long insurgency.
However, the panel was not expected to meet a Friday deadline for presenting a first draft of the constitution to the country's leaders. Committee member Harihar Dahal said it could take weeks for the committee to adequately gather information and consult the public on the document.
Also, the full membership of the committee still had not been finalized.
""We are still waiting for the government to add new members to the committee. We expect the announcement today,"" Dahal said.
The rebels have said they would join the country's new government only after the interim constitution is in place.
The committee's current six members all former judges or legal experts were chosen during a meeting of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, rebel leader Prachanda, and several leaders of the seven-party ruling alliance on June 16.
They also agreed during that meeting that a first draft of the constitution expected to officially strip the monarch of his power over the legislature and army would be presented to the country's leaders on Friday.
But Dahal said that could take weeks as the committee still has to collect expert opinion and then consult the public. ""We have begun to do our research and study models of constitution from different countries,"" he said.
Rewriting the constitution has been a key rebel demand and the stumbling block during previous rounds of peace talks in 2001 and 2003.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and replace it with a communist state, but earlier this year joined an alliance of political parties to force King Gyanendra to relinquish the absolute power he had seized in early 2005.
Weeks of often bloody street protests eventually forced the king in April to reinstate Parliament and name veteran politician Koirala as prime minister.
The new government agreed to draft an interim constitution that would stand until a special assembly, to be elected within the year, wrote a new constitution for the impoverished Himalayan kingdom.
Work on the constitution was delayed after women's and minority ethnic groups protested that they also should be included on the committee.

"6189",20071943,"Title: US state officials report 17 latent cases of TB after Nepalese student dies.rtf; Date: November 26, 2007 Monday 12:46 AM GMT; Text: Health officials have detected 17 cases of latent tuberculosis after a Nepalese student attending Colorado State University-Pueblo died of the disease.
The 17 people who were infected likely had come into contact with 19-year-old Kalpana Dangol, who lived in Colorado Springs while attending the university in Pueblo, The Denver Post reported.
Juli Bettridge, an investigator for the state health department, said 10 of the 17 are being treated for the disease. The other seven have moved or are refusing treatment, she said.
Most people with latent TB are not likely to develop an active infection, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. However, people in at-risk groups, such as those with HIV, are urged to get treatment.
Dangol died June 8, hours after she was taken to Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs. Health officials tested 149 people in Pueblo and El Paso counties who had come in contact with her.
Meanwhile, 15 Pueblo police officers have filed casualty reports after the arrest of a 71-year-old man with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
""Odds are the officers are not infected with TB,"" Pueblo Police Chief Jim Billings told the Pueblo Chieftain on Saturday. ""Just to make sure, though, we gave each officer a workmen's compensation claim (report) where they give a blood sample so they can have a baseline reading.""
The name of the man, who was arrested on municipal warrants, was not released. He was put in a medical quarantine at an undisclosed location. There was no known link with Dangol's case.
Pueblo County Undersheriff J.R. Hall said the disease was detected during a medical screening at the jail of the man arrested Thursday. He said as many as 22 officers and some jail personnel may have come into contact with the man.
Jody Carrillo, the health department's director of disease prevention and emergency preparedness, said TB is very hard to contract, and would likely require being in contact with a victim for many hours in cramped quarters.
All staff who had contact with the man will undergo a skin reaction test. If they test negative they will be tested against in 10 to 12 weeks. A second negative test will clear them.
A positive test, while not meaning the person has the disease, will result in further tests.
Health department staffers plan to interview the man to find out with whom he had contact with for the past couple of months.
According to jail records, the TB patient served a six-day sentence for contempt of court on a municipal charge last month. Apparently the disease was not detected then.

""10,000 landmines have been laid around 50 army posts as defensive measures,"" said Miriam Coronel Ferrer, one of a six-member ICBL team which has been in Nepal for the last week.
She said they had been given the figure by Director of Military Operations (DMO) Brigadier General Kul Bahadur Khadka.
Khadka told them the army would clear the landmines before they left the posts. It was not known when they were laid.
During a week-long visit, the team met with government and army officials and Maoist rebel leaders to discuss banning the use of landmines in the Himalayan kingdom.
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire on January 29 and have since held two rounds of peace talks aimed at ending seven years of insurgency.
""Since the ceasefire, the Nepal Campaign to Ban Landmines received only one report of a civilian injured by landmines,"" Ferrer told reporters late Saturday.
""But there is a danger that people will fall victim to these mines unless the security forces and the Maoists commit not to use them and clear those areas,"" she said.
Ferrer said they had met senior Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara who said he would consult the rebel leadership on a long term commitment to a total ban on the use of landmines.
Nepal is not a signatory to the 1997 Ottowa Convention, ratified by more than 130 countries, which bans the production and use of anti-personnel mines as well as their storage and transportation.
Ferrer said that between January and December 2002, 5,946 people were killed in fighting between security forces and the Maoists.
They included 4,760 rebels, 539 policemen, 219 soldiers, 22 children and 26 women, Ferrer said, adding the figures were based on reports from ex-lawmakers, newspapers, the army and the police.
She said 720 of those killed were killed by mines.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising as claimed nearly 8,000 lives, according to official figures.

Text of report by Nepalese radio Kantipur FM on 25 November
Maoist Chairman Prachanda says that he has ordered the party's youth wing, the YCL [Young Communist League], which has come under widespread flak, to refrain from in extortion, abduction and physical attacks.
Pledging that the anarchic activities carried out by the YCL in the past will not be repeated again, Prachanda has claimed that the YCL will henceforth become a sage.
In a discussion with opinion makers in Chitwan [central Nepal] District today, Prachanda also claimed that all YCL activities had been stopped because the outfit started operating in defiance of party directives.
He disclosed that, with the aim of easing the excesses people are suffering, he intended to issue a public statement within a few days asking people not to give donations [to the YCL].
Prachanda said that the recent attack by the YCL on a group, including a medical doctor, in Morang [district in southeastern Nepal] had stunned him. He said: ""A person whom I had called for a discussion was blackmailed and beaten up. I was stunned when I heard that the person was abducted right from the airport and beaten up.""
When the participants in the function inquired about YCL activities, Prachanda said that he had participated in the just concluded central meeting of the YCL and had decided that the group would not engage in anarchic acts henceforth.
Meanwhile, the YCL, holding a news conference in the capital, engaged in self-criticism for its past failings and said that it would not allow such acts to happen in the future.
The central meeting, which has just ended, determined that many YCL acts were against the organization's policy.

The following are highlights from Sakhalin Region's state-owned GTRK Sakhalin TV and commercial Alternative Sakhalin TV news, Sovetskiy Sakhalin newspaper, Sakh.com news wire and RIA Sakhalin-Kurily news agency wire for the period 11-17 February 2008:
Presidential election
An agreement to support presidential candidate Dmitriy Medvedev has been signed in Sakhalin, RIA Sakhalin-Kurily reported on 14 February. The agreement on partnership and cooperation during the Russian presidential campaign was signed at a meeting of the heads of Sakhalin Region branches of One Russia, A Just Russia, Civil Force and the Agrarian Party of Russia held in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on 14 February. The agreement sealed the decision to support Medvedev running for Russian presidency made by the four parties in Moscow in December 2007. For the first time the leaders of parties of a wide political spectrum - centrists, socialists and the right-wingers - supported one of the contenders. They believe that Medvedev will be the guarantor for the succession of the political course of incumbent President Vladimir Putin, the agency said. (RIA Sakhalin-Kurily news agency, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 0709 gmt 14 Feb 08)
Early voting in the presidential election will be held in Sakhalin Region's remote areas from 14 February to 1 March, Lyudmila Lukyanova, secretary of the Sakhalin Region electoral commission, told Alternative Sakhalin TV. The remote areas include border outposts, beacons, fishing camps, villages that have no transport communication with the district centres in Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinskiy, Poronayskiy, Smirnykhovskiy, Makarovskiy, Nevelskiy, Noglikskiy, Okhinskiy and Tomarinskiy districts as well as on the Kuril Islands. A total of over 2,000 people reside in remote areas. Depending on the terrain, the electoral commission members will use all kinds of motor or air transport.
From 15 February to 1 March the Nevelsk marine electoral commission will also conduct early voting among those electors who will be at sea on the election day; there are 2,000 of them. As many as 4,500 people in Sakhalin Region cast their ballots early in the State Duma election on 2 December 2007, the report said. (Alternative Sakhalin TV ""Nash Den"" news, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 0930 gmt 14 Feb 08)
Political
Sakhalin Region governor Aleksandr Khoroshavin made a report on social and economic development of Sakhalin Region at the conference of the heads of regions of the Russian Far East and Transbaykal area chaired by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev on 7 February, Sovetskiy Sakhalin reported on 12 February.
Khoroshavin informed Medvedev about the economic development of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, saying that over a quarter of the gross regional product of the entire Far Eastern Federal District falls to Sakhalin Region with the population of only 500,000. Sakhalin Region has also the lowest level of unemployment and the highest rates of investment in production, while the incomes of Sakhalin residents grew by 23 per cent in 2007.
Sakhalin Region could become self-sufficient; however, it has to settle a number of issues first, the virtual isolation of the island being the most important one. The absence of a reliable tunnel or a bridge from the mainland together with the obsolete ferry service and high air tariffs do only deepen this impression.
Sakhalin Region could implement many projects on its own, Khoroshavin said. This can be done provided the previous distribution scheme of subsoil tax (60 per cent to the region and 40 per cent to the federal centre) is reinstated. In the long run, all these proposals are aimed at retaining the people. This issue is very topical for Sakhalin as some 200,000 people left the region since 1991. ""Absolutely correct,"" said Medvedev in reaction to Khoroshavin's report. (Sovetskiy Sakhalin newspaper, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 12 Feb 08 p 1)
Migration
Most of Sakhalin Region's foreign workers are employed in construction, RIA Sakhalin-Kurily reported on 14 February. In late December 2007 the number of economically active people totalled 298,700 (57.3 per cent of the entire population). As many as 284,500 (95.2 per cent) of them are employed and 14,200 (4.8 per cent) are unemployed, the State Statistics Service Directorate for Sakhalin Region said.
In 2007 the employment of foreign labour in the Sakhalin Region's economy increased. As many as 29,614 foreign nationals were engaged for work in Sakhalin Region; 76.1 per cent up year-on-year. They came from 82 countries. The influx of foreign labour from the CIS countries, Australia, the UK, India, Indonesia, Canada, China, Malaysia, Nepal, the Netherlands, Philippines and Japan considerably increased. The majority of employed foreign labour came from the CIS countries (30.1 per cent), Philippines (14.8 per cent), Turkey (11.2 per cent) and North Korea (9.2 per cent).

  The decision to ban the Maoist organisations was taken at a cabinet meeting in Raipur, which was headed by Chief Minister Raman Singh.
  However, the ban would be imposed after getting an approval from Union Home Ministry. 
  ?Although CPI (Maoist) is banned under a Central Act, but the state ban would help the local police in combating and controlling the frontal organisations of the group also,? said the Chief Minister. 
  The state has a history of frequent Naxal attacks. Late last month, four security personnel were injured following an attack by Maoists on a police camp, which was engaged in an anti-Naxal operation at Bal Ashram in Padeda village of south Bastar.
  The CPI (Maoist) was formed when the MCC and the PWG merged to form a deadly and extremely powerful naxal outfit whose injunction runs across large areas liberated by rebels. Left wing terrorism has engulfed about 100 districts all across the country. 
  They have gained access in the tribal belt running from Nepal Border to the Rayalseema region of Andhra. According to reports, they have started spreading their tentacles in U.P, Uttranchal and Kerala also.  
  The Union Home Ministry had organized a Chief Ministers' Conference on Internal Security and Law and Order in New Delhi in April. Among the new proposals that came up for discussion, was a proposal for a long-term coordination between the Center and the nine naxal affected states.
  It was then decided that the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttaranchal, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh would meet periodically and decide upon the steps to check naxal activity. It was also agreed that the panel of chief ministers would take inputs from the Coordination Center headed by the Union Home Secretary and also take into account socio-economic and political factors behind the spread of Naxal violence.

"2735",20044658,"Title: Kashmir leaders end conference with call to reduce violence.rtf; Date: December 14, 2004 Tuesday 1:20 PM GMT; Text: Separatists from the Indian and Pakistani zones of Kashmir ended a conference in Nepal Tuesday with a call for renewed efforts to stem violence and rebuild the economy in the troubled region, organizers said.
The four-day meet held behind closed doors in Kathmandu was a rare chance for separatists from both sides of divided Kashmir to discuss the Himalyan region's future among themselves.
""The conference attended by 50 individuals from Jammu and Kashmir, India  and Pakistan discussed ways of ending more than five decades of conflict and establishing a secure and prosperous future for the peoples of this vital region of South Asia,"" said Paolo Cotta-Ramusino, secretary general of the International Pugwash Foundation which organized the meet.
""For the first time in many years, members of political parties, non- governmental organisations and civil society from both sides of the Line of Control were able to meet each other in an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation,"" Cotta-Ramusino told reporters.
Pugwash holds conferences around the world to seek solutions to global problems.
He said the participants discussed issues in a closed forum to hear different viewpoints.
""The meeting did not adopt any resolution as it was not intended to put specific proposals for the parties to decide on the Kashmir issue,"" he said.
Pugwash, which is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, hopes to hold further meetings, but hasn't set a date or venue.
""This open hearted discussion among the participants is expected to help a lot in building confidence among the people of Jammu and Kashmir, promoting contacts and communication between all parties concerned over the issue lingering for the last 57 years,"" he added.
Kashmir is at the center of a conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over the Himalayan region.
Both countries hold part of the state and claim it in full
Muslim rebels, most of them wanting to secede Kashmir from India and join with Muslim-majority Pakistan, launched an insurgency in 1989 that has so far claimed 40,000 lives by official count. Separatists put the toll between 80,000 and 100,000.
India and Pakistan started a peace process early this year with both sides respecting a ceasefire along the de facto border known as the Line of Control. Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil said last week there had been a 60 percent decline in rebel incursions from Pakistan.
""The participants welcomed the resumption of the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan in the hope that a sustained dialogue between the two countries will lead to enhanced confidence and greater cooperation,"" Cotta-Ramusino said.
Participants included leaders of the moderate wing of the main separatist alliance Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Abdul Ghani Bhat, politicians, former ambassadors, retired generals and rights activists from India and Pakistan

"7056",2008424,"Title: Coming round the mountain.rtf; Date: April 15, 2008 Tuesday 4:14 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, April 15 -- H e was once criticised by his party for his fondness for momos. Along with the regular Gregorian calendar that we all follow, he also uses the Hindu Shaka calendar. He is a Maoist who has beaten all Marxist-Leninists to emerge as the leader of the world's first elected far-Left party.
  The irony of the impending Maoist electoral victory in the Nepalese constituent assembly led by this man, Pushpa Kamal Dahal a.k.a. Prachanda, never ceases to amaze. This was a force that every communist and democratic formation of the subcontinent had written off as a 'bunch of anarchists'. The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) - the CPN(M) - was, in fact, painted as yet another terrorist outfit.
  But Nepal had not yet given its verdict. The pro-democracy movement in 1990 had ushered in the concept of a multi-party democracy in this landlocked, feudal country where bourgeois impulses were weak and where monarchy flourished. But as years went by, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) - CPN(UM-L) - the two mainstream parties in the country, were unable to address the people's concerns.
  The power of the king was curtailed, but a move to impose constitutional monarchy was shot down as the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) became ambitious and the king too became a willing tool in the hands of the United States, which was keen on building Nepal as a buffer between India and China.
  The RNA-backed monarchy started clawing back to power in a bid to regain privileges lost during the pro-democracy movement. The pro-democracy mainstream parties, with no armed cadre to respond to the violence unleashed on the Nepalese people by the Palace-RNA combine, felt helpless.
  It was at this point in 1996 that the Maoists stepped in. Realising that pro-democracy parties had been taken for a ride and were becoming irrelevant in the new situation of counter-revolutionary offensives, they retired to the villages, jungles and hills to mobilise the Nepalese peasantry. At first, the Maoists did not have weapons either. During the 1990 pro-democracy movement, they were part of the general 'Left impulse', which had laid emphasis more on mass movement than on armed struggle.
  Adopting classic Maoist tactics of capturing arms from the enemy, Nepal's Maoists captured the Dang barrack of the RNA. Now they had enough arms to last for four years. In February 2005, when the bloody palace coup installed King Gyanendra on Nepal's throne with covert American and overt RNA backing, democratic rights and the parliamentary process were suppressed.
  The people of Kathmandu and those of Nepal's villages were overwhelmingly against the official version that Prince Dipendra committed the massacre. As pro-democracy parties vacillated, the Maoists came up with the firm political slogan of abolishing the monarchy, restoring democratic rights and setting up a national people's republic. This stance struck a chord as it was widely believed that Gyanendra was a usurper. The monarchy had lost the reverence and support of the people like never before.
  The Maoist strategy worked. In the post-February 2005 situation, Maoists were the only power taking the RNA and Gyanendra head on. Yet, this was clearly not enough. Despite leading a backward, feudal-bourgeois State, the Nepalese ruling clique was part of the new post-9/11 global environment. The Nepalese ruling clique, fighting against the Maoists that the US perceived to be a 'terrorist group', had the support of Washington in terms of arms, material and 'advice'.
  The sounds of fights in the hilly villages of Nepal between the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) and RNA forces echoed in India and even in Washington.
  But Nepalese Maoists were fighting a different kind of 'people's war'. Following the new far Left path of Prachanda, the CPN(M) and the PLA stopped being confined to isolated areas and the grassroots.
  Their anti-feudalism had a village-level character as well as a national-mainstream character. The restoration of democratic rights and the removal of the monarchy remained the final political target of the armed struggle. The CPN(M) was also being perceived as a 'patriotic force' by a growing number of Nepal's people.
  Prachanda declared a unilateral ceasefire when in 2006 Gyanendra was going to address the United Nations. The move robbed Gyanendra off propaganda value against the Maoists. After that, the Maoists showed tactical flexibility in suspending their armed struggle, and started engaging the mainstream parties in a dialogue. In the process, they started to show a willingness to become part of the mainstream democratic process, proposing a whole range of options including participation in direct elections to a new constituent assembly, and even the merger of the PLA in a new Nepalese army.
  Within the overall ambit of abolishing monarchy, the Maoist position kept changing as per the demands of the situation. They e"
"99",20032862,"Title: Red Cross to step up dialogue with Nepalese govt, Maoists.rtf; Date: January 15, 2003 Wednesday; Text: The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Wednesday said it would step up dialogue with the Nepalese government and Maoist rebels in a bid to improve conditions for people living in conflict zones of the Himalayan kingdom.
An ICRC statement released in New Delhi said the organisation's Indian branch had studied the areas worst-affected by the strife in neighbouring Nepal.
""In view of the findings, the ICRC plans to step up dialogue between the government and the Maoists with a view to ensuring or restoring freedom of movement for people and goods and improving civilian security,"" the statement said.
Maoist rebels have have been waging a ""people's war"" since 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state.
Nearly 7,800 people have been killed in the violent insurgency, according to army figures.
The ICRC team visited Nepal's remote central-west region and found that while there is currently no major food shortage in the areas surveyed, commerce and transport had been severely affected, the statement said.
""Restrictions imposed by both parties, a chronically poor transport system and insecurity arising from the fighting are all inhibiting commerce and transport,"" it said.
If the problems persist, families could be deprived of their primary coping mechanisms while migrants and breadwinners working in other areas may be prevented from returning home.
The agency said its staff visited areas controlled respectively by the government and the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist and talked to representatives of both parties.
The ICRC, it added, will regularly monitor economic security in areas affected by the conflict ""and build up and maintain its capacity to act in the event of an emergency.""
The New Delhi office will share its information with the Nepal Red Cross Society and coordinate with workers there, it said.
The humanitarian agency planned to strengthen its presence in areas most affected by conflict.
In the meantime, the ICRC will continue visiting detainees held in connection with the insurgency, assisting health-care facilities for the wounded and monitoring the sanitation situation, among other things.
In 2001 the Nepalese government and guerrillas entered a ceasefire but after three rounds of peace talks stalled the rebels resumed their attacks.
The government responded by declaring a national state of emergency in November 2001, during which freedom of assembly, association and movement were suspended.
The emergency was lifted last August.

Now nearly six months old, Prince Hridayendra was taken to the temple after a ceremony at the Narayanhiti Palace in which he took his first bites of solid food.
It was the first public appearance for the prince, the grandson of King Gyanendra and an heir to the throne. Traffic was blocked and a public holiday declared to mark the occasion.
An army band played tunes while celebrants set off firecrackers and threw flowers along the two-mile route from the palace to the temple.
Hindu tradition requires babies to be fed soft rice in the days before they reach their sixth month. The royal baby, whose name means ""king of hearts,"" was fed by his mother, Princess Himani, and father, Crown Prince Paras.
Gyanendra assumed the throne after his brother and eight members of the royal family were killed in a June 1, 2000 palace massacre that the government said was carried out by then-Crown Prince Dipendra, who shot himself and later died in hospital.
The killings shook the Himalayan kingdom, and set off violent protests across the country because people refused to accept that their popular king had been gunned down by his son.
King Gyanendra himself only made his first public appearance outside the capital last week, addressing a huge throng and giving a televised speech.
In another sign that the royal family is moving toward normalcy, the king's daughter, Princess Prerna, 24, is getting married on Jan. 22. Her bridegroom is a commoner, Raj Bahadur Singh, 29.

The one-meter (two-and-a-half foot) mask, adorned with turquoise and precious stones, is one of 50 images paraded each year in a special incantation by the Buddhist community of Patan on Kathmandu's outskirts.
The icon of the crowned Buddha, known as the Dipankar Buddha, vanished in January 2002 when it was being kept by a family in Patan.
It resurfaced four months later when a Cologne-based dealer tried to sell it to the Ethnographic Museum in Vienna for 200,000 euros (235,000 dollars), officials said.
Museum curator Christian Schicklgruber suspected the image may have been stolen and started an investigation that led to a theft case being filed in an Austrian court, officials said.
The Austrian government decided to return the icon to Nepal.
""I am very much delighted to hand over the historic Buddhist icon after its 15-month sojourn in Austria,"" Austrian Ambassador Jutta Stefan Bastl said at the function at Nepal's culture ministry.
The Buddha icon was authenticated by Alexander von Rospatt, a scholar of South Asian religion at the University of Vienna and the University of California at Berkeley.
""This is a precious item of major religious significance, not a normal object of commercial trade,"" Rospatt said here.
Nepalese officials have expressed hope that the return of the Dipankar Buddha could trigger the return of more icons that have vanished from Nepal over the years.

The judges scrapped the Royal Commission for Corruption Control and said its decisions should be invalidated. The court ruling said the panel was set up ""against the norms and spirit of the constitution.""
The decision comes as a blow to the monarch, who has said he created the commission to bring corrupt politicians and bureaucrats to justice. But opponents said the body was simply a tool for the king to crack down on his adversaries.
The king formed the anti-graft panel immediately after seizing power on Feb. 1, 2005, when he arrested leading politicians and declared emergency rule. The commission was given broad powers to investigate and jail politicians and government bureaucrats.
The king justified his takeover by saying it was needed to combat a communist insurgency that has claimed about 13,000 lives since 1996, and to bring political stability to the country. He also promised to control corruption.

The petition will be disposed of on Friday.
The court could not pass the order on Thursday, as the bail application was filed a day before it is permitted by the law. An accused can apply for bail only after the completion of 90 days in custody. Krishna will complete 90 days on Friday.
Krishna's lawyer F.C. Sharma said, ""The application would be disposed of tomorrow as no order could be passed today."" Sharma had earlier petitioned to the court in June to discharge his client under a section that was deemed 'non-applicable' by the court.
Raj Kumar, another accused in the case, also filed his bail application through his lawyer in another Ghaziabad court. The application was later transferred to the designated CBI court. It will also be heard on Friday.
Vijay Mandal, co-accused in the case, is already out on bail. Krishna and Raj Kumar moved bail applications in view of the failure of the CBI to file a chargesheet within the stipulated 90 days.
The chargesheet submission deadline lapsed on Wednesday, after which the accused are allowed to seek bail as per law. Meanwhile, in a press conference on Tuesday, the CBI made it clear that it will ""present the full facts of the case in a truthful and professional manner"" if and when an accused applies for bail.
Aarushi Talwar and the family's domestic help Hemraj, a Nepal citizen were killed on May 15/16 in the Talwars' Noida residence. The Noida police had first accused Hemraj of killing Aarushi, but his body was found on the terrace of the house the next day.

India has been pressing for the extradition of underworld figure Dawood Ibrahim, reportedly based in Pakistan and wanted in connection with deadly blasts which killed more than 250 people in the western city of Mumbai in 1993.
Islamabad denies he is in Pakistan.
The Indian and Pakistan agencies will designate an official in each other's country for cooperation on crime-related matters, and top CBI officials will visit Pakistan this year.

Katmandu district chief administrator Jaya Mukunda Khanal said the three were arrested Thursday for violating the Public Security Act and will be kept behind bars for 90 days.
They were the first among Tibetan refugees in Nepal sentenced to jail terms since March, when almost-daily protests started to condemn China's crackdown in the Himalayan region in front of the Chinese Embassy and United Nations offices in Katmandu.
Khanal identified the Tibetans as Kelsang Chung, Ngawang Sangmo and Tashi Dolma.
China says 22 people died in anti-government violence in Tibet's capital Lhasa in March, while foreign Tibet supporters say many times that number were killed in the protests and a subsequent crackdown.
Nepalese police have been breaking up the rallies and until now only briefly detained protesters before letting them go.
Authorities have banned protests by the Tibetan exiles, saying demonstrations against friendly nations, including China, will not be allowed. Tibetan refugees have also been barred from all political activities.
The United Nations and international rights groups have criticized Nepal for using what they say is excessive force to stop the protests. Police have beaten people with batons and dragged them through the streets while detaining them.
Thousand of Tibetans were allowed to live in Nepal or pass through on their way from Tibet to Dharmasala in India, where Tibetan spiritual leaders live in exile.

 Kathmandu: At a time when the movement against regression has attained some height, the five agitating parties have announced a new phase of protest programmes for the month of Pus 16 December- 14 January .
 A meeting of the task force of the Central Movement Coordination Committee held on Monday 29 December at the central office of the Nepali Congress party has decided to hold countrywide movement in the month of Pus.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 30 Dec 03Passage omitted
 In the movement programmes of the agitating parties for the month of Pus are, protest rallies, protest meetings, sit-ins, picketing, torch rallies, effigy burning etc. The sister organizations of the parties will also hold similar programmes in the month.

Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 3 May
[Headlined ""Nepali media face multiple challenges"", by Indra Adhikari]
Despite a significant shift in the political atmosphere of the country after the success of the democratic movement, Nepali media over the past year continued to face hurdles, harassment and obstruction that led to the restriction in free flow of information.
Some important changes have been observed in the past one year but the situation is still far from satisfactory. The unstable political situation and the government's inability to address the demands put forth by various groups, which has led to continuation of unrest, are the major contributing factors for spoiling the atmosphere.
While the media was out in the front in the movement led by the political parties last year to topple the King's regime, the parties who had repeatedly expressed commitments to adhere to principles of press freedom and unhindered access to information are yet to keep those promises.
State indifference
General secretary of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) Mahendra Bista sees the traditional psychology in political leadership and their consideration towards addressing only the political issues at this period as the cause of lack in improvement in situation of press freedom.
Bista says the threats and harassment to journalists came from the parties in struggle like Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum (MJF), Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) and other various groups who were rather demanding their representation in political mainstream. The agitating parties made several attempts to press media to disseminate of news of their interests.
President of South Asia Free Media Association (SAFMA) Nepal chapter Gopal Thapaliya says the criminal groups have been the biggest threat to journalists and media workers in Terai [southern plains]. 
""During the military rule by the King, media persons had worked openly though they faced censorship. But today, their lives are at risk, anyone identifying himself as media person in Terai has to take risk of his life. This is the most serious issue that state has failed to address today,"" he added. He accused the eight parties to be dictatorial in terms of guaranteeing the press freedom and freedom of expression of the citizens.
The ruling parties, against their earlier commitments, continue to take government owned media as their party propaganda instruments. Changes in the leadership in these media institutions continue. Bista says this is of most undemocratic nature. Thapaliya says this would violate the right to correct information guaranteed to the citizens.
Facts and figures
According to the report by Freedom Forum, 32 cases of attacks on journalists have been recorded in the period between 25 April 2006 and 14 April 2007. The cases of attacks in this period have risen from 18 in the same period in 2005-2006.
The number of threats recorded has more than doubled to 83 over the past year, compared to 33 in 2005-2006.
There is a drastic reduction in the cases of arrests, manhandling and beating of journalists. But the actions of the government, Maoists and other groups have led to continued unsafe working conditions for journalists, and have hindered the free flow of information.
No significant progress has been made with regard to media law or policy though the interim constitution makes progressive provisions regarding the press freedom and security of the working journalists.
In the Terai region in particular, journalists faced death threats during strikes and protests carried out by the MJF, the JTMM, the Madhesi Tigers, the Chure Bhawar Ekata Samaj and other groups. Following death threats or threats of physical actions, journalists were forced to write favourable reports of these groups' activities.
The Maoist leadership has repeatedly expressed its commitment to press freedom but their cadres continue to harass, threaten and abuse journalists.
More than 112 journalists have been manhandled, mistreated or beaten by members of the MJF, JTMM, the Madhesi Tigers, other political parties of the eight party coalition and security forces. 26 journalists were arrested and detained by the police and Maoists and two cases of abduction were recorded in this period.
Thirteen cases where publications were banned or confiscated, including one instance when the state-owned Nepal Television channel cancelled the transmission of one of its programmes. ""Sarbajanik Sunuwai"" (""Public Hearing""), have been recorded. Similarly, six cases of unfair dismissal from job, three cases of legal action and three cases of administrative action were recorded in the period.
Of the 83 death threats or threats of violence in 2063, most were issued by the MJF, JTMM and the Madhesi Tiger groups. Maoist, Janajati bodies and other political party members, including their student bodies, are also implicated.

Warships, cruisers and ferries crisscrossed the eastern Mediterranean from ports in Lebanon toward Cyprus and Turkey, packed with refugees, while planes brought more back to their homelands.
Convoys of buses meanwhile headed toward Syria, or from the war-torn south of Lebanon toward the north which has been less badly hit by Israel's offensive against the Shiite Hezbollah movement, now in its 10th day.
""You see these situations on TV and feel sorry for the people. Now we are the ones that feel like refugees,"" said mother-of-two Brenda Fawaz, 41, at a transit camp in Nicosia set up to handle an estimated 6,000 American nationals expected in the coming days.
""My children were scared -- we stayed inside most of the time. In America you don't see things like that,"" added Fawaz, from Tampa, Florida.
A UN-chartered cruise ship docked in Larnaca, Cyprus, early Friday carrying 900 UN staff, dependants and other evacuees from 46 different countries.
They joined the 20,000 foreign nationals who have passed through Cyprus since the sealift began in earnest on Monday.
Also docked at Larnaca was the US navy transport vessel USS Nashville with 1,000 mostly US citizens aboard, bringing the number evacuated out of Lebanon via Cyprus in the past 24 hours to almost 2,000.
Another 4,500 Americans were due to depart on three ships, assisted by US Marines.
Some 3,000 French nationals have been pulled out of Lebanon this week so far, with between 4,000 and 5,000 remaining to be evacuated.
French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said around 400 French citizens were trapped in southern Lebanon, where the fighting has been deadliest, and that an operation would be mounted in the coming days to try to reach them.
Germany was also working to extricate its nationals from the south, having already evacuated around 4,200 of its citizens.
The Italian government said that some 300 of its nationals were left.
In Britain, the defence ministry said about 2,800 people had been rescued from Lebanon by British forces since it began its operation, including more than 1,000 who docked late Thursday in Cyprus.
British warships were shuttling the 160 kilometres (100 miles) between Lebanon and Cyprus. London said it intended to evacuate 5,000 people in all by the end of the week.
Australia sent 65 military personnel and 26 extra diplomatic staff to the island to help process about 7,000 Australians trying to leave. It plans to ship up to 6,000 to safety by Sunday evening.
Three passenger ferries brought 736 Canadians to Mersin, southern Turkey, some of around 2,000 Canadians expected to return home via that country.
The first 88 Canadian evacuees from Lebanon arrived home in Ottawa aboard the prime minister's jet from Cyprus early Friday, greeted by family and friends. A second aircraft landed in Montreal three hours later with 184 evacuees.
Nine countries -- Australia, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Moldova and Sweden -- are organising operations via Turkey.
Around the world from Bangkok to Ottawa, Colombo to Sao Paulo, Mumbai to Warsaw, evacuees stepped off planes to emotional reunions with worried relatives. Some were even welcomed home by government ministers.
Most were exhausted by the ordeal.
""We have had a very tiring journey, but we were very well treated by the British authorities who helped us a lot in getting us back safely,"" Mimi Kobrossi, 52, said when she arrived at Gatwick airport, southeast Britain.
In Austria, three children who had been visiting grandparents in Lebanon were now back safely home, the Kurier daily reported. Ahmad, 11, said the holiday ""was fun ... except when bombs fell.""
Early on Friday 37 Spanish and Portuguese nationals arrived in Lisbon on a C-130 cargo plane from Cyprus in the first rescue flight organized by the Portuguese government.
Algerian aid planes returned on Friday with more than 100 rescued Algerian nationals. Rabat said 436 of its 700 nationals trying to leave Lebanon had reached Morocco.
Cyprus on Friday recorded the largest influx of evacuees, from 50 different countries, since the pounding of Lebanon began on July 12.
More than 6,000 foreign nationals disembarked in the ports of Larnaca and Limassol before lunchtime and almost as many more are expected to reach Cyprus shores before the next sunrise.
Poorer countries, however, struggled to evacuate thousands of their citizens from Lebanon. Nepalese, Ghanaian, Filipino, Bangladeshi, Moldovan and Iraqi nationals appealed to the International Migration Organisation for help.

Excerpt from unattributed report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 10 July
Kathmandu, 9 July: The Ministry of Defence [MOD] has questioned the chief of army staff, Pyar Jung Thapa, over his visiting the Royal Palace on the king's birthday and presenting a royal salute.
In reply, Army Chief Thapa said he alone had gone to the palace to congratulate the king and the Nepalese Army Headquarters had no role in presenting royal salute, the secretary at the MOD, Bishnu Datta Upreti, said on Sunday [9 July]. Secretary Upreti questioned the army chief about the matter on the phone after it became public that the chief of army staff and other army officials had visited the Royal Palace in contravention of a government decision.
""I inquired with the chief of army staff about this,"" Upreti told the State Affairs Committee at the House of Representatives, adding, ""The chief of army staff said he alone visited [the Royal Palace] in line with tradition."" Thapa in uniform had visited the Royal Palace on Friday [7 July] on the occasion of the king's 60th birthday. That day the army had accorded a 21-gun salute to the king.
The Council of Ministers had, however, decided not to celebrate the king's birthday. Respecting the government decision, the chiefs of Armed Police Force and Nepal Police did not visit the Royal Palace. The army chief said the army headquarters has nothing to with the 21-gun salute as it is part of the palace's own programme for Tika [Vijaya Dashami day] during Dashain [festival that falls in September-October], Bhaitika day [during Tihar, the festival of lights, falls in October] and king's birthday. ""The gun salutes are part of palace's own programme and the Army Headquarters has nothing to do with them. The Army Headquarters has no role in them,"" Upreti quoted Army Chief Thapa as saying.
Upreti said the process to recall military officials at the Royal Palace who are on assignment from the Army Headquarters has begun. ""They will be recalled in a few days,"" he said. There are nine army officials including Maj-Gen Gajendra Limbu at the Military Secretariat at the Royal Palace.
The members of the [State Affairs] committee demanded the reason behind the government's not taking action against Army Chief Thapa despite action being taken against the chiefs of other three security wings. Upreti replied: ""The issue of suspending the army chief requires a political decision rather than ministerial one."" [passage omitted: The committee members expressed suspicion that the army was still briefing the Royal Palace on security matters]
A source, however, said the process of scrapping the Military Secretariat has not begun. Since the Military Secretariat is under the Royal Palace, the process of scrapping it has to be initiated by the minister looking after Royal Palace affairs. The Royal Palace affairs portfolio is under the prime minister. [passage omitted: Acting chief secretary Mukunda Prasad Sharma said they were collecting details of king's properties]

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala is on his first foreign trip since being named to the top job last month, after weeks of protests forced King Gyanendra to return power to Parliament.
He was greeted by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, said Jyoti Prasad Adhikari, a Nepalese embassy official.
""We will be asking India's help in the reconstruction of infrastructure and rehabilitation of the people displaced by the conflict, but we are yet to decide on other specific agenda during the trip,"" Nepalese Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told The Associated Press.
""It is a goodwill visit and there will be no major treaties or agreements signed,"" he said.
An Indian package of up to 3 billion rupees (US$65 million; euro54 million) is being worked out for Nepal, including grants and soft loans, for projects decided on by Katmandu, The Indian Express newspaper said.
Koirala, 84, will hold talks with Prime Minister Singh and he is expected to meet several Indian leaders representing the governing Congress party and the opposition.
Ten years of fighting between communist rebels and the government has destroyed telecommunication towers, drinking water projects, roads and irrigation canals.
The fighting also forced thousands of people to flee their villages, seeking safety in cities or across the border in India. Nepal and India share an open border and citizens do not need visas to cross into each other's territories.
The Maoist rebels, who have declared a cease-fire and held one round of peace talks with the new government, want Koirala to press India for the release of rebels detained in Indian jails.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to establish a communist state.

Girija Prasad Koirala made the announcement at the Constituent Assembly, elected in April to rewrite the constitution and govern the Himalayan nation.
Koirala had refused for months to step down and make way for a new government led by the former rebels, who won the most seats in the assembly.
The former guerrillas, formally known as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), resigned from the interim government two weeks ago in an effort to force Koirala, a member of the rival Nepali Congress party, to quit.
""I am here to announce that I am stepping down as prime minister from today,"" Koirala told the assembly Thursday in comments broadcast live on national television.
""Consensus and unity among the political parties have been our strength and I urge all the parties to move ahead continuing this partnership,"" he said.
Koirala has not given a reason for delaying his resignation. But in the months after the election, he had pushed to become president, a post that is to be created by the assembly. The Maoists have resisted, saying someone other than Koirala should fill the presidency.
The Maoists lack a majority in the assembly and must form a coalition with other political parties.
It was not clear when they would formally take power. Their leader, Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, has said the process would begin as soon as Koirala steps down.
In the past, Nepal's king, as head of state, would have accepted the prime minister's resignation. But the last king, Gyanendra, was dethroned last month by the assembly, which declared Nepal a republic.
Koirala became prime minister in 2006 after weeks of pro-democracy protests forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule. Koirala's government soon stripped Gyanendra of all his powers, including his command of the army.

The council's unanimously resolution will increase the U.N. peacekeeping force from 8,700 to 10,800 troops, a move welcomed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
The additional troops would replace an emergency French-led international force sent to Bunia, in northeastern Congo, to reinforce 750 U.N. troops and stem fighting between rival tribal factions.
The French-led international force of 1,500 troops is scheduled to leave by Sept. 1.
A multinational force of 3,000 troops from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal is expected to be in Bunia by the end of September.
The multinational force is expected to gradually expand its operations into the volatile surrounding Ituri region.
""This resolution will allow the United Nations to have a more forceful and flexible presence in the Congo, particularly in the eastern part of the country,"" said U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte.
France and many African nations had backed Annan's call for a larger, more robust U.N. force, but the United States had been reluctant. During President Bush's trip to Africa earlier this month, however, Washington said it would support the increase.
Under the previous mandate, U.N. troops were only allowed to fire in self-defense. The French-led force is authorized to shoot to kill, but only in Bunia.
The new resolution authorizes the U.N. force to protect U.N. personnel and facilities, protect civilians and humanitarian workers ""under imminent threat of physical violence,"" and help improve security conditions so humanitarian aid can be provided.
It authorizes the U.N. force ""to use all necessary means"" to fulfill its mandate in Ituri, and in North and South Kivu in eastern Congo - the scene of continuing violence.
In the past, the Security Council has called on neighboring countries and other nations to stop supplying the weapons that have fueled the five-year-old conflict.
On Monday, the council went a step further, banning the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment in the region ""to all foreign and Congolese armed groups and militias operating in the territory of North and South Kivu and of Ituri"" and to all groups that did not sign the peace agreement in Congo.
The resolution appears to be targeting the heavily armed tribal fighters in Ituri as well as Rwandan and Burundian rebels whose operations in eastern Congo are threatening to derail the peace process.
Since a 1999 cease-fire, foreign troops have withdrawn from Congo and most fighting has stopped, except in the east. Conflict erupted in August 1998, when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into the country to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila.
Congo's president Joseph Kabila, his son, signed a decree on June 30 that established a power-sharing administration of rebels and the government.

""The third round of talks has been suspended but the ceasefire has not ended and it is still there,"" Communications and Information Minister Kamal Thapa announced to reporters here.
""The two sides have agreed to meet again for a fourth round of talks and the time and venue will be decided by the facilitators of both sides within a week.""
Thapa made it clear that talks had foundered on a rebel demand that elections be held for a constituent assembly that would redraw the country's constitution and redefine the role of the constitutional monarchy.
""The rebels insisted on constituent assembly elections to draft a new constitution whereas the government said the same constitution can be amended,"" Thapa said. ""The two sides could not come to an agreement on the subject.""
The third round of peace talks since a ceasefire was signed in January began on Sunday, but immediately faltered when the government rejected the rebels' constituent assembly demand.
Tuesday's session of talks, in the village of Hapure in southwestern Dang district -- a rebel stronghold -- began on an angry note when Maoist chief convenor Baburam Bhattarai lashed out over a weekend incident in which Nepalese troops killed 17 rebels in the country's east.
Some 7,800 people have been killed since the Maoists began their insurgency in 1996.
Maoist sources told AFP that Bhattarai had sought a government explanation for what he termed a ""one-sided action"" by the army in Toromba village in eastern Ramechhapt district.
""The army security along with … police had jointly searched the Maoists' camp and launched a sudden attack, killing at least 17 Maoist activists,"" the source said.
""The Maoist high command is very perturbed by this one-sided action … and if government cannot justify the army actions it may badly affect the peace dialogue.""
Earlier Tuesday, Bhattarai had warned that ""dark clouds"" were hanging over the peace process, though he did not specifically mention the Toromba incident.
Bhattarai confirmed the Maoists' unhappiness with the government stand on the constituent assembly and the future of the constitutional monarchy, which the rebels want dismantled to make way for a communist republic.
""The official working paper submitted to the Maoists (on Sunday) regards the constitutional monarchy as sacrosanct, whereas there is nothing in this world which is unchangeable,"" Bhattarai said in a statement before the day's session began.
""We have been demanding that the Royal army should be restructured but the old regime has been ignoring it.""
Human rights group INSEC said Tuesday that a total of 76 people have been killed in armed clashes since the ceasefire was declared in January.
After months of calm, violence flared anew over a May 8 agreement reached during the second round of talks that police and soldiers will remain within a zone five kilometres (three miles) from their barracks.
The rebels have made it clear they regard security force patrols outside the zones as legitimate targets.
The government, however, says the police and army only move outside the defined zones when the security of the country demands this.

At least two million people were marooned when the Kosi river breached its banks and flooded huge swathes of the eastern state of Bihar.
""About 90,000 victims have been evacuated from villages in the flood affected area by government rescue agencies,"" disaster management official Prataya Amrit told AFP.
More than 400 boats had been pressed into service and hundreds more would be used to shift people to relief shelters and higher land, he said.
At least 46 people are reported to have died in the floods.
Army troops and air force helicopters were helping police in the rescue operation.
Thousands of residents abandoned their homes after the river started shifting course on August 18 and have taken shelter in crowded relief camps or in high-rise buildings.
On Wednesday, the government said one million tonnes of rice and wheat would be distributed to stranded people.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Home Minister Shivraj Patil and the chief of ruling Congress party Sonia Gandhi arrived in Bihar on Thursday to survey the region and review the aid effort.
Monsoon downpours caused the Kosi to swell, burst through its flood levees on the Nepal border and flow through a channel it had previously abandoned.
Nepalese disaster management officials told AFP the river had washed away a series of dams and spurs, which control the water, sending huge torrents downstream that washed way further flood defences.
Authorities on both sides of the border have been in dispute over maintenance of flood control structures and uncleared silt, officials said.
More than 800 people have been killed in monsoon-related accidents following the heavy June-to-September rains across India.
Bihar officials said the death toll could climb further as many areas were inaccessible.

""The government is flexible for the talks with the rebels and they should come for talks with sincerity,"" the new prime minister said in his first press conference in Kathmandu.
""The rebels have betrayed in the past therefore they should come to the negotiation with sincerity and commitment,"" Deuba said, adding that ""we will formulate a common agenda of all political parties and try to bring the rebels to the peace talks.""
The Nepali government and the anti-government guerrillas held two rounds of peace talks in the past, but the guerrillas broke peace talks twice.
The first round of peace talks was held in August 2001 when Deuba was prime minister, who imposed state of emergency throughout the country in November 2001 to crush the guerrillas.
Nearly 10,000 Nepalese people have lost their lives since the anti-government insurgency broke out in the Himalayan kingdom in early 1996.

 The government says it will increase security to counter the threat by Maoists to close down 12 big industries starting tomorrow. The government announcement comes as the Maoists have called for the closure of the industries for an indefinite period. Speaking to the media at the Department of Information in the capital today, Minister for Information and Communication and government spokesperson Dr Mohammad Mohasin accused the Maoists of trying to create psychological terror among the people but he said the Maoists would not be successful. He also informed the media that the government has done its homework to provide security to the industries which have been called to close by the Maoists. Minister Mohasin said it is illogical for the Maoists to call for the closure of the industries because the trade unions representing the workers in the respective companies are against the closure. He also said closing down the industries does not help the welfare of the workers.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 16 Aug 04
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs representing the 12 industries which have been called to close their operations by the Maoists say they will be forced to close down unless the Maoists themselves retract their call. Expressing scepticism over the government's assurance that it will provide security to the entrepreneurs and their industries, they say they will have no alternative but to shut down unless the Maoist aligned trade union withdraws its demand to close the twelve industries. The entrepreneurs have argued that additional security and vigilance does not guarantee the safety of their workers and distributors. They say they are not so much concerned about their economic loss but are concerned about the loss of human lives if they were to defy the Maoists by not closing down their operations.
 Meanwhile, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries has said it has been calling on the government to find a political solution to the Maoists call for the closure of industries. The federation has said if the industries which have national and foreign investments were forced to close down; the government alone would stand to lose more than 10m rupees in revenue each day.
 Human rights organizations have meanwhile said they have been in contact with the trade union aligned to the Maoists and have said should they receive a green light from the government; they were willing to find a solution to the crisis.

Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)
Kathmandu, 20 January: Communist Party of Nepal (UML) said that the seven-party alliance will organize demonstrations in the Kathmandu Valley Friday [20 January] evening when the day-long curfew ends.
According to a statement issued here, secretary of joint agitation committee Rajendra Rasa Pandey asked party cadres to come to streets and defy the government's ban orders.
Such demonstrations have continued outside the Ring-road throughout the day, he said.
In an apparent attempt to disrupt the scheduled agitation of the alliance of seven political parties, the Nepali government announced to impose daytime curfew from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 pm [1245 gmt] on Friday.
The seven political-party alliance has scheduled to hold mass demonstration Friday in downtown Kathmandu in a bid to actively boycott the municipal polls to be held on Feb. 8.
Issuing a public notice, the Home Ministry imposed the curfew orders within the Ring-road in Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City and parts of Bhaktapur districts.
The ministry also asked the concerned authorities to make arrangements to bring government employees to their offices before the start of the curfew in order to give continuity to government services.
Nighttime curfew orders are already in effect in the capital since Tuesday.
The government has said these restrictions have been imposed in view of possible anti-government guerrillas infiltration in the parties' demonstrations with a motive to trigger violence.
The curfew orders came two days after several coordinated anti-government forces attacked in Kathmandu including on two police posts, killing 12 security men and injuring half a dozen others on Jan. 14.
The Nepali capital, Kathmandu Valley, comprises Kathmandu and Lalitpur cities in Kathmandu and Lalitpur districts.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 7 November
Kathmandu, 6 November: Various FM stations today disobeyed the government's sudden and verbal order to be present at the ministry at 3.00 p.m. [0915 gmt] According to a press release issued by the Save Independent Radio Movement (SIRM), the Ministry for Information and Communiciation today called all FM stations to be present at the ministry at 3.00 p.m. by calling them over phone an hour ahead. 
""The FM stations, fighting for free media status, disobeyed the order,"" the release stated, adding: ""We came to a conclusion that the government, which did not feel necessary even to send a formal letter for the meeting, acts are against the rule of law and free jurisdiction."" 
It also condemned the government acts of ""threatening"" different FM stations over telephone and warned the government not to repeat such actions again in future. The SIRM also expressed concern over the government's way of working - calling the FM stations one by one and giving orders verbally, forcing them to sign under pressure, seeking details of their programmes, and threatening that the ministry would close the FM stations if the ordinance is not followed. Two weeks ago, free radios held a national conference at Narayanghadh which had decided to defy the government's orders until the Supreme Court makes any concrete decision. The issue of whether the FM stations can air news or not is now sub-judice now. Government officials could not be contacted for their comments.

Appa, who like most Sherpas uses only one name, reached the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit at 5:45 a.m. local time (0000 GMT), said Purna Bhakta Tandulkar, chief of Nepal's Mountaineering Department in Katmandu.
The seasoned climber led a team of Western mountaineers and other Sherpa guides to the peak. Asian Trekking, the company that organized the expedition, said Appa and the others had safely descended from the summit and were expected to reach base camp Monday night.
Like most Sherpas, Appa grew up in the foothills of Everest, and began carrying equipment and supplies for trekkers and mountaineers at an early age.
Appa first climbed Everest in 1989 with a New Zealand team led by experienced climber Rob Hall, one of eight mountaineers who died during a storm in 1996 when approaching the summit.
Sherpas were mostly yak herders and traders living in the Himalayas until Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for foreign mountaineers.
Meanwhile, dozens of climbers and their Sherpa guides scaled the peak over the weekend, becoming the first to reach the summit this year.
Nearly 150 climbers and their guides are on the mountain to try their luck before this year's spring climbing season ends later this month.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, more than 1,300 people have climbed the mountain's peak. About 175 climbers have died on its unpredictable slopes.

    The Small Heaven Boarding School is owned by Umesh Shrestha,  president of the Private and Boarding Schools' Organization of  Nepal (PABSON), an umbrella organization of private schools across the country.
    ""Overpowering the security guards, the rebels bombed the  administrative bloc of the building and torched the school bus,"" a local police officer told reporters.
    Property worth over 3 million Nepali rupees (42,857 US dollars) was destroyed in the blast, the officer said on condition of  anonymity.
    The PABSON condemned the attack and has asked the government to immediately compensate the school for the damage. Earlier, asking  schools to stay open, the government has assured private schools  that it would provide compensation to them if damaged by the  insurgents.
    The attack followed a student wing of the guerrillas called to  close all private schools from April 14, the beginning of Nepal's  new academic calendar.
    After the call, the student union has attacked a dozen of  schools across the country for defying its shutdown order, which  demands nationalization of all private schools nationwide,  accusing them of being profit-driven.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said the deadly disease, which is also known as Kala Azar and is transmitted by the female sandfly, had ravaged the town of Bura about 650 kilometers (405 miles) north of the capital since late November.
""Approximatively 150 people, mainly children up to 12 years old, have died from Kala Azar since last November in Bura,"" said Ioanna Pertsinibou an official with MSF Greece in Addis Ababa.
""It is too much for a population of approximatively 6,000 people,"" she said, adding that the outbreak had not yet been contained and could be spreading throughout the Amhara region where Bura is located.
""We are still diagnosing new cases, also in other parts of Amhara region,"" Pertsinibou said, adding that since May, 231 people had been treated for the disease.
She noted that visceral leishmaniasis had not appeared in the area before and that patients not treated usually die within six months of acquiring it.
Visceral leishmaniasis usually manifests itself in patients with fever, weight loss, an enlarged spleen and liver and attacks the immune system.
About 500,000 cases of the disease are diagnosed each year, more than 90 percent of which are found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil, according to the World Health Organization.

Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 15 August: A group of editors of Nepal's national newspapers, magazines and television set up an alliance to fight what they called a ""concerted and deliberate"" attack on press freedom.
The Editors' Alliance said on Wednesday that they have come together because they saw a sinister pattern of intimidation and threats against journalists from Maoist-affiliated organizations.
""We didn't have such a serious attack on press freedom even during the direct censorship of media after the king's coup in February 2005,"" said the Alliance in a statement.
""We ask the Maoist leadership, including Information Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara, to honour its stated commitment to protect press freedom and not to incite attacks on the media,"" the statement said.
The Alliance has also drawn the attention of UNMIN [UN Mission in Nepal] and the international community to these assaults and threats on the media and the impact this will have on the peace process and its potential to disrupt the environment for free and fair elections.
The Alliance comprises the editors of The Kathmandu Post ( Prateek Pradhan), Nepal Samacharpatra (Pushkar Lal Shrestha), Kantipur (Narayan Wagle), Image Channel (Vijay Panday), The Himalayan Times (Ram Pradhan), Nepal (Sudheer Sharma), Annapurna Post (Shree Acharya), Samaya (Yubaraj Ghimire), Himal Khabarpatrika (Shiva Gaunle) and Nepali Times (Kunda Dixit).

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 14 April
Arghakhanchi [district in western Nepal], 13 April: Members of the general public surrounded the Maoist party office after it obstructed development and construction work.
People surrounded the Maoist office after the latter prevented the earth work for the construction of three kilometres of motorable road in Khanchikot Village Development Committee. The Maoists stopped the work, stating that members of the general public had failed to do their bidding.
Members of the general public come out in opposition after the Maoists warned that they would break the limbs of, kill or take physical action against anyone starting work on the road without permission from the Maoists.
The road was surveyed by the district development committee in the month of Magh [mid-January to mid-February] and handed over to the users' committee.

During last week's swearing-in ceremony, which was broadcast live by several national television stations, Vice President Paramananda Jha took the oath in Hindi, while the new president spoke in Nepali.
The move led to street protests in the capital, Katmandu, and other cities. Demonstrators called for Jha to publicly apologize and retake the pledge.
The lawsuit was filed by Bal Krishna Newpane, a Supreme Court lawyer considered an expert on constitutional law. He is demanding that Jha's oath be invalidated.
Jha has defended his action, saying it was an attempt to promote the inclusion of Hindi as an official language in Nepal.
Though Hindi is widely understood in Nepal, it is not an official language and elected officials are by law required to take their oath either in Nepali or their ethnic language, which in Jha's case is Maithali.
Court spokesman Hemanta Rawal said a preliminary hearing on the case was scheduled for Sunday.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 26 October
 Nepalgunj [southwest Nepal], 25 October: Nepalese and Indian nationals will be prevented from crossing the border between the two countries without identity documents.
 Carrying identity documents was made compulsory after the joint decision of India and Nepal. The arrangement came into force after Nepal agreed to the Indian proposal of border regulation for security reasons.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 26 Oct 05
For the first time the regulation will be enforced at Nepalgunj-Rupedia crossing point in southwest Nepal. The regulation will be implemented from November, the Home Ministry has notified concerned offices.
 The immigration office at Nepalgunj has already started preparations for the new arrangement. The chief of the immigration office, Dharma Raj Neupane, told journalists that preparations are being made for the new regulation. ""We have felt the need of additional manpower to implement the new arrangement,"" he said.
 India has been raising the issue of border control, saying that the Maoist insurgency in Nepal had threatened Indian security. The government approved this plan on 23 October. Once the regulation comes into force, anyone crossing the border will have to produce identity cards including citizenship certificate, passport, identity document issued by local government body, land ownership certificate or driving license.
 Nepalgunj transit point has been selected for the first implementation of the new arrangement. This will be enforced in other entry points soon.
 Those bearing Nepalese or Indian documents will be allowed cross-border movement. On this basis a record of the people crossing the border will be maintained, said Neupane.
 Terrorist intrusion and criminal activities are expected to come under control with the new arrangement. [Passage omitted: No record kept so far]
 Meanwhile, Nepal Sadbhavana [Goodwill] Party has protested the Home Ministry decision to keep the record of those crossing the border. ""Forty thousand people living in Nepal's southern plains have no citizenship and the arrangement will directly affect them,"" the party said.

Kathmandu, 1 July: Home Minister Krishna Sitaula has expressed confidence that the Maoist rebels would join the political mainstream this time despite slackness on their part in implementing agreements and understandings. ""There were several agreements from both sides including their (rebels') commitment to return seized property to the owners,"" Sitaula told the parliamentary State Affairs Committee (SAC).

Sitaula said the government has fully implemented the commitments and wanted the Maoists to do likewise. ""We have raised this issue during all the meetings with the Maoists,"" he said.  ""There have been several agreements at policy level but they are yet to reach the functional level.""
The home minister said the monitoring committee and peace committee were formed to ensure proper local level implementation of the agreements. He said the negotiating teams decided to initiate the process for formation of an interim government and settlement of arms simultaneously, fearing that working on these one by one would take six months or more. Sitaula said the foreign ministry is preparing a letter to the UN requesting its help for monitoring arms.

"1573",20045125,"Title: Mosque, Arab targets attacked in Nepal after 12 workers murdered in Iraq.rtf; Date: September 1, 2004 Wednesday 11:53 AM GMT; Text: Thousands of people rampaged through Kathmandu Wednesday, setting fire to a mosque and Arab targets and ransacking employment agencies after 12 Nepalese hostages were murdered in Iraq.
Two men were shot and slightly wounded by security guards when they tried to storm the Egyptian embassy, which represents Iraqi interests in the Himalayan kingdom, police and a doctor said.
The streets returned to normal after the government clamped an indefinite curfew and declared a national day of mourning Thursday for the victims of the worst hostage massacre in Iraq since the US-led invasion.
Demonstrators, some chanting ""Punish the Muslims!"", swept through Kathmandu early Wednesday, throwing stones and ransacking any targets with Arabic-language script.
Protesters climbed on top of and set fire to the Jama Masjid mosque, the largest shrine of the city's small Muslim minority, after pulling out its furniture and electrical equipment for a sidewalk bonfire.
Riot police used batons to push the crowd of some 5,000 people out of a sensitive central area which includes King Gyanendra's Narayanhity Palace, a police officer said.
The mosque suffered only minor damage but many of its contents were destroyed.
The protests erupted late Tuesday after news that the 12, who left the impoverished nation in search of jobs, were murdered by militants who abducted them about 10 days ago.
The kidnappers accused them of cooperating with US forces.
A mob made up mainly of youths broke windows of more than a dozen employment agencies blamed for sending Nepalese to Iraq and set fire to their vehicles, furniture and computers, police said.
An employee at Qatar Airways, one of the main airlines used by Nepalese seeking jobs in the Middle East, said dozens of angry people stormed into their premises and smashed furniture before setting the building on fire.
The employee estimated damage in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Many protesters also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, saying he should take responsibility for the failure to free the hostages.
The government had repeatedly stressed that Nepal, which is fighting a bloody Maoist rebellion, was not part of the US-led coalition in Iraq.
Deuba appealed for calm in an address to the nation Wednesday.
""The terrorists who committed this gruesome act don't have any religion or principles. I call upon all citizens of Nepal to have patience,"" he said.
""We made honest efforts to save them but the militants never spelt out their conditions,"" Deuba said. ""We are now trying our best to bring back the bodies of the victims.""
His government announced compensation of one million rupees (14,400 dollars) for the families of each of the 12 slain hostages, a major sum in the one of the world's poorest countries.
The Himalayan capital's skies were patrolled by army helicopters, which were last called out last week when Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the monarchy ordered a halt to traffic to and from the city of 1.5 million people.
Hindus make up more than 86 percent of the population in Nepal, the world's only officially Hindu state. But the kingdom has experienced little of the inter-religious violence that has scarred neighbouring India.
Muslims account for 3.8 percent of the 27 million population. Some 7.8 percent adhere to Buddhism in Nepal, which is the birthplace of the Buddha, with smaller religions comprising 2.2 percent.
Spontaneous protest strikes were called in the towns of Pokhara, Gorkha and Biratnagar with youths taking to the streets to stop vehicles.
A statement announcing the killings was posted on an Islamist website by an Al-Qaeda-linked group called the Army of Ansar al-Sunna.
It was accompanied by pictures of the grisly beheading of a blindfolded hostage, including one where his bloodied head was held up like a trophy by a hooded captor. A video showed the other Nepalese being shot.

"7436",20117352,"Title: Political blackmailing & brinkmanship.rtf; Date: May 11, 2011 Wednesday; Text: Nepal, May 11 -- The sudden U-turn on its official line of revolt by the UCPN (Maoist) must have pleasantly surprised many, giving them the hope of a new beginning in the troubled transitional politics in the country, but to their dismay, the party's ""tactical shift"" failed to impress others and bring about any fundamental change in the political landscape.
With the constitution drafting deadline just two weeks away, the cacophony of the country's contentious politics has suddenly taken the form of deafening silence, even as the dark clouds of pessimism and uncertainty hover across the Nepali political sky. Not that the political parties don't feel the urgency for talks, but none of them is serious, for taking initiatives for that would only weaken its bargaining position. As the crisis peaks, the politicians are preparing to raise their stakes in the power politics and form new political equations by resorting to brinkmanship and blackmailing. After all, politics is not about turning oneself into a pauper; it is all about power. End justifies the means.
DUEL FOR POWER & BRINKMANSHIP
Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal's switching over to the line of revolt in November and swinging back to the line of peace in April only throw light on the dual character he constructed for himself for self-aggrandizement. Last November, Dahal tried to cut his arch rival Vice-Chairman Dr Baburam Bhattarai down to size, though unsuccessfully, and consolidate his organizational hold on the party by setting Senior Vice-Chairman Mohan Baidya against Bhattarai. And last April, he got the support of Bhattarai to overturn the mandate of the Palungtar plenum - making preparation for revolt to capture state power.
With the feeling of a badly cheated person, Baidya, the leader of the hard-line camp, is now groping for a political direction, while Bhattarai, who leads the moderates, now looks a bit comfortable in the party. But the tricky question is: How will his relations with Dahal unfold, and its implications on the peace process? Though Bhattarai was forced to join hands with Dahal to salvage the line of peace, he is likely to keep intact his tactical alliance with a group of the Baidya faction to clip the wings of Dahal in times of necessity.
These intra-party tussles will have repercussions on the power politics outside. The relations between Dahal and Bhattarai is likely to strain further as the names of both leaders will come to the fore as party's prime ministerial candidates for a national unity government. If Baidya group supports Bhattarai, the latter will have a chance to head the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Madhes-based parties. But the moves of the hard-line faction and the subsequent responses from Dahal are yet to be seen. Dahal would make all the possible moves to prevent Bhattarai from becoming the prime minister, creating ripples inside and outside the party.
It is sad to note that all the major political actors in Nepal have mastered the art and craft of blackmailing in their quest for power, but it is also true that they are familiar with the politics of survival.
On the other, what is the chance of Dahal becoming the prime minister? Not much. Not until the integration process of the PLA moves ahead and reaches an ""irreversible stage"" so that the Maoists could no longer use the issue as a bargaining chip. But Dahal is not a man to give up hope so easily. In fact he has been desperately waiting for the looming constitutional crisis in May when the parties would be forced to make some sorts of political arrangements, paving the way for a new power equation.
In fact, he has already told the parties about his ""bold decision"" that has made it possible to materialize the much-needed peace and stability in the country. And he has also, not surprisingly though, stopped launching vitriolic polemics against the ""parliamentary political parties"" which, in the words of the Maoists, represent the interests of the ""reactionaries"", both domestic and international. Dahal is trying hard to convince the other parties to let him become the prime minister after Jhalanath Khanal and he would agree to the preparation of a draft constitution and the ""regrouping"" of the PLA, but to no avail. He made a somewhat similar proposal while extending the CA term last year, but that failed to impress others. The circumstances have not changed since then, and as the other parties have not responded to his proposal positively, he has his own method for blackmailing. He is confident that NC would not take the blame for dissolution of the CA by not supporting its extension. And his line is clear: Either the NC should back him to become the prime minister or he would let the Khanal-led coalition last indefinitely.
And what is Khanal's take on May 28? He is a man sitting under the sword of Damocles; he is a confused person. Accompanied by his superjumbo team of 30, he is currently participating in a meeting "

About 100 journalists pushed through a line of police officers who tried to stop them, saying that the demonstrators were violating a ban on public assemblies.
Baton-wielding riot police later arrested more than two dozen of the journalists and detained them at a local police station. It was not immediately clear if they would be charged.
""It was a peaceful protest. They had no right or reason to arrest and treat journalists like this,"" Rishi Dhamala of the Reporter's Club Nepal said while still in custody.
Journalist Gyanendra Khadka, a reporter for state-run Rastriya Samachar Samiti news agency, was killed at Melamchi village, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of the capital, Katmandu, on Sunday.
Police said they suspect the rebels were responsible for his killing. The assailants took Khadka to a field near a school where he taught part-time, tied his hands and slashed his throat.
A motive for the killing was not known. The rebels rarely claim, or comment on, their actions and have been in hiding since they broke off from a peace process last month and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.
The rebels, who say they're inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have sought since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.

"5468",20065633,"Title: Time running out for Nepal king_ analysts.rtf; Date: April 18, 2006 Tuesday 2:30 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's king must act quickly to defuse an increasingly volatile standoff in the insurgency-hit country after nearly two weeks of crippling anti-royal protests, analysts say.
A general strike called by opposition parties has closed the capital and sent prices soaring and, despite a government clampdown, massive protests against King Gyanendra have mushroomed across the troubled nation with at least five killed.
King Gyanendra, who grabbed total control after sacking the government 14 months ago, now faces stark choices, warned a senior Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""Our message is that you don't have a lot of time, you have to move and you have to talk to the (political) parties,"" the diplomat said.
""I think the situation is getting more and more precarious. The king has to engage the parties in open honest dialogue leading to the restoration of democracy,"" the senior diplomat told AFP.
In a message for Nepalese New Year last week the king again asked political parties to enter dialogue and reiterated an offer to hold national elections as soon as possible.
His speech was dismissed by the political parties, who vowed to continue their protests until full democracy is restored and the king's power curtailed.
They have called for a mass rally to held in the capital Thursday, marking the start of a third week of the strike.
The current protest movement is bigger than the 1990 democracy movement that first signalled the end of direct royal rule in Nepal, noted Japanese journalist Kiyoko Ogura who has lived in the kingdom for 13 years and written a book on the democracy movement.
But she saw no indication that the king would back down.
""I don't think that the king will step back, he will continue to keep his position. The only thing I can see is more confrontation,"" Ogura told AFP.
""In 1990, the movement was limited to Kathmandu valley and a few other towns, but these protests are much more widespread.""
The late king Birendra finally relinquished control and became a constitutional monarch in April 1990, after an estimated 300 people died.
An Indian foreign affairs expert was also doubtful his less popular brother would compromise.
""It would be a miracle if the king gave up power. The situation is likely to escalate,"" said Sukh Deo Muni, a professor from New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
""The king's next step may be to impose more control and repression,"" he said.
The information minister warned Monday this could well happen after the opposition launched an economic war on the royal family.
""There will come a time when the security situation will become untenable and we have our legal options,"" Shrish Shamshere Rana told AFP. 
One option would be to call a state of emergency, Rana said, which would ""suspend some rights of the people.""
He said the government believed the protests were aided by Maoist rebels who have waged a decade-long insurgency to topple the monarchy.
""This is not a democracy movement, this is a movement clearly to capture government,"" the minister said.
King Gyanendra ascended the throne in tragic circumstances after the 2001 massacre of most of the royal family by the crown prince. The country had already been wracked by years of political instability and the outbreak of a Maoist insurgency in 1996.
He repeatedly fell out with his politicians and, blaming their inability to tackle the Maoists and hold elections, seized full control in February 2005.
Kapil Shrestha, a Nepalese academic detained for the last 10 days, told AFP that while the majority want some form of monarchy they do not want King Gyanendra.
""Whether he likes it or not the country is heading towards a republic. People don't want to abolish the monarchy but he himself is hastening the process,"" said Shrestha, a professor of politics from Tribhuvan University.
However, despite the dire predictions, no one can be sure what the king's next move may be.
King Gyanendra met three former prime ministers Monday night as he sought a way out of the current crisis, officials said.
""We know what outcome we want, and we know what outcome we are working hard to get, but there are some unknowns and the king's future actions are still up in the air,"" the senior diplomat said.

 The agitating five parties tried to make the situation tense today also by chanting anti-constitutional slogans, pelting stones at the police, burning tires in busy streets, uprooting railings of pavements and damaging vehicles in various parts of the city, according to the Home Ministry. It also said that the police had used one tear-gas shell to control the situation. The police had restrained themselves, the ministry said and added that the protesters' claim that their programme would be peaceful has been proved fictitious.
Radio Nepal, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 3 Apr 04
Life was normal until 8.00 a.m. this morning local time in Kathmandu with vehicles running normally and shops opening as usual. It was after that the burning and destruction of vehicles, burning of tires, threatening and manhandling of people going about their business started . When the protesters started resorting to anarchy, shops started closing down and the number of vehicles came down. Shops in alleys, however, remained open and some vehicles including some motorcycles were seen in the streets.
 Clashes had taken place in various parts of the capital between local residents who arose spontaneously to oppose the agitation and protesters in several parts of the town including New Road, Bhotahity, Gaushala and Chabahil. The situation had come to normal after the intervention of security personnel. In Gaushala, a local resident had been beaten up which was followed by a clash between local residents and the protesters. The incident ended after three protesters were injured. The security personnel did not resort to using forces except during clashes between agitators and local residents . They however remained in high alert throughout the day, according to the press release issued by the Home Ministry.
 Sixteen vehicles have been damaged and burned today by the protesters in different parts of Kathmandu.  Omitted passage: vehicle numbers and places where they were damaged . The police had to use minor force to control the situation after the agitators burned down a police-beat post in Baneswor. Several police personnel including a woman police person have been hurt.
 His Majesty's Government has called on the protesting five parties to be alert about the possibility of Maoists infiltrating their movement. It has said that signs about their involvement are clear by the call made by the five parties on the Maoists to be involved in the agitation, the declaration made by Maoists to actively support the agitation and the intensification of violence and destruction in the course of the protest programmes. It is very likely that the movement is not going to be peaceful as announced by the five parties earlier.  Omitted passage: government calling on the parties to abide by the constitution while carrying out protest programmes .

The Maoists cadres in groups of three or four have also started collecting money from vehicles from different places along the local highways, reports said.
When asked about this, the Maoist district secretary Kripashwor admitted having started the donation campaign, but said that they have not forced anyone into forking out donations.

 Jhapa east Nepal , 6 April: UNHCR has asked secretaries at seven refugee camps in Jhapa and Morang east Nepal not to get involved in politics; the commission made the request Monday 5 April .
 A pamphlet distributed by officials of the UNHCR highlights the work and responsibilities of secretaries and directs camp refugees not to get involved in politics.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Apr 04
The pamphlet says refugees must respect the laws of the host country.
 The pamphlet expresses disappointment at the increasing rebel activities in the camps and says this could affect the repatriation process; it asks secretaries not to get involved in politics and to restore law and order in the camps.
 Note: Unrest in the camps spread after the repatriation process was obstructed in February this year following differences between Nepal and Bhutan. Nearly 100,000 refugees have been living in the UNHCR-administered camps for over 13 years. The Commission has warned aid could dry up if Nepal and Bhutan do not resolve the refugee issue.

 There is talk of a new shift in the balance of power. This started after Maoists launched a night attack on an Armed Police base camp in Kusum, Banke District. It was the biggest Maoist attack since the last peace talks between the government and the Maoists broke down.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 14 Oct 03 p4
When previous talks broke down and Maoists launched a similar attack on the army barracks in Dang, they came out ""successful"". But this time, they had to face a ""disgraceful defeat"" this time. They lost 53 lives, against three on the police side , and instead of looting arms and ammunition they lost their own.
 Immediately after the Kusum incident, 25 Maoists and 12 armed police personnel lost their lives in Bhaluwang. Even this was not encouraging for the Maoists. They did exhibit their high spirits in Kusum, what with the time they had bought for preparations by announcing a unilateral ceasefire during the Dashain festival . But the outcome was not only one of despair, but also a serious lesson for them.
 In fact, the one and a half months since the last cease-fire has passed in a different manner. The nature of the Maoist People's War has changed and the outcome too has been the opposite of what was anticipated.
 There is no doubt that the seven to eight months of cease-fire during the Maoist-government dialogue was used by Maoists for preparations. There was widespread fear among common people and even the security forces that the preparations would produce something awesome. But that did not happen, and they appeared ""weak"" instead. Their war was not against the armed forces during this period, and when they did confront them, they proved unsuccessful. They did not attack any army camps, destroy any police camps nor seize any district headquarters.
 Not that the destruction of life is a good thing. Neither is it bad if the change in the nature of attacks was forced by a strong military force on the government's side. There is no way a war is going to end without one of the sides growing weaker. People want an end to this war, no matter what.
 What is more harmful is the direction which the series of Maoist attacks is taking. Many of their past activities have shown that they appear to be utterly involved in murdering civilians. There was a surge in the murder, abduction and threatening of common villagers, hapless teachers, journalists, small businessmen and local political workers during this period. Many have been murdered for just hesitating to pay forced donations or holding a different political viewpoint.
 The political parties agitating against regression i.e. for the restoration of an elected government , who the Maoists have dubbed ""friendly forces"", also find their political workers are increasingly being murdered or kidnapped. Very recently, district leader of the Nepali Congress and former State Minister for Home Mahendra Yadav and central president of the student wing of the UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) Rajendra Rai are known to have been abducted. Numerous such incidents at the local level are not reported.
 The series of incidents shows that there is a growing possibility that Maoists are becoming isolated, weakening and abandoned by the people. It is imperative that everybody understands what happens when a political force cannot understand popular aspirations and its own exact status.

  The Prime Minister also said that a UN team would arrive shortly to monitor and supervise the arms issues. ""The arms management process would begin after the necessary dialogues with the UN team,"" he added. 
  Koirala said that the ruling Seven Party Alliance couldn't disarm itself by dissolving the Parliament until the Maoists' arms are managed.
  ""Once the arms are managed, the interim government will be formed and only then can the Maoists participate in the interim government"", the Kathmandu Post quoted PM Koirala as saying.
  Reiterating the Government's commitment to the peace process, Koirala said that no stone would be left unturned to ensure the success of the ongoing peace process.
  Koirala's reaction comes in the wake of Maoist leader Prachanda's remarks that Maoists would take to the streets, if needed.
  Koirala has been taking rest in his hometown. 
  Earlier there had been differences between the Nepal Government and the Maoists over the issue of UN's assistance in arms management. 
  But both parties, however, wrote separate letters last week, calling for wide-ranging UN assistance, including ceasefire and human rights monitoring.

The victims bought the liquor from a local distillery that illegally produced it from rice and millet, it said.

Laboratory tests were being carried out to determine what caused the deaths, he was quoted as saying.
Deaths from tainted alcohol are frequent in Nepalese villages, where locally made liquor is often mixed with banned methyl alcohol to make it stronger.

"4887",20064592,"Title: U.S. Embassy in Nepal Cancels Congressional Visit, Citing Protests.rtf; Date: April 13, 2006 Thursday; Text: Late Edition - Final
The United States Embassy on Wednesday announced the closing of its consular section here and canceled a Congressional delegation's visit this week. The moves came as a fourth Nepali was killed during pro-democracy protests in the south of the country, according to a political party that called for the demonstrations.
  Three others have been killed since Saturday, during what have been the most violent and sustained protests demanding the restoration of parliamentary rule in Nepal. King Gyanendra, who seized control of the government 14 months ago in a bid, he said, to crush a Maoist rebellion, is expected to address the nation on Friday.
The state-owned Nepal Television said Wednesday that 3,000 people had been arrested over the last week and that a third of them remained in custody. 
  Among those held by the police on Wednesday, under circumstances that remained a mystery, was an American doctor, Brian W. Cobb, who said he had been detained for six hours and released by the end of the evening. He had been treating injured demonstrators at a protest on Tuesday here in the capital where he said he had been beaten by the police. A police spokesman said Wednesday evening that he had no knowledge of the case. 
  Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, along with seven other members of Congress, was scheduled to visit Katmandu this week as part of a swing through the region. The American Embassy in a statement on Wednesday said the visit had been canceled ''due to ongoing violence, curfews and widespread insecurity.''
  The street protests have come in the face of government curfews in Katmandu and elsewhere since Saturday. 
  On Wednesday, the government took the unusual gesture of not imposing a curfew in the capital. At the same time, protests in the city were much calmer, as though the city had decided to take a breather. Markets were open. Cars and motorcycles drove past a few still warm embers of burned tires. 
  The coalition of seven political parties that called for the protests last week vowed Wednesday to carry on with their agitation. Both the party coalition and the Maoists, who have lately linked arms in a joint effort against the monarchy, also issued remarkably similar statements, urging state security forces to stop cooperating with King Gyanendra's government. 
  ''It's time to aim all the guns towards the feudal lords who think of the death of poor Nepalis as that of small insects,'' said the leader of the Maoists, who goes by Prachanda.

A decision was expected before Jan. 22, when the peacekeeping mission established in early 2007 was set to expire, Ian Martin, the U.N.'s chief official in Nepal, said before leaving for New York to brief the U.N. Security Council.
The communists, widely known as Maoists, signed a peace agreement with the government in 2006 and joined Parliament and the ruling coalition in 2007.
They withdrew their combatants and weapons to U.N.-monitored camps under the peace deal.
Nepal's government formally asked the United Nations last month to extend its mission by six months so that the peacekeepers could continue monitoring the thousands of former rebel fighters at the camps. The government also asked the mission to observe elections on April 10.
The fate of the fighters at the U.N. camps will be decided after the elections.

"349",20033237,"Title: Amid yet another crisis, Nepal still mourns slain king Birendra.rtf; Date: June 1, 2003 Sunday; Text: Two years after the massacre of the royal family, Nepalese are nostalgic for the more liberal approach of the late king Birendra as the kingdom sinks into a fresh political crisis under his brother and successor Gyanendra.
Kathmandu has seen the most open protests against the monarchy since the end of absolute royal rule in 1990 following Gyanendra's dissolution of the elected government last October.
The major political parties, which have organised a series of street demonstrations, were Sunday holding emergency talks after Lokendra Bahadur Chand, Gyanendra's chosen prime minister, resigned Friday after less than eight months in power.
""Had Birendra been alive, the present political crisis would not have arisen,"" said Bhakendra Kumar Gyanwali, a social worker.
""The major parties are now going to the streets with anti-monarchy slogans and are even talking of setting up a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy,"" he said.
""The late king was concerned about people's reactions, while present King Gyanendra's behaviour shows him to be aggressive and obstinate.""
Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were shot dead after dinner at their Kathmandu palace on June 1, 2001, by a drunken crown prince Dipendra, who turned the gun on himself.
An official report said the troubled heir of the Shah dynasty had been incensed by his parents' rejection of his desired fiancee.
Gyanendra, who was out of Kathmandu at the time, was crowned after Dipendra died of his wounds following a reign of several days from his hospital bed.
Birendra was revered over his two decades on the throne and his photographs still grace many homes. But Gyanendra, with his more forceful interventions into political life, has rattled many nerves in Nepal.
""The statements and actions of Gyanendra give strong credence to the widely held suspicion that he doesn't want to play second fiddle to any other institution or any other person,"" said Kapil Shrestha, a professor and member of the National Human Rights Commission.
""King Birendra remains a larger than life figure even two years after his brutal assassination. We miss him especially after experiencing two years under his brother,"" Shrestha said.
He said Gyanendra's model seemed to be not his slain brother but his late father king Mahendra, who ruled as an absolute monarch.
Gyanendra on October 4, 2002, dismissed elected prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent"", and one week later appointed Chand. No major party agreed to serve in the king-anointed government.
The king has taken an especially hands-on approach in dealing with a Maoist insurgency, which was launched in February 1996 with the aim of toppling the constitutional monarchy.
A ceasefire was reached with the rebels one month after Gyanendra took office but collapsed within four months, unleashing a cycle of violence that left thousands dead.
In January 2003, Chand's government reached a new truce with the rebels and the two sides have held two rounds of peace talks. Analysts feel it is too early to judge whether the current peace process is a success.
According to political sources here, Gyanendra on Friday gave the major parties a 72-hour deadline to agree on a new prime minister.
However, in a sign of the parties' unease towards Gyanendra, they have made clear their campaign to restore ""democracy"" has not been called off.
For many Nepalese, it was Birendra's gentle style they miss most.
""The late king was always smiling. He was inquisitive about any important issue,"" said Yadav Khanal, a tour operator.
""We still feel a great vacuum in this country.""

"2206",20044404,"Title: Nepal 's PM sets peace talks deadline for Maoist rebels.rtf; Date: November 25, 2004 Thursday 12:42 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's premier said Thursday his government is determined to press ahead with parliamentary elections as he set a January deadline for Maoist rebels to come to the peace talks table.
""When King Gyanendra constituted the present government under my prime ministership, we were given the mandate to hold elections peacefully after holding talks with the Maoists,"" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said.
But Deuba told reporters the government's patience with the rebels was running out and unless they agreed to peace talks by January 13, the process for holding elections would be set in motion.
Nepal has been without a parliament since November 2002 when Gyandendra dismissed Deuba as prime minister, branding him incompetent for failing to hold planned elections.
Deuba, who was reappointed prime minister by the king in June, had said in 2002 the deadly insurgency made it impossible to stage elections for the 205-member House of Representatives.
The rebels have been fighting to topple the monarchy and install a communist republic since 1996 in the impoverished kingdom sandwiched between China and India.
They have spurned repeated government offers for talks to end the conflict which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Since his reappointment as premier, Deuba has said repeatedly he would begin the election process even if the rebels failed to come to the negotiation table but this is the first time he has set a deadline.
The Maoists want elections for a new constituent assembly to redraft the constitution that ultimately would be aimed at establishing a communist state.
The Maoists have refused to talk to Deuba and say they only want to meet King Gyanendra who has declined to speak to the rebels.
Deuba renewed Thursday the government's offer to ""hold discussions on any subject that the Maoists have been raising and to solve the problem on the basis of national consensus.""
He added the government would provide full security for Maoist participants in talks.
The Maoists have threatened to sabotage any polls that are not held to elect a constituent assembly.
Deuba set no date for elections. The king had earlier told Deuba's government to start preparations for elections by mid-May.
The last peace talks collapsed in August 2003 over the rebels' demand for a constituent assembly, leading to an upsurge in violence.
Nepal's army said Thursday it had found the bodies of 25 Maoist rebels after a weekend battle in the country's remote far west.
But it added according to witness accounts as many as 300 more militants may have been killed or hurt in the raid by troops on a guerrilla camp.
The Maoists often carry away their injured or dead comrades on their backs from the battle sites.
The battle was the biggest since the end of a nine-day truce last month observed by both sides to mark a major Hindu festival.

"890",20032019,"Title: 7 involved in Nepali armed police chief's murder_ report.rtf; Date: February 22, 2003, Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- A special task force of the anti- government guerrillas made up by seven people murdered the Nepali Armed Police Forces' inspector-general Krishna Mohan Shrestha last month, according to a report submitted by a probe team.
""There were seven persons involved in the assassination, four of them were directly involved in the killing while the other three played a key role in planning the cold-blooded murder,"" state-run English daily The Rising Nepal on Saturday quoted the report as saying.
According to the findings relying on the confession made by the murderers' leader Krishna Hari Sainju, who was arrested shortly after the killing, their murder was well planned after gaining much knowledge about the inspector-general's daily activities, the report said.
""The murder was a meticulously planned action and a part of the insurgents' declared plan of assassinating political, administrative and security personalities,"" it added.
Five murderers have already been arrested, including Sainju, the anti-government insurgents' commander of Bhaktapur district in the Kathmandu Valley.
However, Umesh Tamang and Juju Bhai, two gunmen who directly involved in the killing, are yet to be arrested. The police found these two absconding murderers have involved in several terrorist activities in the past.
A group of suspected anti-government insurgents shot dead Inspector-general Shrestha, his wife and a bodyguard on the spot from a close range on the ring-road of Kathmandu city on Jan. 26.
Shrestha is the highest-ranking police officer ever killed by the anti-government insurgents. He was appointed as inspector- general of the Nepali Armed Police Forces two years ago, when it was formed to combat the insurgents.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, is the founder of the Carter Center and the winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.
  A  COUNTERPRODUCTIVE Washington policy in recent years has been to boycott and punish political factions or governments that refuse to accept United States mandates. This policy makes difficult the possibility that such leaders might moderate their policies.
  Two notable examples are in Nepal and the Middle East. About 12 years ago, Maoist guerrillas took up arms in   an effort to  overthrow the monarchy and change the nation's political and social life. Although the United States declared the revolutionaries to be terrorists, the Carter Center agreed to help mediate among the three major factions: the royal family, the old-line political parties and  the Maoists. 
  In 2006, six months after the oppressive monarch was stripped of his powers, a cease-fire was signed. Maoist combatants laid down their arms and Nepalese troops agreed to remain in their barracks. Our center continued its involvement and nations  -- though not the United States -- and international organizations began working with all parties to reconcile the dispute and organize elections.  
  The Maoists are succeeding in achieving their major goals: abolishing the monarchy, establishing a democratic republic and ending discrimination against untouchables and others whose citizenship rights were historically abridged. After a surprising victory in the April 10 election, Maoists will play a major role in writing a constitution and governing for about two years. To the United States, they are still terrorists. 
  On the way home from monitoring the Nepalese election, I, my wife and my son went to Israel. My goal was to learn as much as possible to assist in the faltering peace initiative endorsed by President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although I knew that official United States policy was to boycott the government of Syria and leaders of Hamas, I did not receive any negative or cautionary messages about the trip, except that it might be dangerous to visit  Gaza.
  The Carter Center had monitored three Palestinian elections, including one for parliamentary seats in January 2006. Hamas had prevailed in several municipal contests, gained a reputation for effective and honest administration and did surprisingly well in the legislative race, displacing the ruling party, Fatah. As victors, Hamas  proposed a unity  government with Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah as president and offered to give key ministries to Fatah, including that of foreign affairs and finance. 
  Hamas had been declared a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, and the elected Palestinian government was forced to dissolve. Eventually, Hamas gained control of Gaza, and Fatah is ''governing'' the Israeli-dominated West Bank. Opinion polls show Hamas steadily gaining popularity. Since there can be no peace with Palestinians divided, we at the Carter Center believed it  important to explore conditions  allowing Hamas to  be brought peacefully back into the discussions. (A recent poll of Israelis, who are familiar with this history, showed 64 percent favored direct talks between Israel and Hamas.) 
  Similarly, Israel cannot gain peace with Syria unless the Golan Heights dispute is resolved. Here again, United States policy is to ostracize the Syrian government and prevent bilateral peace talks, contrary to the desire of high Israeli officials.
  We met with  Hamas leaders from Gaza, the West Bank and Syria, and after two days of intense discussions with one another they gave these official responses to our suggestions, intended  to enhance prospects for peace:
  Hamas will accept any agreement negotiated by Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel provided it is approved either in a Palestinian referendum or by an elected government. Hamas's  leader, Khaled Meshal,  has reconfirmed this, although some subordinates have denied it to the press.
  When the time comes, Hamas will accept the possibility of forming a nonpartisan professional government of technocrats to govern until the next elections can be held.
  Hamas will also disband its  militia in Gaza if a nonpartisan professional security force can be formed.
  Hamas will permit an Israeli soldier captured by Palestinian militants in 2006, Cpl.  Gilad Shalit,  to send a letter to his parents. If Israel agrees to a list of prisoners to be exchanged, and the first group is released, Corporal Shalit will be sent to Egypt, pending the final releases.
  Hamas will accept a mutual cease-fire in Gaza, with the expectation (not requirement) that this would later include the West Bank.
  Hamas will accept international control of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, provided the Egyptians and not the Israelis control closing the gates. 
  In addition, Syria's president, Bashir al-Assad, has expressed eagerness to begin negotiations with Israe"
"6185",2007606,"Title: Roundup_ Nepal marking World AIDS Day with theme _Take the Lead_ by Rajeeb Tamrakar Chen Qiaoyan.rtf; Date: December 1, 2007 Saturday 1:16 AM EST; Text: Various groups and organizations  in Nepal came together to mark the World AIDS Day Saturday with  the theme ""Take the Lead"".
    However, people were skeptical about the success of this theme  due to ongoing political deadlock in the country at the moment. 
    ""At the time when there is uncertainty about the entire  government leadership in the country, how can we expect them to  take the lead for some sick people?"" asked Sagar, one of the  participants at a program organized to mark the day at the  historical Basantapur Durbar Square.
    Like Sagar, scores of others expressed similar opinion as  leaders of major political parties are currently engaged in the  tug-of-war for power in the political scenario of the country.
    However, various organizations including non-governmental  organization Sarathi Nepal marked the World AIDS Day by  illuminating candles and organizing various programs in Kathmandu.
    Realizing that the government can not ""take the lead"" due to  current political limbo in the country, organizations like Sarathi Nepal, the community awareness team for drugs and HIV/AIDS, were  gearing up themselves to take the lead to address the issue of HIV/ AIDS in the country.
    According to Rabi Krishna Shrestha of Sarathi Nepal, they would continue to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS in their community  instead of looking up for help from the government sector only.
    He said that the problem with Nepali society was that people  tended to forget about the issue soon after the program was over.  Only a small section of people in the society were fully aware of  HIV/AIDS in the country, he said. 
    He said that although scores of people could be seen with red  ribbons in streets of Kathmandu, vary few really knew the meaning  of it. It was just a waste of time and money if those putting on  red ribbons went home and still continued to discriminate those  with HIV/AIDS living in their community.
    The red ribbon is an international symbol of AIDS awareness  that is worn by people all year round and particularly around  World AIDS Day to demonstrate care and concern about HIV and AIDS, and to remind others of the need for their support and commitment.
    According to UNAIDS, there are some nearly 40 million people  living with HIV throughout the world, among which approximately 2- 3.5 million people in South Asia are living with HIV and AIDS.
    In Nepal, while government statistics showed that there are 10, 321 HIV/AIDS patients (1553 with full blown AIDS), other  organizations have estimated that there could be 72,000 HIV/AIDS  patients in the country. 
    In his message on the occasion of this day, Dr. Padam Bahadur  Chand, Director of National AIDS and STD Control Center, said that the government was working to implement the commitments made to  ensure universal access to treatment and care for the HIV/AIDS  patients.
    According to him, there were AIDS Coordination Committees in  all of the 75 districts in the country. Through 16 centers, 1,296  patients were provided with anti-retroviral treatment, he said.

"3827",20052612,"Title: Nepal king sacks government, vows to restore democracy in three years.rtf; Date: February 1, 2005 Tuesday 8:22 AM GMT; Text: King Gyanendra dismissed Nepal's coalition government Tuesday and took charge of administering the country which is battling a Maoist revolt, as political leaders accused him of staging a coup.
""I have exercised the rights given to the crown under the present constitution and dissolved the government in the larger interests of the people,"" the king said in an address on nationwide television.
Gyanendra, who sacked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for the second time in two years, said he would head the new government and form a council of ministers.
He promised to, ""restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next three years.
""For the larger interest of the Nepalese general public, the nation and democracy and people's fundamentals rights, we have decided to form a new government under my own chairmanship.""
Opposition leaders said Gyanendra, who ascended the throne after a palace massacre in 2001, had staged a new coup.
Residents of Kathmandu, reached by telephone said outgoing landline telephone and mobile phone links were cut.
""The king has staged a coup and taken over the country's administration and other powers into his own hands,"" Sujata Koirala, leader of the women's wing of the Nepali Congress and daughter of a former prime minister, told AFP.
Troops and armed police patrolled the streets and surrounded the palace and other key sites such as government buildings.
State radio said the king had suspended some articles of the 1991 constitution but did not say which.
Several key leaders including those of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, the main partners in the former coalition government, were under house arrest, party sources said.
Security forces were barring entry to Deuba's residence, witnesses said.
The king accused political parties of ""indulging in factional fighting.""
""All the democratic forces and political leaders should have united to protect the country's democracy,"" Gyanendra said in his half-hour speech.
""Innocent children were found massacred and the government could not achieve any important and effective results. The crown traditionally is held responsible for the protection of national sovereignty, democracy and people's right to live peacefully,"" he said.
The king summoned Deuba for a meeting Monday night to discuss the ""current law-and-order situation and the proposed elections,"" a former cabinet minister and Deuba confidant told AFP.
Deuba had promised to hold long-postponed elections after the rebels, fighting to topple the monarchy and set up a communist republic, failed to respond to his mid-January ultimatum to agree to peace talks.
But he had yet to set a date and his coalition partners opposed holding elections before negotiations resumed with the rebels, who had vowed to sabotage the polls.
The Maoist conflict which has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996, has become increasingly bloody in the last couple of years.
The king first sacked Deuba in 2002 and branded him incompetent for failing to hold elections and fight the Maoist revolt. He also dissolved the parliament.
But Gyanendra recalled the veteran politician last year, ordering him to hold elections and resume talks with Maoists after international and domestic pressure grew on him to restore democracy.
Last week, the king of nearby Bhutan warned of a ""real threat"" that the Maoist revolt in Nepal could escalate out of control with negative implications India and his own tiny Himalayan kingdom.
""We sincerely hope ... some initiatives will be taken by the political parties in Nepal to resolve the Maoist problem,"" said King Jigme Singye Wangchuk.
Gyanendra became king in June 2001 after his brother King Birendra and most of the royal family were shot dead by the former crown prince, who was high on drink and drugs. The crown prince also killed himself.

"3078",20044312,"Title: Nepal army launches air, ground offensive against Maoist rebels.rtf; Date: August 11, 2004 Wednesday; Text: Nepal's armed forces launched ground and air raids Wednesday against remote Maoist rebel strongholds, an army official said, after the guerrillas threatened to encircle the capital and starve it of supplies.
Military planes and ground forces attacked far-flung rebel positions in the Maoist-dominated west and far northeast after dropping leaflets warning villagers to stay indoors, the official said.
""We have launched air and ground operations to crush the Maoists,"" the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.
He did not say how many troops were involved in the drive to flush out the rebels or whether there had been any military casualties. But he said five alleged guerrillas were killed ""in action"" in raids in the far west.
The rebels have been waging an increasingly deadly battle to topple the constitutional monarchy and install a communist republic. The uprising, launched in 1996, has so far claimed nearly 10,000 lives.
The Royal Nepalese Army launched the offensive after the rebels said they would seek to blockade Kathmandu and stop food and other goods from reaching the capital indefinitely from next week unless the government bows to their demands.
Those demands including punishment of army officials who allegedly violated human rights by killing Maoist activists, freedom for jailed comrades and information about missing guerrillas.
The rebels, who model themselves on Peru's Shining Path guerrillas, have told vehicles to stay off roads leading to the capital of the poverty-hit Himalayan nation from next Wednesday.
""Apart from encircling the capital, the Maoists are planning to attack in the far western and far eastern Nepal district over the next three months, and the army is getting fully prepared to crush them,"" the army official said.
Since the collapse of peace talks with the government last year, the Maoists have sought to blockade towns and villages, attacking vehicles and drivers who disobeyed their orders.
They have also sought to enforce numerous general strikes in the capital and rural areas, many of which observers say have been heeded as much out of fear of the rebels as support for their cause.
The Maoists control vast areas of countryside and also have a presence in Kathmandu.
The government has said it is ""prepared to go to any length"" to revive peace talks to end the increasingly bloody insurrection.

"279",20031678,"Title: Rhino Kills Villager in India Monsoon.rtf; Date: July 21, 2003 Monday; Text: Fierce flood waters washed a rhinoceros out of a national park into a nearby village, where the disoriented beast attacked and killed a young man, in monsoon rains that have killed more than 580 people in South Asia, police and relief officials said Monday.
More than 100 of this year's deaths in India have been in Assam state, home to the Kaziranga National Park, the world's only natural habitat for the rare one-horned rhino. Several animals fleeing floods in the reserve have been killed crossing highways or by running into poachers.
A full-grown rhino, swept out of the park by rushing waters on Thursday, landed on a riverbank in the village of Ghatupara in Darrang district, about 55 miles north of the state capital, Gauhati, police said.
""A villager gathering grass was passing by the area when the rhino charged at him and killed him,"" on Sunday, police officer P. Dahdhora said.
Four elephants with their handlers, and 10 forest guards hunted for the rhino as a funeral procession went through the village to bury the dead man, Qutubuddin Ahmad.
The death toll from rains, flooding, disease and panicked wildlife in the annual monsoon reached 585 across South Asia, officials said.
India has reported a total of 269 deaths, Bangladesh has reported 169, Pakistan 78, and Nepal 69, indicating that this year's casualties could be higher than usual. Last year, even with sparse and late monsoons in India, the death toll for all of South Asia was 1,000, with 25 million affected by the time the rains stopped in late August.
Four people, including two children, were driving in a tractor-towed farm cart when it fell Sunday into an overflowing drain near Jaipur, the capital district of India's Rajasthan state, the Press Trust of India said. Seven others on the cart were rescued by local villagers, PTI quoted police as saying of the incident Sunday. Elsewhere in the state, a teenage boy drowned in a canal, while lightning killed an old man.
Bhumidhar Barman, health minister in Assam, of which Gauhati is the capital, said 82 people had died of malaria in the northeastern state in the past two months and five of diarrhea in the past week.
Overflowing rivers in Assam have washed many people out of their homes, leaving them prey to insects, while floodwaters have polluted drinking water wells, increasing the cases of waterborne disease. A further 22 had died of drowning, he said.
Nearly 5 million people in almost 5,000 villages spread over 22 of Assam's 24 districts have been affected by the floods.
In eastern Bihar state, river levels appeared to be receding Monday as the strength of the downpours subsided. The flooding in Bihar has killed 13 people, but affected some 900,000 and destroyed $130,000 worth of crops, the state's Relief and Rehabilitation Department said Monday.

"7085",20082703,"Title: One road, two lives.rtf; Date: August 9, 2008 Saturday 2:50 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 9 -- You could say that Syed Wasif Haider ended up setting off bombs because of Kanpur's terrible power situation. Haider was 27 years of age in the winter of 2000. He worked as sales manager at American company Becton Dickinson was happily married to Kavita, a Hindu woman, and had two daughters - five-year-old Maria, and two-and-a-half-year-old Dania.
One morning, the power inverter broke down in this cosy home in the Humayun Bagh neighbourhood of Kanpur. Haider took the machine to Jilani Electronics near the Gulab Ghosi mosque. The Kashmiri owner introduced him to another person - Maulana Mumtaz, a signboard painter with a mesmerising personality.
Haider's life was about to change. Across the state lived another man of the same age - Syed Abdul Mobin, father of three daughters and two sons, with his wife Sumbul. He had studied Arabic and Unani medicine at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) after leaving his village in the Dumariyagunj district near the Nepal border. The police say he was also SIMI's first bomber.
Some thirty metres away from Jilani's repair shop where Haider had gone, is the cluttered and chaotic Parade Road. The story of SIMI, India's most dangerous militant religious movement, runs through it.
The meet that sounded the bugle
Almost a year back, on the evening of October 29, 1999, thousands of Muslim men - and about 150 women - had poured into the Halim College campus on Parade Road, roaring Islamic slogans. It was the beginning of a three-day SIMI conference that announced its assault on democratic, secular India.
At the congregation, seven-year-old Gulrez Siddiqui got on the stage and electrified the audience of some 20,000. He roared: ""Islam ka ghazi, butshikan/Mera sher, Osama bin Laden (The warrior of Islam, the slayer of idols/My lion, Osama bin Laden).""
Later, on a telephone line kept before the microphones, the voice of Sheikh Yaseen, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, reverberated through the awestruck gathering. He was making a live address, as was Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, and the imam of the Al-Aqsa mosque in Israel. Those present included Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, vice-chairman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.
Three Afghans walked around with green badges bordered with silver and gold. One of them, Ali Khan, admitted that he was a Talib from Kandahar. Kandahar was where all attention would shift to in two months. There were books and cassettes of speeches by Maulana Masood Azhar, who, unknown to all at the point, would be released on December 31, 1999 in the Afghan city after an eight-day Indian Airlines hijacking.
""It was all a shock for us. We realised they are developing international links. We distanced ourselves,"" says Haji Mohammed Salees, 51, who runs a hosiery shop and was at the congregation. Salees is rumoured to be a founding member of SIMI and was briefly arrested in 2001, but now writes in newspapers against the organisation.
We are sitting down the same road at another milestone of the SIMI story - Bhatia Restaurant, once a SIMI planning hub, where major operations were allegedly planned over tea and fried snacks. ""The road that SIMI was taking could never have helped Muslims,"" said Salees.
The Kandahar-Kanpur link
That road had started with a different destination in the first place. SIMI was founded with the aim of ""character development of students"". In many parts of Uttar Pradesh, priests went door to door asking parents to have their children join the Shaheen Force, the SIMI children's wing where they are taught basic tenets of Islam.
Its influence spread gradually. In 1984, priests were knocking at the door of the deeply religious Mohammed Farooq in Bachhawa village. Farooq promptly signed up his son Syed Abdul Mobin for the Shaheen Force. And then, Mobin headed for the AMU, the centre of SIMI's power.
By the 1990s, Mobin had completed a three-year course in Arabic language. He had also become a SIMI Ansar, with the task of moving door to door, motivating young Muslims. Haider, too, finished his Mathematics Honours - from the DBS College, Kanpur. Between 1994 and 1997, he worked as a sales representative with the Weighing Balance Company at first and UCB, a Belgian company, later.
Life was falling in place. He had broken tradition and married a Hindu woman, Kavita, who would convert and assume the new name of Mariam.
In 1995, Mobin travelled to Bhopal to attend the four-day All India Ansar Meet, where SIMI leaders openly talked about an armed struggle. Mobin, a young man who loved football, was ready to pick up grenades.
Thousands of kilometres away, in Afghanistan, the radical students' group Taliban assumed power in 1996. ""The corruption in SIMI came after the Taliban took over Afghanistan,"" says Salees, munching on a pakoda at Bhatia Restaurant. ""They thought, 'If they can do it there, we can also do it here'.""
For some time, Kanpur was indeed getting shades of Kand"
"1116",20032879,"Title: Nepalese govt appoints team for Maoist peace talks.rtf; Date: April 16, 2003 Wednesday; Text: The Nepalese government Wednesday announced it had formed a team to hold peace talks with Maoist rebels, state-run radio said.  The team is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal, it said.
Another member of the team, Telecommunications Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, said he hoped talks would begin immediately.
""The formation of the talk team has once again proved that the government is sincere,"" he said.
""His Majesty's government is committed to the ceasefire and to converting it into permanent peace.""
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire in January and have expressed a willingness to hold talks aimed at ending a six-year insurgency that has left more than 7,800 people dead.
A date for talks has not yet been set and the Maoists had criticised the government for the delay in forming their negotiating team.
The rebels announced their five-member team, headed by Babu Ram Bhattarai, in January, a day after the truce was announced.
The two sides had their first formal contact Sunday in a goodwill meeting.
The other members of the government team are Telecommunications Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, Health Minister Upendra Devkota, Physical Planning and Works Minister Narayan Singh Pun, Labour and Transport Management Minister Kamal Prasad Chaulagain and Women, Children and Social Welfare Minister Anuradha Koirala.
Bhattarai said he was delighted that the government had ""finally appointed a negotiating team.""
""We are pleased to hold peace dialogues with the negotiating team headed by Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal along with other five cabinet ministers,"" Bhattarai told journalists.
Previously the rebels had said they would only hold talks with King Gyanendra, because the government, which was appointed by the king after he sacked the elected prime minister, did not have a mandate for negotiations.
But Bhattarai said: ""We have not changed our stand but our expectation is to hold the dialogues. Since the ministers are appointed by the king, we have no objection to holding talks with them.""
""We will try to seek the opinion of all the political parties during the talks,"" he added.
Bhattarai said neither he or other rebel leaders had met the king or approached him for a meeting, but said they were prepared to see him at any time.
He claimed the talks would focus on the setting up of a round-table conference to discuss the formation of an all-party government and constituent assembly elections to redraft the constitution.

 After the long captivity, Kamal Neupane and the treasurer of the Nepal Journalists Association, Bhupendra Shahi contacted the Maoists in Channa of Bhawani village development committee (VDC) but they were sent back after being told by the contact that he did not know where Thapa was being held.

"4381",2006902,"Title: NEPAL IN TRANSITION.rtf; Date: December 21, 2006 Thursday 1:51 AM  EST; Text: Guwahati, Dec. 21 -- A new era has dawned in Nepal. The 238-year-old monarchy in the Himalayan nation is all but finished. The ruling seven-party alliance and Maoists recently finalised an interim Constitution that removes King Gyanendra as the head of the State. As per the new Constitution, King Gyanendra will only be a civilian king. The stage for this great transition was set when the Parliament and the Maoists joined their hands following a turbulent episode when Gyanendra tried to suppress the voice of the people by putting politicians behind bars. Gyanendra's autocratic rule and lack of vision have brought his own downfall. The king has now been reduced to a figurehead and placed, in many ways, on the level of ordinary man on the street. The Constitution would come into force after its endorsement by the Cabinet and the Pratinidhi Sabha. The powers, including those enjoyed by the head of the State, will now be enjoyed by the Prime Minister. The decision regarding the form of governance would emerge after the June 2007 polls to the Constituent Assembly. Questions remain, however, whether the ruling alliance and the Maoists, who will join the government, will be able to complement each other while taking the nation on the path of democracy.
  The latest developments do not augur too well for the peace process between the government and the Maoists. In fact, it is faced with a serious crisis. The Maoists are furious over the fact that the decision to appoint 14 ambassadors, including Nepali Congress leader Shailaja Acharya for the post in India, was taken without consulting them. They have already issued threats to walk out of the peace process. The violent protests staged over the last couple of days, albeit at local levels, were reminiscent of the days when rebels cut loose in their determined struggle to topple monarchy. Now, Maoist leader Prachanda has called two massive protests on December 31 and January 1. The Himalayan nation would start the new year through disturbing times. To prevent that from happening, the two pillars of the peace process must bury their differences now. Maoists should be involved in decision-making processes, but they must not adopt an aggressive stance and interfere in the functioning of the government all the time. The people of Nepal would not get the benefits of the transition if the two sides remain at loggerheads.
  One hopes these are only initial hiccups for a nation standing on the threshold of a new era. Nepal embracing democracy is a welcome development for the subcontinent. However, although Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh are witnessing a change, true democratic governance will take time to take shape in these nations. Like Nepal, Bhutan is also passing through a similar phase. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck recently handed over his responsibilities as monarch and head of State of Bhutan to crown prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. The King had announced last year that he would abdicate in 2008, when the country is scheduled to hold its first elections. The change has come earlier. Bangladesh too goes to polls next year. All these three nations are on the way to taste the fruits of democracy. But a country does not become a democracy overnight, nor democracy is about electoral politics alone. Democracy is a journey, a goal that takes a nation decades to accomplish. India serves the best example. Will our neighbours be able to sustain the new changes and go forward? Only time will tell. But it is in this area that India, ever willing to don the mantle of a big brother, can play a great role. It must help its neighbours to enjoy the fruits of democracy in the true sense of the term.

""The strike has affected over one million students in 5,500 schools and colleges in the Bagmati and Narayani zones which comprise 24 districts of the country's 75 districts,"" an education ministry official said.
The strike was called by the All Nepal National Independent Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) to demand the authorities reveal the fate of 152 students arrested after a ceasefire between the government and Maoist rebels broke down on August 27. They were arrested for ""Maoist activities.""
""We don't know whether they are still safe or killed by the security while in detention,"" a student source said.
The Private and Boarding School Association-Nepal (PABSON) said many institutions had decided to shut down for five days, fearing attacks if they stayed open.
Earlier this month the ANNISU-R enforced a three-day strike in eastern Nepal which closed hundreds of schools and colleges.
The union says it also wants the government to implement an agreement reached with it last year, including giving free education to all students until the age of 16.
More than 8,300 people have died in the nearly eight-year Maoist insurgency.

'The first phase talks will start Tuesday to generate goodwill on both sides,' Narayan Singh Pun, who is also minister of physical planning and works, told a public function at Pokhara in west Nepal.
It is not known where the talks will be held, although media reports have said underground rebel leader Baburam Bhattarai arrived in the capital Kathmandu on Friday.
Bhattarai is the convener of the rebels' talks team comprising top leaders of the outlawed Nepal Communist Party (Maoist).
On Jan. 29, the government reached a ceasefire with the rebels after they agreed to return to the negotiating table.
The rebels had announced what they said as a talks team comprising top leaders to negotiate from their side.
Though both sides signed codes of conduct to follow during the talks on March 13, the talks itself have yet to get under way.
At one stage the rebels charged that the government is not serious about creating an atmosphere conducive for the peace talks.
The rebels pushed forward their demand that their jailed workers should be set free, before any meaningful talks could start.
Fighting for an absolute communist state for Nepal, the rebels say their long-term aim is to 'empower' the people and that they want to write a new constitution for the Himalayan kingdom.
For the present, they want a roundtable conference, an interim government and election for a constituent assembly that would finally draw up the new constitution.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to abolish the constitutional monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal.
The armed rebellion has claimed the lives of more than 7,200 Nepalese on the government count. The unofficial count puts the toll at 10,000.

Normal life across the country has been affected on Thursday [6 April], the first day of the four-day long general strike called by the seven-party opposition alliance.
The alliance, which is protesting against the 1 February royal takeover of the last year called the general strike for the restoration of complete democracy in the country.
A few shops in interior parts of the city are open, but shops in major thoroughfares remained closed. Most of the public and private vehicles kept off the road. Educational institutions and other private institutions also remain closed.
Various trade unions and workers unions have expressed solidarity to the general strike of the seven political parties.
In his appeal made on the eve of the four-day long general strike, Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala has urged people to actively participate in the protest programme.
In his appeal Koirala said, ""I request my brothers and sisters from all walks of life to save the nation from injustice, violence, crisis and disaster by turning the mass movement into a grand success.""
Earlier, the Home Ministry had urged people not to take part in such protest programmes saying that there could be Maoist infiltration and opposition protests could turn violent.

Nepali forces dug up bodies of Maoist rebels and searched for scores of missing police officers on Monday after what appeared to have been one of the fiercest battles in an eight-year rebellion.
 The rebels' leader also vowed to continue raids on government targets despite a 12-hour gun battle in western Nepal in which, the army said, 500 guerrillas, 28 government troops and 4 civilians died.
 ''The armed attacks will continue until a progressive political solution has been reached,'' the rebel leader, Prachanda, said in a statement.
 The troops said they had found the bodies of 100 guerrillas. The Maoists, fighting to replace the monarchy with a Communist state, routinely carry their dead away from encounters, often burying them near rivers.
 Fifty-eight police and district officials were missing. There was no independent confirmation of the official tally. Both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and understate their own.
 If the official toll is true, it would be the deadliest single battle since the revolt began in 1996. More than 9,000 people, most of them rebels, have died.

The two-day strike starting Tuesday came a day after two senior opposition leaders spurned an invitation by King Gyanendra to meet for talks aimed at ending the political stalemate.
In the capital, Katmandu, hundreds of opposition supporters demanded that businesses close - demands that generally are heeded by proprietors for fear of vandalism. Universities and schools were also shut.
With no buses or domestic flights, thousands of passengers, including foreign visitors, were stranded.
International flights were departing on schedule from Nepal's only international airport in Katmandu. However, with no transportation available, some tourists had to walk the four kilometers (2.5 miles) between the capital's center and the airport, lugging their bags.
Authorities tightened security to prevent any violence at rallies scheduled later Tuesday, and hundreds of police were patrolling the main cities and highways of the country.
Nepal's five main political parties, which called the strike, said even government employees would be boycotting work in support of the strike.
Over the past month, the opposition has been stepping up a campaign to force the king to replace a monarchist government with one that would include members from all five parties.
The parties also want a say in who should succeed Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who resigned last week, and demand that the king give up executive powers he seized in 2002.
Tens of thousands of their supporters have taken to the streets to back their demands, and the demonstrations have often turned violent, leading to scores of injuries and arrests.
Gyanendra on Monday summoned the heads of Nepal's two largest political parties - Nepali Congress and United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal - for talks to end the crisis. But they refused, saying any discussions must include representatives of all five parties.
Unrest has roiled Nepal since Gyanendra ascended the throne in June 2001, after his brother King Birendra was gunned down in a massacre at the royal palace. The shooting was apparently carried out by Birendra's son, the crown prince, who then took his own life.
Gyanendra then assumed executive powers in 2002 and appointed a pro-monarchy government, after dissolving Parliament and firing then-Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who he accused of incompetence and of failing to end a communist insurgency.

 New Delhi, April 16 -- India, Bangladesh and Nepal are working towards the elimination of Kala-azar by 2010 for which the blue prints have already been made and appropriate IECs (Information, Education and Communication campaign), mapping epidemiology and others have also been undertaken.
  In an exclusive interview to Asian News International (ANI), Indian Council of Medical Research Director General Dr N K Ganguly said: ""The Government took a policy decision and in this direction (elimination of Kala-azar by 2010) ministers of three countries, Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed an agreement to work together"".
  Elimination of Kala-azar by 2010 is a goal under the National Health Policy, 2002, of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
  Kala-azar is presently controlled by using indoor residual spay like DDT and Malathion.
  Dr Ganguly said, ""We are working on some of the modalities on vector control. Like India uses DDT and Bangladesh uses Malathion.""
  ""This partnership will ultimately launch the elimination programme. The blue prints have been made and appropriate IECs (Information, Education and Communication campaign), mapping epidemiology and others have also been undertaken,"" he added.
  Further, Dr Ganguly said, ""A diagnostics test in which it could be tested, in the urine, whether the leishmania has been eliminated or not, also, has been put in place"".
  Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar, the fatal disease is predominantly found in the eastern India. Its early diagnosis being difficult and often the treatment resulting in resistance to the drug posed a major therapeutic challenge in combating the disease.
  Dr Gangly said, ""Kala-azar affects the poorest of the poor and now predominantly affects five states in India, mainly Bihar.""
  ""New drugs were not coming up and all available drugs were very toxic and showing resistance to the parasite and requiring hospitalization,"" he added.
  ICMR has developed an anti-leishmanial drug which showed success in 98 per cent of the cases.
  Dr Ganguly said, ""ICMR helped in development of an oral anti-leishmanial drug known as miltefosin. With this ICMR carried out up to phase IV trials and showed that this drug is effective in 98 percent of the cases"".
  High treatment costs necessitated the need for novel therapeutic approaches. ICMR is working with the Bharat Serum Institute to introduce cheaper alternative to liposomal amphotericin-B.
  Dr Ganguly said, ""Only effective drug was liposomal amphotericin-B which was very costly. At the moment, ICMR is working with the Bharat Serum Institute, Pune on another amphotericin preparation which is made by them, to be introduced as a cheaper alternate to liposomal amphotericin-B"".
  ICMR also helped in other known drugs which were later on used for leishmania. Dr Ganguly said, ""ICMR also helped Bill Gates Foundation and One World Health in other known drugs which were later on used for leishmania, known as Paramomycin as a backup drug"".
  Leishmania is caused by parasite (protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania) that lives in dogs, foxes, rodents, and humans and is transmitted by the bites of sand flies. It infects the white blood cells, thus reducing the defence system of the body.
  Poverty plays a major role in perpetuation of the disease. Contributing to this are malnutrition, illiteracy and poor housing. Further, the presence of peridomestic animal shelters around houses and vegetation facilitate breeding of sandfly vector.
  The more serious out of the two forms of leishmaniasis is Kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL affects the internal organs, causing fever, anemia, splenomegaly, and discoloration of the skin. Untreated, it can be fatal.
  ICMR's Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRI), Patna is engaged in research on Kala-azar with the aim of strengthening central activities based on three principles - active case finding, diagnosis and systematic treatment of infected individuals.

 Kathmandu, 6 June: Switzerland has offered to mediate between the government and CPN Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to resolve the conflict in the kingdom, agency reports said.  passage omitted
 The report, quoting a Foreign Ministry spokesman at the Swiss capital, Berne, said no date or venue had been set for a meeting between the two sides.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 7 Jun 04
Joerg Frieden, the country director of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the representative agency of the Swiss government in Nepal, told the Post that he was not aware of the development and was not in a position to comment. Even Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya said he was unaware of any such offer.
 On Saturday 5 June , during his first press conference after assuming the office of prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba said the government would not accept the mediation of the United Nations or other members of the international community to help resolve the Maoist insurgency.
 On 23 March, after a deadly Maoist attack on Beni, the district headquarters of Myagdi, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan had offered UN assistance in resolving the conflict if both the parties to the conflict agree. While major political parties and the Maoists welcomed the offer for mediation, deeming it necessary, the then Surya Bahadur Thapa government had rejected it.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 14 February
The former prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has said the Supreme Court's decision yesterday cancelling the legality of the Royal Commission for Corruption Control has restored the people's faith in the judiciary and the rule of law. He also said yesterday's verdict has increased the faith of the people in the courts.
Stating that he was very happy to be a free man after being imprisoned for 10 months on corruption charges, Deuba said the court's verdict had opened the doors for the democratic process to take shape. Talking to the press during a press conference at his residence in Kathmandu, Deuba said it was the duty of all Nepalese people to help in the restoration of peace and democracy. And he said he would be actively involved in the struggle for democracy.
Deuba was released from prison yesterday after the Supreme Court said the Royal Commission for Corruption Control set up by the king was illegal.
Deuba said non-violent protest to restore democracy would never be removed from history, and he expressed the view that the agitation by the seven opposition political parties was moving in the right direction. He also said that he would lend his support to the agitation by the opposition and follow its leadership. He expressed the view that he would never join the government on his own.
Starting that he had been accused of being the king's man for trying to bridge the gap between the king and the people, Deuba said he would now work with the seven opposition parties. Reiterating that he was always in favour of party unification [with the Nepali Congress], Deuba said he would start meeting senior leaders of the opposition. 
He also made it clear to the media that he had recommended postponing elections to the king at the suggestion of the political parties.
Stating that the Supreme Court verdict yesterday was a victory for all the people, he thanked the media, human rights groups and the international community for extending their support to him. 
In reference to a question from the media on whether he would agree to be prime minister again through the king's prerogative under Article 127 of the constitution, Deuba said no-one would make a fool of him again.

Text of editorial headlined ""Will the Maoists seize power and declare the country a people's republic?"" by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 13 October
The Maoists are an enigmatic party. The Maoist party's policies, programmes and strategies are not transparent. Whatever is known to the public is described as the party's immediate, mid-term and long-term tactics, which adds to the confusion of the general party workers, rival political parties and other classes of people. When the popularly elected and largest political party of the country, which is also leading the government, tries to hide its policy, strategies and tactics, one has to understand that something is wrong. Every political party works for power. When the party comes into power, the army, police, civil servants, teachers and doctors are under its control. It has control over all financial resources from internal and foreign sources. It can implement party policies and programmes with the utilization of the state fund. 
Therefore, holding on to power has become its priority. The Maoist party will benefit if it states its policies, programmes, strategies and tactics publicly. If it does that, it will have an opportunity to discontinue the policies and programmes that fail to serve the interests of the people. But there is a gap between what the Maoists say and do. What the party chairman is denying as the party policy is accepted by other leaders as the party policy. This is not legitimate. Therefore, people are finding it difficult to grasp the essence of the Maoist-led government and the Maoist party itself. The Western countries are also not comfortable with it because they evaluate a government on the grounds of the rule of law, good governance and transparency. 
The Maoists have been spreading rumours that tend to mislead the people and other political parties. Only the Maoists know the motive behind the propaganda of involving the Nepali Congress in the government, ensuring the victory of Madhav Kumar Nepal in the by-election and bringing him to the constituent assembly. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] may be unaware what the Maoists mean by that propaganda. The Maoist party may be planning to declare the nation a people's republic while throwing the bait of power to the opposition and rival parties. The recently held central committee meeting of the party supports this conspiracy theory. The political report presented by Mohan Baidya 'Kiran', a trusted leader of the party chairman Prachanda, states that it is the most appropriate time to declare the nation a people's republic. He says that his government would protect a grassroots level rebellion, instead of crushing it. People's power at the lower level and with the force of the state machinery, a people's republic could be established. In such a situation, other political parties including Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Madhesi People's Rights Forum will find themselves helpless. International examples are sufficient to clarify the difference between a democratic republic and a people's republic. We can look at the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The standard of living of the Taiwanese people cannot be compared with that of the Chinese people in terms of human development, prosperity, per capita income and freedom. 
The CPN-UML, which seems to have forgotten the Maoist betrayal during the constituent assembly election and presidential election, should remain alert about the Maoists. The Nepali Congress, which claims to have brought the Maoists to the political mainstream, should also remain cautious about it. If they let the Maoists go out of control, they will either have to face a communist dictatorship or a military dictatorship when trying to tame the Maoists with the help of foreign power centres. Both options are unacceptable to present-day civilized nations because that hold civil liberty hostage. Civil liberty is considered the highest right of humanity.

"1406",20043299,"Title: Amid Iraq hostage crisis, paper airs macabre photos of beheaded victims.rtf; Date: September 25, 2004 Saturday 10:27 AM GMT; Text: An Italian daily on Saturday published a series of grisly pictures of beheadings of hostages in Iraq and Pakistan, riding roughshod over the feelings of families and friends of the two young kidnapped Italian young aid workers, whose fate is still unknown.
Il Foglio carried around 40 colour photos, taken from the Internet, on its front and back pages, showing the recent decapitations of the US hostages Olin Eugene Armstrong and Nicholas Berg, as well as Daniel Pearl, killed in Pakistan in January 2002 and the execution of a group of Nepalese. Some images are particularly shocking, such as the severed head of Armstrong, with open eyes, resting on his body.
The paper justified the move, saying it was ""to protest against the indifference, passivity, ignorance and submission with which the politicians and the media, above all in Italy, are facing up to the religious war and the clash of civilisations going on in the world.""
Two Islamist web sites on Thursday announced that Simona Torretta and Simona Pari had been executed by their abductors but their families hope they are still alive as there has been no pictorial proof of their deaths.
Explaining the paper's decision to publish despite the sensitive situation, its director Guiliano Ferrara declared: ""It is necessary to look reality in the face, know one's enemy and his methods.""
A former spokesman of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and an editorial writer in the weekly Panorama, which belongs to Berlusconi, Ferrara also chairs a television debate programme on the private channel La 7.
Il Foglio, which has a circulation of 4,000, is an influential newspaper in political circles, closely read in ministries, embassies and by journalists.
Rome's prefect Achille Serra expressed his anxiety over the tensions that such moves could provoke and called for ""dialogue between religions to prevent possible acts of violence against Italian Muslims.""
Italy's Muslim community numbers around 800,000.
A forum is due to be held bringing together representatives of different faiths in Rome in the coming days although a date has not yet been fixed, the Corriere della Sera daily said Saturday.

The Fokker F-27 twin-engine aircraft went down on the outskirts of the city of Multan minutes after taking off for Lahore, spiraling in the air before it hit the ground and bursting into flames, witnesses said.
""All 41 passengers and four crew members on board the plane have died,"" said Iftikhar Babar, the district coordination officer for Multan, which lies about 400 miles southwest of the capital, Islamabad.
Malik Bashir, Pakistan International Airlines' station manager at Multan airport, said the cause of the crash was not yet known, but ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack on the state carrier's plane.
A PIA emergency department official who identified himself by a single name, Bashir, said the dead passengers were all Pakistani. They included two army brigadiers, two judges of the High Court in Lahore and the head of a state-run university in Multan.
A female flight attendant who was pulled alive from the plane's wreckage died later at a hospital, airline security official Mohammed Iqbal said.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf expressed grief over the crash and ordered an investigation to determine the cause, state-run Pakistan Television reported.
Grieving relatives waiting at the hospital wept in anguish and beat their chests.
Bashir said the flight took off normally for the flight to Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province. ""Whatever happened to it was after takeoff,"" he said.
Mohammed Nadeem, who lives near the crash site, said the plane was rotating sideways in the air before it hit the ground and went up in flames.
Another witness said the plane hit the ground with a huge thud and its wreckage caught fire.
""The plane begin to come down abruptly. Then it hit the ground. Then there were flames and dust,"" Arshad Gujjar said.
In August 1989, another PIA Fokker, with 54 people onboard, went down in northern Pakistan on a domestic flight. The plane's wreckage was never found.
In September 1992, a PIA Airbus A300 crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board. Investigators found the plane was flying 1,500 feet lower than it reported as it approached the Katmandu airport.

Talking to mediapersons at a press meet organised by Madhesi Journalists' Society in Nepalgunj, Shukla said promulgation of the draft constitution without incorporating the modality of federalism will not be acceptable to his party.
Alleging that the UCPN-M, NC and UML were making efforts to bring out an incomplete draft of the statute, Shukla warned that his party would hit the street if these parties made public the draft constitution without including a clear modality of the federalism in it.
""Our party will not agree on extension of the CA term if the draft constitution is brought out without encompassing the modality for federalism"", Shukla added.
Coming down heavily on the big three parties, he said they had weakened the issue of federalism by not giving it due attention.
Further on, Shukla held that his party wanted to divide the country on the basis of economic and administrative viability.
On the five-point deal struck before the CA tenure extension, Shukla accused the UCPN-M of dilly-dallying on its implementation.
He charged that the parties coupled with government apathy had stalled the peace and constitution-drafting processes.
The government has to bring the armed outfits active in the Tarai to mainstream politics through negotiations, not through confrontation, Shukla added.

"6271",20073705,"Title: Nepal politicians warn election may be postponed as political stalemate drags on.rtf; Date: October 4, 2007 Thursday 2:29 PM GMT; Text: Upcoming national elections may have to be postponed in this Himalayan nation, government officials warned Thursday, as leaders of Nepal's ruling parties struggled to end a political stalemate and draw the former Maoist rebels back into the government.
Mainstream party officials and the Maoists, who quit the government a few weeks ago, finished two days of talks Thursday without resolving the crisis that threatens to derail the Nov. 22 elections for the Constituent Assembly, which is to craft a new constitution and chart out Nepal's political future.
The parties and the Maoists agreed to meet again Friday at 7 a.m. just three hours before the deadline for filing nominations for the assembly elections.
""There's not much of a chance of reaching an agreement now, and if we can't we will most likely have to postpone the election,"" Chandra Prakash Mainali, an official of the United Left Front party, told reporters.
The Maoists had earlier given the government until midnight Thursday to agree to their demands, including the immediate abolition of the monarchy and procedural changes to the elections.
While mainstream leaders have said they want the monarchy abolished, disagreement over the procedural issues have kept the two sides to an impasse.
Few, if any, political leaders were optimistic about the talks, which were being held at the heavily guarded official compound of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
""The situation is very difficult. We are not close to any agreement to resolve the crisis,"" Prakash Sharan Mahat, a senior leader of Koirala's Nepali Congress party, said Thursday morning before the talks began.
Last week, the Nepal Congress, the country's leading party, announced its support for declaring the country a republic, moving the government closer to abolishing the monarchy that ruled for centuries. The king remains on the throne, but was stripped of nearly all his power last year in the wake of massive street protests.
But the ex-rebels insist the Constituent Assembly elections be based entirely on proportional representation, where voters cast ballots for political parties which in turn appoint members to the assembly.
Earlier this year, the Maoists had agreed to a mixed election system, where half the assembly members would be chosen through proportional representation, with the other half directly elected by the public.
Most analysts believe the rebels want a proportional election because they have few leaders of sufficient stature to earn many votes in a direct election.
The government, though, opposes an election based solely on proportional voting.
Nepal, which came to the brink of chaos last year before the king gave up power, again plunged into political crisis last month after the Maoists' pulled out of the government and announced plans to disrupt the assembly elections.
The Maoists, who fought a decade-long armed insurgency to abolish the monarchy, signed a peace agreement in 2006 and joined the government earlier this year. More than 13,000 people were killed in the fighting.

A brace from MMC striker Santosh Sahukhala and a goal each from Naresh KC and Sujal Shrestha steered MMC into the final for the fifth time.
MMC have won the title twice, while it still remains elusive for the hosts. They have never progressed beyond the semifinals in nine attempts.
MMC took an early lead as Sahukhala scored the opening goal collecting a rebound off Sahara goalkeeper Sagar Gurung in the 11th minute.
Sahukhala, the highest paid striker in domestic football, then doubled the lead in the 69th minute volleying home Ganesh Khadka's free-kick from 25 yards. Soon after the second goal, coach Bal Gopal Maharjan substituted Naresh KC for Sahukhala. Thirteen minutes later, in the 82nd minute KC calmly slotted the ball home from the box for MMC's third goal.
Having taken a 3-0 lead MMC players, though assured of victory with only few minutes remaining, did not stop flexing their muscles. Sujal Shrestha scored the fourth goal in a pass set by Bijay Gurung in the 87th minute to seal the match.
MMC kept the hosts under constant pressure throughout the game as Sahara's Uttam Gurung squandered a couple of chances to score. MMC custodian Bishal Shrestha denied Gurung a goal when he saved Gurung's free-kick that was headed toward the post. MMC custodian Shrestha was later adjudged the man of the match.
Sahara coach Kiran Shrestha said his team lost control of the game after the second goal. He added that the team failed to utilize some good scoring opportunities.

"6371",20072859,"Title: Nepal 's Parliament appears set to amend constitution to defuse southern protests.rtf; Date: March 9, 2007 Friday 5:15 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Parliament was set to vote Friday to amend the constitution to give people from the country's south a greater say, a response to deadly protests and strikes by ethnic minorities that have crippled the nation.
The proposed amendments include making electoral changes to allocate more seats in Parliament and guarantee places in the government to representatives of people from southern regions.
""The amendments are in line with what the prime minister had pledged in his public address,"" said Ananda Dhungana, chief whip of Nepali Congress, the largest party in government and Parliament.
""There will be discussions and debate on these proposals but we are all going to support them,"" said Dinanath Sharma, a legislator representing former Maoist rebels.
The amendments are expected to be adopted without any resistance. The ruling seven-party alliance and former communist rebels who are set to join the government soon and who have voiced their support for the amendments form the majority in Parliament.
Several ethnic minority rights groups have been protesting since January demanding greater rights and more autonomy for the southern region.
They temporarily suspended protests last month after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala announced the government would meet key demands. Violent protests between Jan. 19 and Feb. 8 left at least 21 people dead.
The main group organizing these protests Tarai People's Rights Forum decided to resume their protests, imposing transport and general strikes, accusing the government of failing to begin dialogue and initiatives to resolve their problems.
The transportation shutdown that began last week expanded into an indefinite general strike across southern Nepal this week which has closed some key highways, halted vital supplies from reaching northern cities, shuttered schools and left normally bustling markets deserted in south Nepal.
Maoist rebels fought the Nepalese government for a decade until a peace deal was signed last November. More than 13,000 people died in the fighting.
The Maoists joined Parliament earlier this year and are set to join an interim government soon.

In a statement sent to news organizations, the rebels said they were changing their strategy and would stop attacking Nepalese government buildings, telecommunications towers, national heritage and development works.
But the elusive rebel leader Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said the rebels would not allow organizations that are funded by ""American imperialists"" to operate in Nepal.
The rebels have been especially critical of Washington because it has provided the Nepalese government with millions of dollars in military and development aid.
The rebel leader also said they would stop killing individual Nepalese policemen and soldiers and instead give them a chance to leave the force. The rebels have shot and killed at least a dozen such people in Katmandu in the past few weeks.
They would also cease extorting money from people and instead impose a ""tax"" on businesses, Prachanda said.
The rebels pulled out of cease-fire with the government in August, and nearly 500 people have since died in fighting - which has further escalated over the past week.
Most U.S.-funded projects have already scaled back or withdrawn staff from the field, although there have not been any attacks reported on Americans in Nepal.
Last year, however, two off-duty Nepalese security guards at the American embassy were shot dead. The Maoists claimed responsibility.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. The government has labeled them terrorists.
More than 7,500 people have been killed since the insurgency began.

"1162",20032082,"Title: 2 policemen killed by anti-gov't guerrillas in central Nepal.rtf; Date: September 5, 2003, Friday; Text: KATHMANDU, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Two policemen were killed and another injured Thursday afternoon when a band of armed anti- government guerrillas struck a police station in central Nepal, the Radio Nepal reported Friday.
""The band of terrorists that had come in a strength of about 1, 000 set off a bomb at the Bayalbas-based police station in Sarlahi district, killing two policemen and injuring another,"" the state- run radio quoted an officer of the district police office as saying.
The police station, located some 25 kilometers north-east of the district headquarters, was completely destroyed in the blast, the officer said on condition of anonymity.
The guerrillas who had come on a private truck thoroughly looted the police station after attacking it, he added.
It is learnt that 18 police personnel, including a sub- inspector, were inside the police station at the time of the attack.
The anti-government guerrillas last Wednesday unilaterally declared the break down of cease-fire, which was announced by the two sides on Jan. 29 this year.
Security has been beefed up in various parts of Nepal and curfews have been imposed in at least 16 out of the country's 75 districts in view of the violent activities carried out by the guerrillas.

 Correction Appended
At least 26 rebel and government soldiers died Saturday in the deadliest single clash since peace talks collapsed in Nepal more than a year ago, a Nepalese military spokesman said.
 Col. Deepak Gurung, the chief spokesman for the Nepalese Army, said the fighting erupted when army forces attacked a rebel training and transit camp in Pandon, in far western Nepal, on Saturday. 
  ''Our boys put in an uphill assault,'' Colonel Gurung said. ''We captured the area.'' He said 16 Maoists and 10 government soldiers had died in the fighting. 
 But earlier in the day, another military spokesman said the fighting began when Maoists attacked an army patrol, Reuters reported.

An article on Monday about a battle between government soldiers and rebels in Nepal on Saturday misspelled the given name and military rank of the spokesman who described it. He is Dipak Gurung, not Deepak; his rank is brigadier general, not colonel.

Excerpt from editorial headlined ""Historic achievement"", carried by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 9 November
With the summit talks that concluded between the seven political parties and the CPN (Maoists) on Wednesday [8 November] morning, the country has embarked on the path of peace and the 11-year-long Maoist people's war has formally come to an end. With the signing of the letter of agreement by the top leaders of the seven parties and the Maoists, the country has an opportunity to transform itself. [passage omitted]
Although the decade-long conflict saw the sacrifice of more than 13,000 Nepali lives, it should not be forgotten that an opportunity has been gained to restructure the state. At the same time, all the parties involved must take to heart the commitment expressed by all seven parties to the 12-point understanding worked out between the seven political parties and the Maoists, the eight-point agreement, the 25-point code of conduct and the five-point letters of identical views sent to the United Nations. The fact that the country has entered a new era in accordance with the aspirations voiced by the people during the 19-day popular movement that followed the 12-point understanding is there for all to see. [passage omitted] 
That is why the seven political parties and the Maoists who have laid down arms to join the political mainstream as well as all the other parties should now focus their politics on national interest, the good of the people, democracy, freedom and human rights. [passage omitted] 
Otherwise, it another revolt in the country cannot be ruled out. A country which has suffered great losses in the pursuit of political incumbency cannot afford to put up with another revolt. If such a situation arises, the people of the 21st century will not remain silent.

Speaking at the event, organised by 'We Can' National Secretariat Nepal, chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee in the CA, Nilambar Acharya, stated that violence against women is a sensitive issue and requires collective efforts to address the problem.
Acharya further said the implementation of UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women is needed to end the violence. Nepal had ratified the convention in 1991. The campaign is adopted by more than 2,400 organisations in six countries, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
According to 'We Can' Secretariat, the campaign has succeeded in raising public awareness on bias, inequality and violence against women.
The programme was attended by delegates from 14 countries including Canada, Kenya, Uganda and South Asian countries. The foreign team also presented a cultural programme at the event.
""Representatives from all the countries vowed to work together to stamp out violence against women,"" said Sharada Pokharel, coordinator of 'We Can' Campaign National Alliance Secretariat, Nepal.
According to her, ending violence against women is a long process. ""Since it is related to behaviour and culture, the process needs more time and efforts"".
The campaign found that violence against women is rooted in gender inequality and whether at home or outside, it reflects the power structure in the society. The second phase of 'We Can' is aiming to build social cohesion and sustain the change achieved in the first phase.

 The second round of peace talks between government and Maoists could be held within a fortnight, sources close to the talks said. A four-member ""homework team"" consisting of two rebel and two government negotiators is expected to begin work Wednesday 30 April to decide the venue and date for the next round of negotiations.

Rebels did not say if demands for information on the whereabouts of central committee member Dandapani Neupane and release of politburo and central committee members Rabindra Shrestha and Bamdeb Cheerti within 15 days were pre-conditions for the next phase of talks.
 Maoists presented the demands in the first round of talks Sunday besides pressing for the abrogation of stiff anti-terrorist laws and the return of the army to the barracks.
 Human rights activist Padma Ratna Tuladhar said four facilitators appointed by the two warring sides have not received any letters of appointment. Tuladhar and former speaker Damannath Dhungana joined the talks two hours after it began Sunday without the letters and only on verbal invitation, Tuladhar said.
 Former Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhaya and former Chief Secretary Karma Dhoj Adhikari, government nominees, will join the second phase of the talks; they were nominated in their absence from the valley.
 Maoists presented a written 24-point demand as their formal agenda Sunday after scaling down a 40-point demand to then Home Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba more than seven years ago before going to the jungle to launch a People's War to topple monarchy and multi-party democracy.
 The formal Maoist agenda is silent on monarchy but its future could be decided in a referendum or a constituent assembly, rebel leaders said.

 Kathmandu, Sunday 25 April: The barbed wire fencing of the border between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China with Nepal (TARC) in the Upper Mustang region is expected to have an adverse ecological impact as it will restrict crucial wildlife movement.
 Bio-diversity surveyors of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) found that the Tibetan side had raised an eight-foot high barbed wire fence from the border pillars Nos. 20 to 27. The fencing is being carried out on two other pillars - up to No 29. The survey team has received information that the TARC authorities have plans to extend the fencing up to Damodar Kunda area towards the east.
The Rising Nepal, Kathmandu, in English 26 Apr 04
""The recent development at the border will bring critical changes in the wildlife profile of Upper Mustang in the long-run,"" says Madhu Chhetri, National Programme Manager of the KMTNC's Upper Mustang Biodiversity Conservation Project (UMBCP). According to him, the barrier would have negative impacts on the continued survival of different wildlife species since the resultant isolation is going to make their life difficult.
 Upper Mustang's ecologically fragile rangeland is the habitat of endangered predators such as snow leopard, lynx and brown bear. These Himalayan animals have for ages depended on trans-border movement for prey supply and safer home. Seasonal migration is a common strategy for survival.
 Wildlife experts warn that the artificially sealed wildlife corridor may put the species residing in the globe's highest habitat in a crisis. ""Border fencing is ecologically harmful though it has limited advantage to control the trans-border movement of livestock herders,"" says Chhetri.
 According to Chhetri, who led the survey team comprising his colleagues Ramji Acharya, Aita Man BK and Tenzing Gurung, Tibetan security officials have their own explanation regarding the necessity to fence the area. The officials said that the move was aimed at preventing the theft of goats and sheep across the border. The view was expressed during the visit of the CDO Chief District Officer from Jomsom north Nepal in June 2003.  Passage omitted: goats and sheep were stolen at night by the people of Upper Mustang; this place is rich in wildlife, names of endangered species

Everest 50 years ago, emergency services said.
The four experienced mountaineers, including a Nepalese Sherpa, told rescuers by radio that they had fought gales and driving snow to reach Plateau Hut on the flank of Mt. Cook.
Some of the party had suffered ""frostnip"" during their two-day ordeal, one of the climbers, Erin Hawke, told rescuers.
""We knew that you would find bodies if we had to stay another night,"" a Conservation Department spokesman reported Hawk as saying.
Rescuers had themselves been trapped at the foot of the mountain by the storm.
Hawke said the four climbers were tired and very happy to have reached the hut after sheltering for more than a day from the gales and snow just below the mountain's summit. The team got within 200 meters (660 feet) of the summit before turning back, the Conservation Department said.
Police earlier identified the four as Mt. Cook-based guide Phurenje Sherpa, 32, who climbed Everest in 1997; Conservation Department rangers Hawke, 34, and Rod Barker, 34; and Hermitage porter Rob Horsenail, 26, from England. Hawke was the only woman in the group.
They had planned to reach the 3,763-meter (12,349-foot) summit by midnight on Wednesday and return to the hut before dawn Thursday, Mt. Cook's Hermitage Hotel general manager Denis Callesen said.
Hawke said the group hadn't planned to camp out but were caught in ""arduous conditions.""
Conservation Department spokeswoman Shirley Slatter said the four could be trapped by the weather for another two days, but that they have enough food in the hut to last them.
Hillary, one of New Zealand's most famous citizens, was in Nepal to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Everest ascent with Nepalese sherpa Tenzing Norgay. He also was honored this week across New Zealand where sporting groups and communities took part in hill climbs, mass walks, galas and exhibitions.
Mt. Cook, also known by indigenous Maori as Aoraki (Cloud Piercer), has claimed about 100 climbers' lives in the past century.
Located in the rugged Southern Alps on South Island, it is 700 kilometers (440 miles) southwest of the capital, Wellington.

""The top leaders of the seven parties decided to postpone today's talks saying that they needed nore time to reach concensus on key political issues,"" Pradeep Gyawali, minister for tourism and a government negotiator, told AFP.
The two sides have been struggling to overcome differences on the role of the monarchy, what to do with rebel weapons and an interim constitution that would allow the rebels to join an interim government.
""We could not reach any conclusions,"" rebel number-two Baburam Bhatterai told AFP, but added that the peace talks were in no danger of foundering.
""Sunday's failure to reach any decision does not mean that talks are heading backwards,"" the rebel leader said.
The Maoists have said they will not return to war and Bhatterai vowed Sunday they would stay the course.
""Talks were positive and we will continue until we reach an agreement,"" he said.
Government negotiatior Gyawali said that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala would fix a new date for talks after consulting with other political leaders.
Sunday's postponement was understandable because of the seriousness of the issues at stake, a political analyst said.
""It is natural that it is taking time because the issues they are dealing with are very complicated and sensitive,"" said Kapil Shrestha, a political science professor from Nepal's Tribhuvan University.
In talks last week, the two sides agreed to hold elections by mid-2007 for a body that would rewrite the constitution and decide on whether the monarchy can stay.
But the main stumbling block appears to be what should become of the Maoist army.
The Maoists have said they are prepared to keep their 35,000-strong People's Liberation Army and weapons in camps supervised by the United Nations, but the multi-party government wants them to disarm.
The rebels, who control large swathes of Nepal's countryside, also want to see Nepal's 90,000-strong army confined to barracks in the run-up to the elections.
A ceasefire has been in effect for the past five months between the government and the rebels since massive street protests forced King Gyanendra to give up 14 months of absolute rule and restore parliament.

Sobhraj, known as ""the serpent"" because of his talent for disguise and escape, is thought to have killed at least 20 people in India, Thailand, Afghanistan, Turkey, Nepal, Iran and Hong Kong.
He was held for two decades in New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar prison, but deported without charge to his home country of France in 1997.
Sobhraj resurfaced in Nepal's capital of Katmandu last September. He was arrested at a posh casino there and charged with the killing of two Western backpackers, whose charred bodies were found on the outskirts of the capital in 1975.
On Monday, the Katmandu District Court was scheduled to wrap up the trial and issue a verdict.
However, Judge Bisowmbar Shrestha instead asked the police department to present original documents related to the case. It was not clear why the police had initially given only photo copies.
""The judge has postponed the final hearing for another day and asked the police to present the original documents,"" said Sanjeev Ghimire, Sobhraj's lawyer. ""This is only delaying the verdict on the case and my client will have to stay in custody for another few days.""
Sobhraj, 59, was born in Vietnam during French colonial rule, but claims French citizenship. He has admitted in the past to killing Western tourists but has never been convicted of murder.
He also faces charges of immigration violations for allegedly using a fake passport to enter Nepal in 1975.

Those intending to stand in the Nov. 22 poll must file their papers on Oct. 5 and a final list of candidates will be published Oct. 10, the commission said.
Nepal's chief election official Bhojraj Pokhrel said election symbols to be printed on ballot papers to ensure illiterate voters know how to select their chosen candidates will be allotted Oct. 11. About 52 percent of Nepal's population cannot read or write, according to government statistics.
""After that the candidates and parties will have about 49 days before the polling date for campaigning,"" said Pokhrel.

The poll comes in the wake of a peace deal last year between the government and former rebels. The former rebels communists joined Nepal's Parliament early this year and have lawmakers in a coalition interim government.
The Maoist rebels fought a decade-long insurgency to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy, but last year agreed to renounce their armed struggle and join the political mainstream.
The former rebels have since locked up their weapons in seven U.N.-monitored camps, and confined their fighters to 28 barracks.

Kalam, the architect of India's ballistic missile programme, and Charles met for about 40 minutes for talks officials described as ""cordial and constructive.""
Charles and Diana stayed in the palace during their six-day trip to India in February 1992 but there was talk of their marriage being on the rocks when sources reported the couple preferred separate bedrooms.
The couple divorced in December the same year.
Charles later Wedenesday addressed Indian scholars who have studied in Britain, saying the two countries shared a long history.
India was a colony of the British empire until its independence in 1947.
""This extraordinary bond has deep historic roots but is acutely modern in many of its manifestations and that modern relationship is driven by a healthy and shared perception that both countries have a lot to gain by building it further,"" he said.
""India and the United Kingdom are trading with each other and investing with each other as never before and I am told that bilateral trade grew by an astonishing 16 percent in the first six months of this year.
Charles flew in Tuesday on a nine-day trip to India that will include a tour of the desert cities of Jodhpur and Jaipur, where Diana deflected a kiss from Charles after a game of polo in 1992.
The previous trip ended disastrously when Charles left India for Nepal and Diana flew to the Indian city of Calcutta to meet Mother Teresa and then returned home alone.
His latest visit comes just after the release of the tell-all book, ""A Royal Duty"" by Diana's former butler Paul Burrell, which reveals details of her lovers' claims she thought somebody was plotting to kill her.
Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
Later Wednesday, Charles was to attend the restoration of a Mughal-built tomb and meet Tibetan refugees.

"1121",20032284,"Title: Rebels warn of _dark clouds_ hanging over Nepal peace process.rtf; Date: August 19, 2003 Tuesday; Text: NEPALGUNJ, Nepal, Aug 19 (AFP)- Maoist rebels warned on Tuesday that ""dark clouds"" loomed over Nepal's peace process, as they began a third day of talks with the government to discuss ways to end a civil war that has cost 7,800 lives in seven years.
""Dark clouds are casting over the current peace dialogue and this is not a good sign,"" Maoist chief negotiator Baburam Bhattarai said in a statement as a fresh upsurge of violence fuelled fears the peace process was unravelling.
Some 29 people were killed in skirmishes at the weekend between soldiers and rebels in the east of the country, police said. The bloodletting included a clash that left 17 rebels dead in Ramechhapt district.
But Bhattarai said the peace talks would continue.
""We want to give sufficient opportunity to the government team to (advise) how much refinement can be made to the official proposals,"" he said in reference to government offers of sweeping political reforms that the rebels rejected as insufficient.
The talks, the third round since a ceasefire was declared on January 29, have sputtered along since Sunday's opening session. At that session the government presented a political reform programme that included an all-party interim administration but rejected a key rebel demand for elections to a constituent assembly to redraft the country's basic law.
At a rain-curtailed session on Monday, both sides agreed to a six-point agenda for the talks, Communications and Information Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters on Tuesday.
""We are discussing the agenda and will continue the talks today,"" Thapa told reporters before boarding a helicopter in Nepalgunj, on the Indian border about 420 kilometres (260 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, for the talks venue at the village of Hapure in southwestern Dang district -- a rebel stronghold.
""We need time to take the government's agenda to the people and the civic society,"" he said, adding that the government team would seek a break in the talks Tuesday for consultations.
Government negotiator Prakash Chandra Lohani, the country's finance minister, conceded to AFP on Tuesday that there was room for compromise.
""There is sufficient scope for the refinement of the official proposals and we are desirous of continuing the peace dialogue for more days,"" he said.
Bhattarai confirmed in his statement that the main sticking points remained the issue of the constituent assembly and the future of the constitutional monarchy, which the rebels want dismantled to make way for a communist republic.
""The official working paper submitted to the Maoists (on Sunday) regards the constitutional monarchy as sacrosanct, whereas there is nothing in this world which is unchangeable,"" Bhattarai said.
""We have been demanding that the royal army should be restructured but the old regime has been ignoring it.""
Human rights group INSEC said on Tuesday a total of 76 people had been killed in armed clashes since the ceasefire was declared in January.
The militants have begun attacking army or police patrols once they move outside a zone five kilometres (three miles) from their barracks, which the Maoists claim is a breach of an agreement reached at the second round of talks on May 8.
A Maoist source told AFP on Tuesday the attacks were merely part of the ongoing civil war that the rebels have been waging since 1996.
""This should not seriously affect the peace efforts,"" the source said.
