"7748",20117448,"Title: Paths less traveled.rtf; Date: November 21, 2011 Monday; Text: Nepal, Nov. 21 -- Integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist ex-combatants has been one of the key sticking points in the Nepali peace process. The way integration and rehabilitation of ex-combatants will be handled and managed will have enduring long term effects, either positive or negative, on the future of the new republic. There has finally been a breakthrough over the contentious issue of Army integration and there is a broad consensus among the key political actors including a faction of UCPN (Maoist) that of the 19,006 PLA ex-combatants, a maximum of 6,500 will be integrated into Nepal Army; the remaining will be given an option of choosing between a rehabilitation package and volunteer retirement, with a lump retirement allowance between Rs 500,000 to Rs 800,000.
Generally, reintegration and rehabilitation of ex-combatants is carried out in two different contexts: either it follows a decisive military victory or a political settlement, as is the case in Nepal. In each context, rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants is a political as well as technical process, with a common universal objective of changing the identity of ex-combatants from rebels into civilian or state security actors. Concurrently, it calls for economic and social support and interventions. Reintegration and rehabilitation programs often clearly emphasize economic aspects such as providing vocational training and entrepreneur skills, but overlook the social aspects like family and community acceptance, psycho-social support and wider social reconciliation. If rehabilitation of the verified ex-combatants takes place in the near future, what could be the challenges in their transformation from ex-combatants into civilians? Will voluntary retirement without social support ensure their successful adjustment in the society?
Changing the identity of People's Liberation Army (PLA) combatants to civilians should be a central agenda of the rehabilitation program. However, it is a long-term and complicated process with strong economic as well as social dimensions, and calls for collective effort of ex-combatants, PLA, the families of ex-combatants and communities. Designing and delivering rehabilitation package like vocational skills and entrepreneurship training alone cannot guarantee successful rehabilitation. Many ex-combatants and their families will need long-term psycho-social support as well as facilitation and interventions to ease their relations with the people in the community with whom ex-combatants might have had a difficult relationship during the conflict. Social reconciliation is an imperative of rehabilitation. Lack of social reconciliation means the local community might harbor deep-seated grudges against the ex-combatants as the people who pose constant threat to public security. An environment not conducive to social reconciliation might prompt many ex-combatants not to choose the option of returning to their communities. For example, the majority of the Verified Late Recruits and Minors (VMLRs) have not had a comfortable transition from the cantonments to their communities in the face of deep social stigma and lack of trust between local communities and VMLRs.
Social acceptance of ex-combatants and their interaction and relationship with host communities will play an important role in identity transformation. Without community sensitization and reconciliation, psychological support, life skill development, and re-knitting of the social fabric torn during the conflict, ex-PLA soldiers will have an extremely difficult time to restart their lives as civilians. On the other hand, the communities that will have to receive returnee ex-combatants will be reluctant to accept the ex-fighters and to acknowledge their new identity unless communities benefit from wider rehabilitation program and have some sort of a say in the rehabilitation program. However, these issues have been marginalized in the ongoing debates over army integration and rehabilitation. Lack of deliberation on how to benefit as well as involve receiving communities in the rehabilitation program is a crucial issue that calls for a maximalist approach. A maximalist approach necessitates rehabilitation is linked to the post-conflict economic recovery and developments plan and strategies in ways that benefits all of the conflict affected people and places both individual ex-combatants and local communities at the centre of the rehabilitation program.
Creating job opportunities for rehabilitated ex-combatants is critically important to facilitate the process of new identity formation. However, in this sluggish economic environment, employment opportunities are rare and those available are stiffly competitive. Compared to public sector, the private sector will have a bigger role in creating employment opportunities for the PLA combatants. The private sector might have some reservations in hiring the ex-combatants who had seen it as 'class enemy' in th"

According to Dahal, Dambar Khanal was found in a house at J P Nagar, Bangalore, with his hands and legs tied. He was allegedly tortured by his captors who had fled the place before the police reached the house. Police said Khanal has problems speaking and relating to what happened to him.

""Inspiration should be drawn from the courage and foresight with which Bhutan has moved against elements within its borders that were threatening its own sovereignty as well as the security of India,"" Press Trust of India news agency quoted Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha as saying.
In December-January, Bhutan's military evicted nearly 3,000 Indian insurgents who had been operating for more than a decade from 30 camps in the jungles of the remote Himalayan kingdom. The crackdown followed six years of failed talks between the two sides.
""The bottom line in our relations with neighbors must remain the need to be sensitive to each other's security concerns and to neither encourage nor undertake any activity that might be detrimental to the security and welfare of the neighbor,"" Sinha said in a speech focusing on the future of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC.
SAARC, set up in 1985, comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal.
India accuses Pakistan and Bangladesh of supporting insurgent groups fighting separatist wars in India, a charge both countries deny.
India's relations with nuclear-armed rival Pakistan have been improving, with the latter promising not to allow any terrorist activity from its territory. India, in return, has agreed to hold talks aimed at settling a decades-old dispute over Kashmir, the cause of two of their three wars since they won independence from Britain in 1947.
Top bureaucrats of the hostile neighbors are scheduled to meet in the Pakistani capital later this month to prepare for talks on all major issues between the countries.

 Kathmandu, 29 November: Ministers representing the Communist Party of Nepal- (United Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] have suddenly expressed their disagreement over the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) ordinance, one and half months after the promulgation of the law. The ministers asked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to review the ordinance on Monday [29 November].

They made the request to the prime minister after the ordinance drew wide criticism from within and outside CPN-UML.
 Seven members of the cabinet led by Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari had handed over a memorandum to the prime minister prior to Monday's cabinet meeting.
 The ordinance gives powers to security officers to put a person in detention on suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities. Before the law came into force, a terrorist suspect could be detained only for 90 days [without trial ].
 ""In the past, the ministers had issued statements saying that they had rightly backed the ordinance.

A rebel statement demanded that all shops and schools close and traffic stay off the roads on September 27 and 28 in most of Nepal including the capital Kathmandu.
The statement said the strike would not affect celebrations of the five-day Kumari festival, which marks the start of the harvest.
But the strike's first day is a public holiday for the opening of the festival when the Kumari, a young girl worshipped as a goddess, is paraded by chariot through Kathmandu to a crowd of thousands including King Gyanendra and foreign tourists.
The king traditionally goes again to the goddess's temple to seek her blessings on the festival's final day.
""The Kumari festival is one of the most important events in Kathmandu and the strike during the festival will hurt the hotel and tourism industries,"" said Narendra Bajracharya, president of the Hotel Association of Nepal.
Tourism supports 1.25 million jobs in the cash-strapped country of Mount Everest.
The kingdom has already seen a tumultuous month, with riots on September 1 after the murder of 12 Nepalese workers by Islamic militants in Iraq which came on the heels of a week-long Maoist blockade against traffic entering or leaving Kathmandu.
The Maoists last week ended a one-month shutdown of 47 industries after the government released two top rebels and the companies opened talks on improving conditions for their workers.
""After a month of negotiation we were able to get the Maoist trade union to withdraw their industrial strike, but we're saddened that there is yet another strike,"" said Binod Bahadur Shrestha, president of the Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
The latest strike is to protest the killings by troops of two senior Maoists on September 3 in the southeastern Siraha district, said the statement signed by leading rebel commander Ram Bahadur Thapa.
The Maoists enjoy free rein in much of the kingdom. The civil war has claimed some 10,000 lives since 1996.

""We decided to refuse the king's offer for talks with just the two leaders. We will not break our alliance and will talk to the king only when it is all of us,"" said Madhav Kumar Nepal, leader of the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.
Only the heads of Nepal's two largest political parties - former Prime Minister Girijia Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress and Madhav Nepal, leader of United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, were invited to meet King Gyanendra.
The parties, whose ideologies differ dramatically, have insisted on keeping a united front in any meeting with the king to insure there is no split in their ranks.
The opposition wants to press its demand for a restoration of democracy - suspended by the king in 2002 - as well as a say in who should succeed Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a Gyanendra appointee who resigned last week amid massive protests demanding his ouster.
Nepal has been gripped by political turmoil since Gyanendra ascended the throne in June 2001, after his brother King Birendra was gunned down in a massacre at the royal palace. The shooting was apparently carried out by Birendra's son, the crown prince, who then took his own life.
The crisis deepened when Gyanendra assumed executive powers in 2002 and appointed a new government, after dissolving Parliament and firing then-Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who he accused of incompetence and of failing to end a communist insurgency.
The opposition claimed the king had overstepped his bounds as a constitutional monarch, and the campaign to restore democracy grew in size dramatically last month, with tens of thousands marching the streets despite a ban on public rallies. Some demonstrations turned violent and thousands of people were arrested.
The king's call for talks came on the eve of a two-day nationwide general strike backed by the five parties as part of their campaign for a new government.
Besides demanding a joint meeting, the parties have said they would only meet the monarch if discussions centered on him relinquishing his powers and installing a government with representatives from all five parties.
""The new government will be on the recommendation by the five parties and will have full executive powers,"" said Amik Sherchan of the People's Front party.

Police fired tear gas and charged the crowd with bamboo batons before opening fire with bullets, an official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.
The protesters were angry over the killing of a high school student during a strike last week in the town of Lahan, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of the capital Katmandu.
Pashupati Chaudhury, a doctor at Lahan Hospital, said two people had died and at least 10 others were in serious condition.
Local government administrator Chiranjivi Adhikari said a curfew had been re-imposed after it was lifted Monday morning.
The high school student was killed Friday when a strike called by groups claiming to be working for the rights of the people in the southern plain turned violent.
The death fueled protests that led to several vehicles and government buildings being set on fire over the weekend.
The violence came as the government held an emergency meeting of top political leaders in Katmandu on Monday to discuss the situation.
The root of the escalating violence in the area has been blamed on division between people living in mountainous areas and those in the southern plains.
People in the plains have long complained of discrimination, saying they have been left out of development and policy-making decisions.
The violence comes at a time when the peace process to end years of Maoist insurgency in Nepal is taking shape. The rebels entered mainstream politics by joining an interim parliament, and their fighters have begun to hand over weapons to U.N. arms monitors, leaving behind a decade of insurgency.

Police recovered 20 high powered gelatine sticks from a bag belonging to the suspected duo. A diary bearing affiliation to Marxist Lennist Maoist of Bhutan and an audio-video tape micro-cassette labelled as footage of some rioting incidents at Beldangi (refugee camp at Nepal for Bhutanese refugees) were also recovered. The second person identified as Prakash Adhikari,however, managed to flee. Though the arrested Bhujel claims to be from Nepal, police suspect that he is from Bhutan and was living in Nepal as a refugee. The other person who is absconding is also suspected to be a Bhutanese refugee. The gelatine sticks have been traced to one Santosh Rai from Rhenock who was arrested today. Police said Rai is working for hydel project companies and the explosives may have been pilfered from these companies and added that the explosives were meant to be taken outside Sikkim, possibly to Bhutan or Nepal.

Tension, doing time in the Central Jail for armed robbery and attempted murder, had managed to sneak out from the Bir Hospital, where he was sent for medical checkup with two security guards, on Wednesday.

The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR) also called for a government investigation into the violence in the south of the country, which has cast a shadow over the country's peace process.
Police ""failed to stop the violence when it broke out. They failed to protect those who came under attack, and they failed to carry out any arrests,"" the UNOHCHR representative in Kathmandu, Lena Sundh, said.
The violence on March 21 broke out when supporters of both the Mahadhesi People's Rights Forum (MJF), an ethnic activist group, and Maoists tried to stage a rally in the southern town of Gaur.
Clashes broke out, and the outnumbered Maoists were attacked by mobs of people armed with split bamboo poles and sticks. Most of the victims were beaten to death, and two Maoist supporters remain missing nearly a month after the attack, the UN report said.
The Maoists, who struck a peace deal with central government last year and ended their 10-year insurgency, have said that the attack on their supporters was premeditated, and involved armed groups from neighbouring India.
Maoists have also accused King Gyanendra and his supporters of backing the ethnic group in an effort to undermine the peace deal, which could see the country ditch the monarchy.
The UN found that hundreds of MJF supporters had armed themselves with lengths of split bamboo, prior to the clash with the former rebels.
""The OHCHR was not able to substantiate allegations that the killings themselves were pre-planned but this cannot be ruled out,"" Sundh told reporters at the release of a UN report into the killings.
Although the government has announced that it will investigate the killings, to date, little has been done to bring culprits to justice, Sundh said.
""A prime obligation of the state is to carry out immediate and thorough investigations into the killings,"" the rights official said.
At least 60 people have been killed in unrest since January in Nepal's southern plains region bordering India.
Home to around half of Nepal's population, the Terai region is known as the country's bread basket and has traditionally been under-represented in national politics.
Mahadhesi protests escalated in January after Maoist activists shot and killed an MJF supporter who was imposing a road blockade.

Some 1.9 million people are eligible to vote Wednesday in the controversial elections called by King Gyanendra, who seized government powers one year ago, ostensibly to tackle the country's decade-old communist insurgency.
As leader of his hand-picked government, the monarch has said he would also try to hold a parliamentary election by mid-April 2007.
Major political parties are staying away from the municipal elections, saying the king should first restore democracy.
Party leaders have held protest rallies and called strikes, arguing the elections would not help end the country's bloodletting and would lengthen the king's rule instead.
The government has responded by arresting and jailing protesters. Human rights groups say more than 3,000 party leaders, activists, human rights defenders and journalists have been detained across the country.
Maoist rebels have reinforced the political parties' bid to disrupt the polls, killing at least seven people -- three of them candidates -- in the run-up to the polls.
The rebels, having upped their attacks on government targets since ending their four-month cease-fire last month, have bombed houses of candidates and threatened to kill them during and after the polls.
To disrupt the municipal elections, the rebels have called a weeklong general strike across the country, which started Sunday.
The top rebel leader on Tuesday urged Nepalese people to stay away from Wednesday's vote, saying the municipal polls were a farce.
""Let us remember we are approaching the dawn of a democratic republic, and the feudal elements are definitely on the wane,"" Prachanda said in an appeal.
The elections are being held only in urban municipalities, leaving elections in more than 4,000 villages for a future date.
There was no candidacy in more than half of the 4,145 seats for mayor, deputy mayor and ward chairman in the 58 municipalities where the elections will be held, while many seats are uncontested with one candidate nominated.
Tejmuni Bajracharya, a spokesman for the election commission overseeing the vote, said at least 22 political parties along with a large number of independent candidates are contesting in Wednesday's elections.
Nine contestants are vying to become mayor of Kathmandu.
When nominations for that post opened, 14 people filed their papers, but five withdrew following intimidation by the insurgents. Most of the nine candidates remain closeted in security cordon of government quarters for fear of rebel attacks.
One of them, Prachanda Lal Shrestha, told Kyodo News he would provide better administrative services to the capital city if he is elected.
""I decided to contest because the main parties were unnecessarily critical of the king,"" he said at his house in a dark alley in the interior of Kathmandu, where he remains confined.
Shrestha, 63, chairman of the political party Save the Nation Nepal, said the municipal polls are vital for putting Nepal's derailed democracy back on track.
In the southwestern town of Tansen, which was ravaged by a rebel attack last week, a 25-year-old science student was elected mayor as he was the only person to file nomination papers.
The government's plan to put polling stations in 991 private schools for Wednesday's vote has met with opposition from school owners who say they fear retribution from the rebels. In Kathmandu, 32 private schools have revolted against the plan.
Officials say they are optimistic that the polls will pass off peacefully.
""The electorate is enthusiastic, they have been expressing their willingness to vote,"" said chief election commissioner Keshav Raj Rajbhandari.
""The polls would definitely had been better if all sides had cooperated,"" said Srish Rana, minister of state for information and communications, calling boycott moves unfortunate.
""The government has made adequate arrangements of security. The army and police will be out in force,"" said Rana, who is also spokesman for the Cabinet.

"6093",20073489,"Title: Dalai Lama _ Tibetans to hold referendum on new spiritual leadership.rtf; Date: November 27, 2007 Tuesday 4:49 PM GMT; Text: The Dalai Lama said Tuesday the Tibetan people will vote on a new system of leadership before he dies, as Tibetan Buddhists grapple with ways to prevent their spiritual leaders from falling under Chinese control.
For decades, the Dalai Lama has personified Tibetans' struggle for self-determination. But fears that China will appoint a new Dalai Lama after his death has led Tibetan leaders to contemplate breaking with the centuries-old system to choose their spiritual leader including doing away with Dalai Lamas or changing the system of his reincarnation
China, which accuses the Tibetan spiritual leader of seeking independence for Tibet, angrily condemned the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's proposal as a subversion of Buddhist tradition.
But the Dalai Lama said it was up to the Tibetan people to decide.
""If people feel that the institution of the Dalai Lama is still necessary, it will continue,"" he said in an interview with a small group of reporters on the sidelines of a gathering of world religious leaders in this northern Indian city.
The Dalai Lama said a referendum would be held among all traditional Tibetan Buddhists along the Himalayan range, including China, Nepal and India and into Mongolia, to determine what kind of leadership they want after his death.
""When my physical condition becomes weak, and there are serious preparations for death, then this event should happen,"" said the 72-year-old, adding ""according to my regular medical checkup I am good for another few decades.""
It was not immediately clear how such a vote would take place, particularly in areas under Chinese rule, where even his portrait is banned. However, some 80,000 Tibetans voted last year for their government in exile, which is based in India.
China, which has ruled Tibet with a heavy hand since its forces invaded in 1951, condemned the referendum proposal.
""The Dalai Lama's statement is in blatant violation of religious practice and historical procedure,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
For centuries, the search for the reincarnation of religious leaders, known as lamas and including the Dalai Lama has been carried out by Tibetan monks following the leaders' deaths.
Tibetans fear China will control the search for a successor once the Dalai Lama dies, further eroding the Himalayan region's unique Buddhist culture.
Those concerns were heightened in August when Beijing moved to tighten its grip over Tibetan Buddhism by asserting the officially atheistic communist government's sole right to recognize Buddhist reincarnations of the lamas that form the backbone of the religion's clergy.
Such fears were also stirred following the death in 1989 of the Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest ranking figure, who serves the ceremonial role of the Dalai Lama's teacher.
China refused to recognize a boy named by the Dalai Lama to be the 11th Panchen Lama, instead installing their own pick, Gyaltsen Norbu, now 16, in 1995. The boy recognized by the Dalai Lama, Gendun Choekyi Nyima, now 18, disappeared soon afterward and has reportedly been in Chinese custody ever since. China says he is living a normal life but has given no details.
The Dalai Lama said he expected China to do the same following his death. And the Tibetan leadership in exile has begun exploring several possible ways to prevent this.
First a referendum would be held to decide if Tibetan Buddhists want to continue with the Dalai Lama system. If they do, the Dalai Lama said he would either be reincarnated after his death outside China or he would choose a new Dalai Lama before he died.
""The very purpose of reincarnation is to carry out the tasks of the previous life that are not yet achieved,"" The Dalai Lama said. ""If I die while we are still refugees, my reincarnation, logically, will come outside Tibet, who will carry out the work I started.""
The spiritual leader also raised the possibility of naming a new Dalai Lama while he was still alive.
The Dalai Lama fended off criticism that this would be a break with Buddhist tradition, saying there was a precedent of one incarnation being named while the other was still alive.
The Dalai Lama said one of his teachers, the Lama Trogye Trichen, was recognized as a reincarnated lama while his predecessor was still alive.
Tibetan activists said the moves were forced by China.
""The Dalai Lama is speaking from a place where he is very aware of the restrictions, the repression in Tibet today and in particular the controls over reincarnate lamas which the Chinese authorities have imposed most recently,"" said Kate Saunders of the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet.
However, the Dalai Lama, acknowledged that the Tibetan exile leadership had not yet decided exactly what course to follow.

The campaign was inaugurated today at the square, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Punya Ratna Manandhar, chief of Alcoholic Recovering Voice- Nepal, said the move was aimed at maintaining decency at the major tourist attraction in Kathmandu.
""People have been found smoking cigarette, chewing tobacco, smoking cannabis and sniffing dendrite there,"" he said.
Drug abusers often loiter around temples, shrines and pagodas, causing panic among visitors.
The Durbar Square has already been declared no traffic zone.
The Drugs Control Section under the Ministry of Home Affairs has also expressed solidarity with the idea.
The organisations, which will be enforcing the ban, will deploy volunteers backed by police to keep vigil at the site.
Hari Kumar Shrestha, chief of Hanumandhoka Durbar Area Conservation Programme, welcomed the ban and said the curbs will help preserve the legacy of the historical and cultural site.
He called on parents to monitor children's activities and see to it that they are not doing drugs.

Kathmandu, 27 June: Eight military commanders of the Jay Krishna Goit-led Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) have decided to split from their mother party to form another breakaway faction.
The new central committee of the eight rebel commanders was formed under the leadership of ""Bisfot"" Singh stating that the Goit-led JTMM ""cannot liberate the Terai [southern plains]and its people"".
Talking to eKantipur on the phone, the head of the newly formed JTMM Singh said that they formally created the new group on 13 June. Singh claimed that each of their companies has 150 armed militants. He said ""the Goit leadership is obsessed in pursuit to gain personal benefits"".
The members of the new JTMM group include Jasu Yadav, Suya Narayan Yadav, Shree Yadav, Ghughali Yadav, Aasharam Yadav, Bam Bhola Singh and Dev Nath Yadav and Bishpot Singh.
The former chairman of the Madhesi Rastriya Mukti Morcha, a Maoists-wing, Jay Krishna Goit had parted ways with Prachanda's leadership and formed JTMM claiming that Maoists wouldn't do anything for the progress of the Madhesi people.
Goit formed the JTMM on 25 July 2004. However, later citing Goit's ""sickness"" as the factor, eastern division commander of the JTMM Jwala Singh had also formed a new faction on his own leadership in July last year.
Until the formation of Bishpot-led JTMM, the two Goit-led and Jwala Singh-led JTMM factions were undertaking an armed movement in Terai.

Accusing the party of launching ""atrocities"" against the Baidya faction, Gajurel said the decision of handing over keys of arms containers is a move toward disarming the Maoist combatants.

The group, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Krishna Jung Rayamajhi, appealed to the government and Maoists to agree to a truce in time for the annual 10-day Nepalese festival Dasain which starts Friday.
Dasain celebrates the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga who vanquished demons and saved humanity and is the scenic Himalayan kingdom's most popular festival.
""The commission appeals to the government and Maoist rebels to declare a ceasefire before the national festival Dasain,"" the group said in a statement.
The commission also includes human rights activist Padma Ratna Tuladhar,  banker Himalaya Shumshere Rana, ex-peace negotiator and former minister Narayan Singh Pun and pro-leftist journalist Shyan Shrestha.
Shrestha and Tuladhar are viewed as close confidants of the Maoists who have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and institute communist rule in an increasingly bloody battle that has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Activists of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Lenist (NCP-UML), the major ally in the four-party government headed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, have urged the government to declare a unilateral truce.
""It's sad ministers of the NCP-UML who are the major government ally have been unable to get a ceasefire declared in readiness for a peace dialogue,"" key central committee member Pradip Gyawali said.
Deuba was reappointed premier in June, nearly two years after King Gyanendra dismissed him branding him incompetent, to end the revolt that has deepened the impoverished kingdom's economic woes.
He has said his government wants peace and is waiting for the Maoists to reply to a recent offer of talks.
Bloodshed has risen since a peace dialogue collapsed in 2003 with around eight people dying in insurgency-related violence on average daily.
In the latest violence, at least three rebels were killed in a successful  raid in far western Nepal to rescue three security personnel from Maoist captivity Tuesday, the army said.

 It has come to light that Maoists deployed 800 militia from far western to eastern Nepal while talks were going on between the government and the rebels. The rebel militia were moved to the districts of Tehrathum, Panchthar, Taplejung and Sankhuwasabha in April this year via Dharan, Dhankuta and Hile.
 A member of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) told Spacetime that battalions and companies were deployed in eastern Nepal to reinforce the PLA strength there. They travelled in eight reserved buses from Holeri in Dang in the midwest in the third week of April.

The Royal Nepal Army barracks at Salleri in Dhankuta intercepted them and found only photographs of them with weapons. They even beat up Jas Bahadur Bista, alias Sandesh, company commander of the 18th Battalion ""A"" Company.
 The army released them when no weapons were found. They dispersed to districts in the region.
 Most were veterans of rebel attacks on Mangalsen, Dang, Jumla, Argakanchi and other places, they told Spacetime. They revealed this during a sudden and unplanned encounter with Spacetime at Heydangn Gadi, about two days' walk from the district headquarters of Sankhuwasabha Khadbari .

 Security sources at district headquarters said the government has received official confirmation of the movement. They did not confirm how many rebels had entered eastern Nepal.

The Maoists called the two-week blockade of 16 districts in western and southwestern Nepal last week to protest rebel disappearances they blame on government forces.
The Maoists have been seeking to block the movement of all forms of transport -- including bullock and mule carts.
The blockade came on top of a slew of general strikes called by the Maoists who are battling to install a communist republic in the impoverished kingdom.
The first army flight brought 41 passengers from Nepalgunj to Kathmandu on Wednesday, an official of Sneha travels Prakash Acharya told AFP.
The army aircraft are being used as other carriers cannot cope with the sharp increase in domestic air travellers, he said.
It was not immediately known how many army flights would be pressed into service or how many people were stranded.
Residents of some blockade-hit districts said people had resorted to bartering goods to get enough food.
""Our people are bartering chickens, goats or other food,"" Premdhoj Khadka of Lamjung district said.
However, an army spokesman, Colonel Dipak Gurung, said Thursday around 1,000 vehicles had ventured back onto the roads due to increased security along various routes.
It was impossible to verify the army's statement independently.
Despite the increased security, police reported Thursday the Maoists had torched four vehicles.
The Maoists also bombed the ancestral home of former finance minister Yadav Prasad Pant in Nawalparasi early Thursday. The motive was not immediately known and it was unknown if there were any casualties.
The rebels have been fighting to topple the monarchy and set up a communist republic since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed over 9,000 lives.
Gurung told the news conference that since a ceasefire with the rebels collapsed last August, 1,547 Maoists had been killed in clashes with security forces while 144 security personnel had died.

A statement issued after a meeting of representatives from the embassies of the United States, France, Germany, Britain, India and European Union said they condemn the attacks.
They condemned the rebel attacks on businesses as well as threats of violence, which have forced companies to close down operations.
""These Maoist actions violate the human rights of workers and cause great damage to the livelihood of thousands of innocent people, their families and the overall economy of Nepal,"" the statement said.
Last week, a Nepal unit of India's Hindustan Lever Ltd. was forced to shut down after rebel-affiliated All Nepal Trade Union Federation threatened to take action against the factory unless demands for higher wages and better working conditions were met.
Unilever Nepal - which produces soaps, toothpaste and cosmetics and is mostly owned by Hindustan Lever - said it was compelled to close its factory Wednesday for the safety of employees.
Suspected rebels also set ablaze a cotton yarn factory belonging to Junior Finance Minister Rup Jyoti last week.
""The forced closures and threats of closures of companies, including foreign joint ventures, continue to hurt the commercial interests of foreign investors in Nepal, deterring future investments in Nepal's economy,"" the statement said.
The representatives said that in the interest of the people of Nepal and to promote peace and prosperity, the rebels should cease their violent tactics, withdraw their threats of violence and allow businesses to operate freely.

  Talking to reporters after the signing of the blueprint of the interim constitution, CPN (UML) leader Bharat Mohan Adhikari said, ""The interim Constitution is another big leap in the political history of Nepal. With this, the country is about to enter into a new political direction."" 
  Maoist talks convener Krishna Bahadur Mahara described the interim Constitution as a major achievement of the historic people's movement. It has made the election to constituent assembly a certainty, Mahara added, claiming that the interim statute would be issued within the next 10 days. 
  Senior Nepali Congress leader Arjun Narsingh KC described the interim Constitution as being the outcome of a series of political agreements inked between the ruling Seven Party Alliance and the rebel Maoists on November 8 and 21. 
  ""The interim Constitution has effectively shifted all the privileges of the King to the Prime Minister. The King is totally powerless now,"" he said.

  Though it would not be easy to abolish the monarchy, the task [of abolishing monarchy would be complete through political consensus gradually, Pokhrel said, adding, ""Now the position of the monarchy is as good as suspended."" 
  The finalisation of the interim Constitution took place after four days of deliberations. Top leaders finalised and signed the draft at 7:30 a.m. today. 
  Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Maoist chairman Prachanda, UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress (Democratic) president Sher Bahadur Deuba, leaders of Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Janamorcha Nepal, United Left Front and other leaders of the eight parties were involved in negotiations to finalise the draft statute. 
  Remaining silent on the position of the King, the 168-Article interim Constitution will be issued by the House of Representatives after the management of Maoist arms. The right to education, healthcare and employment has been included in the state's directive principles but these rights will become fundamental rights after formulating separate law. 
  As per the draft, it will be a mixed electoral system for 425-seat Constituent Assembly for which 205 will be elected by direct voting and 204 will be elected through proportional system ensuring quota for women, indigenous nationalities and religious groups, while 16 members will be nominated by the Prime Minister with the consent of the cabinet.

"3980",20054022,"Title: Indian political delegation to Nepal greeted with stones, protests.rtf; Date: September 28, 2005 Wednesday 10:41 AM GMT; Text: Supporters of Nepal's king hurled stones at the vehicle of a seven-member delegation of Indian politicians as they arrived in the Himalayan kingdom Wednesday on a fact-finding mission, witnesses said.
The politicians, representing the ruling Congress party and the Communist Part of India (Marxist) among others, are part of the first high-level Indian delegation to visit Nepal since King Gyanendra seized power in February.
As they arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport, hundreds of protestors waved black flags, hurled stones at their vehicle and shouted slogans such as ""Stop Indian interference in our internal affairs"".
No one was injured in the protests.
The delegation from Nepal's powerful southern neighbor was invited to Kathmandu by an alliance of seven political parties that have been holding daily protests for most of September against Gyanendra's rule.
The king sacked the four-party coalition government for failing to tackle a Maoist rebellion that has claimed more than 12,000 lives since 1996.
Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and other members of the delegation have called on New Delhi to oppose the king's rule by banning arms sales and repeating calls for a return to democracy.
On September 3 the Maoists announced a unilateral three-month ceasefire, meeting a key demand of the country's seven-party alliance to hold talks with the rebels on forming a broad front against the king.

"3119",20043529,"Title: Bird Flu Not Going Away Soon, WHO Says.rtf; Date: February 16, 2004 Monday; Text: Bird flu is not going away anytime soon, the World Health Organization said Monday, as South Asian health officials agreed to cooperate in preventing the disease from spreading.
The officials adopted a resolution extending a temporary ban on all poultry and egg imports from countries affected by bird flu. The import of pet birds from all countries will also be temporarily banned.
""The outbreak is not going to be contained in one or two months,"" D.N. Kumara Rai, head of the WHO's communicable disease department in Southeast Asia, told The Associated Press.
Rai spoke on the sidelines of an emergency meeting of officials from the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to discuss ways to protect their region from the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus.
Ten countries - mostly in East Asia - are battling the disease in fowl, and have destroyed more than 60 million birds to contain the virus. Taiwan and Pakistan have reported a less-serious strain.
The virus has jumped to humans in Vietnam and Thailand, killing 20 people. Health experts say people infected with the disease contracted it from sick birds, but have repeatedly expressed concern the virus could link with the human flu virus and become transmittable through person-to-person contact.
Rai repeated those fears Monday.
""What we are afraid of is that if avian flu virus mixes with the human influenza virus, this will result in a new virus that is readily transmittable from human to human,"" Rai said. ""Once this occurs, we are really, really afraid of a global pandemic just like the Spanish flu that caused almost 40 million deaths"" in 1918.
Meanwhile, a joint resolution adopted by South Asian officials Monday extended a temporary ban on all poultry, egg and pet bird imports from countries affected by the bird flu.
The SAARC countries - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives - also will set up a center in New Delhi where samples can be tested. The resolution also called for stricter border surveillance.
""We are in the vicinity of another region which is reeling under this epidemic and it might affect us,"" Indian Health Secretary Prasad Rao said.
The meeting brought together health, agriculture and livestock officials from the seven countries, the first time they had met to face a possible health crisis. The political enmity between India and Pakistan has often thwarted SAARC health care programs.
According to Pakistani officials and poultry industry representatives, between 1.5 million and 3.5 million chickens around the southern city of Karachi were killed by the weaker H5N2 bird flu strain or slaughtered.
""Since Jan. 1, there has been no case. The situation is under control,"" said Dr. Baz Mohammed Junejo, the director-general of animal husbandry and livestock for the Sindh province of Pakistan.

Indian encroachment has resumed in Triveni Village in Susta, a border area in Nawalparasi District.
The encroachment is being done by Indian security forces in the name of constructing a road in the Nepalese village of Susta.
Farmers from Bihar [Indian state] have re-encroached about 26 bighas [about 40 hectares] of Nepalese land in the past 20 days for farming with backing from Indian security forces, says Save Susta Committee Chairman Gopal Gurung.
Officials from both countries had agreed two years ago to not encroach on the land in the area. But Biharis from India have seized the mustard and sugarcane harvests farmed in the region, according to Susta Village Development Committee Secretary Ghanashyam Gyawali.
Assistant Chief District Officer [of Nawalparasi] Bal Bahadur Malla said that he had already ordered the Armed Police Force to stop the encroachment.

 Adviser-member of the so-called Maoist Joint Revolutionary People's Council central popular government, Lok Bahadur Thapa, surrendered before the Kaski district administration office Wednesday 1 January , RSS Nepalese news agency reported.
 Thapa expressed the determination to get involved in the process of developing a peaceful society and abandon the Maoist party that preaches murder and violence.
 Stating that the reforms and changes wished by the Maoists party cannot be achieved through murder, violence, looting and destructive activities, Thapa declared that he would always struggle against violent policies and not be associated with any sister organization of the Maoists.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 2 Jan 03
Thapa had served as general-secretary of Nepal Magar Association, central vice-president of All Nepal Nationalities Association, founding chief of the Magarat Rastriya Mukti Morcha Nepal and also as general secretary of the former Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal.
 In a statement following his surrender, Thapa said that a solution of the present problem facing the country should be reached through the monarchical, multiparty system.
 Stating that before the Maoist party became involved in terrorist activities he had worked under the pseudonyms of Karnadwaj and Dharma, Thapa has also urged his daughter Amrita Thapa, son-in-law Hitman Shakya and all others involved in criminal activities to leave the path of murder and violence.
 Likewise, Tanahu District No 3 area member of the Maoist group Birendra Kumar Shrestha, also known as ""Chinkaji"", has surrendered before the district administration. He had been involved in terrorist activities for the past seven years. Stating that murder, violence and destructive activities would not bring revolution or change but only destroy the country, he has also urged the Maoist workers and guerrillas who have unknowingly been involved in terrorism and criminal acts to leave that outfit. All ground level workers of the Maoist party are forced to work with empty stomachs, all donations collected had to be handed over to the leadership and anyone leaving the party was threatened with dire consequences, Shrestha said, adding that if a conducive atmosphere was provided, not even one-third of the Maoists workers would continue in the movement.
 Similarly, Shanti Tamang, who had been declared a martyr by the Maoist group, also surrendered before the district administration Wednesday. Tamang had been injured after being fired at while trying to escape a security forces cordon. Stating that the army personnel donated their blood to save her life, Tamang has expressed surprise over rumours spread after declaring her a martyr. She has also urged the authorities concerned to make arrangements for a living for her such as a business or employment as she has nowhere to go following her surrender.

"5435",20066043,"Title: Nine Pakistanis involved in Mumbai train blasts - Indian official.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 29, 2006 Wednesday
Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
New Delhi, 29 November: Nine Pakistan-based jihadi terrorists were involved in the 11 July bomb attacks on Mumbai's commuter trains, National Security Adviser M K Narayanan said Wednesday [29 November].
""The investigation into this incident is complete, and the involvement of nine Pakistan-based jihadi terrorists, of whom one died, has been confirmed in the investigation,"" he told an international seminar here on ""Growing challenges of terrorism with special reference to railways"".
More than 20 Indians involved in carrying out the attacks were arrested and charge-sheeted, but the eight Pakistanis managed to escape to their country, he said.
Narayanan said the probe into the attacks had revealed that the Pakistanis came to India through three different routes - Bangladesh, Nepal and the sea - and were directly involved in planting the bombs.
The explosives were stored in a residential suburb in Mumbai and packed into pressure cookers before being placed in first-class train compartments. A great deal of ""advance planning and careful preparation"" had gone into the attacks that were masterminded ""by well-known jihadi leaders in Pakistan like Azam Cheema"", he said.
Intelligence experts have managed to piece together the information obtained from the train bombings and probes into other terrorist attacks to reach a ""conclusion about the existence of a common thread linking attacks on mass transport networks, such as the Mumbai blasts, with targeted attacks on religious places like Varanasi and the Ram Janmbhoomi Complex"" and the blast in Delhi's Sarojini Nagar market, he said. 
Referring to terror attacks on mass transportation systems in India, Narayanan said the Mumbai bombings were not a solitary instance of their kind, though it was the most serious terrorist strike to date.
He also pointed to cases of bombs being planted inside train compartments, including the blast in the Shramjeevi Express in July last year that killed nearly a dozen passengers.
In the past 18 months, he said, there have been at least half a dozen attempts at tampering with rail tracks for subversion.
Quite a few instances of firing on passengers at railway platforms have also occurred, resulting in the killing and injuring of innocent passengers, he said. But he admitted not all of these incidents were the handiwork of jihadi groups.
Narayanan said mass transportation systems have been attractive targets for terrorist groups the world over and India is not an exception. He was of the view that there are inherent difficulties in providing fool-proof security in any large mass transportation system.
""Inflicting vast numbers of casualties with consequential damage and disruption makes this tempting for terrorist groups,"" he said, recalling the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995, the attack on the suburban train network in Madrid in March 2004 and the London Underground blasts of July 2005.

 Kathmandu, 18 May: Five agitating political parties, whom the king criticized as a harbinger of ""corruption and bad governance"", have decided to chart a new strategy. Still they are waiting for a collective royal audience.
 The agitating parties, which have been waging a continuous disobedience movement for one and a half months, are to hold a meeting soon to discuss the next movement. Amik Sherchan of the People's Front Nepal said that the king's criticism of the political parties has come in a serious manner, and that they will hold a meeting to discuss it.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 May 04
Since it has been made public that the king does not favour democracy, the political parties will intensify the movement against monarchy, Nepali Congress leader former deputy prime minister Ram Chandra Poudel said.
 Singling out Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML as the consensus candidate of the five parties, Poudel said: ""The movement will not end until it assumes the power to bring the king to an open field. Now we are ready to confront the palace as well.""
 Addressing a mass gathering after a protest rally in the capital on Tuesday 18 May , Poudel added: ""The king's remarks have shown that he does not need democracy. If the king does not need democracy, we do not need monarchy as well."" Poudel accused the palace of being in search of another ""orderly"" instead of appointing the unanimous candidate proposed by the five political parties.  Note: Political parties have been referring to two prime ministers appointed by the king as ""orderlies""
 Poudel has spoken harshly against the palace after the morning meeting of the Nepali Congress on the king's remarks.  Note: When asked to hand over power to the five agitating parties during a luncheon hosted at Gokarna on 17 May, the king reportedly told the editor of an English magazine that he would do so overnight if the editor wants him to empower leaders who misgovern, and are corrupt.
 ""On moral grounds, we are ready to compare ourselves with the king in an open field,"" Poudel said. ""The king's remark is equivalent to pelting stones from inside a glass house.""
 Bharat Mohan Adhikary, member of the Standing Committee of the CPN-UML, recalled that 12 days have past since the king approved the prime minister's resignation, and still the nation is without a government. Adhikary told Rajdhani newspaper such a remark will only widen the differences between the king and the political parties, and it is detrimental to the king and the institution of monarchy.
 Adhikary expressed resentment at not appointing his party's general secretary, who has been given a clean chit by the Judicial Investigation Commission on Property. ""If the king takes our amicability as our weakness, then we can raise issues against the king. It is in the interest of monarchy to hand over state power to the political parties,"" he said.  passage omitted

"7463",20113368,"Title: Celebrating _Tagoreka Patraharu_.rtf; Date: May 12, 2011 Thursday; Text: KATHMANDU, May 12 -- The immense esteem Rabindranath Tagore holds amongst people, even after 150 years was evident at the four day festival organized to celebrate the birth of the poet, writer, song writer and a creative genius.
The finale of the festival had a play written and performed by the 'Sarwanam' theatre group. Ashesh Malla, the concept designer and director of the play took a creative step and presented a play which was an assortment of five literary creations of Tagore.
Taking characters from three stories and two poems written by Tagore, the director related five sections of the 75 minutes play through a narrator.
As the play began, the narrator looked immersed in a bulky book he carried along filled with creations of Tagore. As he spoke out to the audiences, the characters came to life giving an initiation to the play.
'The postmaster' a tragic tale of an orphan girl, left behind by a postman who decides to leave her and return home to his family, was the first to take on stage. 'Pujarini' a tragic poem about a girl who is ordered a death sentence by the king for worshipping Buddha was the second one.
Third depicted a dancing diva from the poem 'Abhishar.' The story talks of a beautiful young girl rejected and exiled from her town. She was condemned for being old in age and with a diseased body. A sage nevertheless comes to her and lends a helping hand.
The salvation of the lady was followed by the story of never ending greed of a Zamindaar. For 'Duibigha Jameen' the landlord plots and deceives a poor farmer snatching away his land.
Final show was that of young Chandra who takes on herself the blame for the murder of her sister in law. Based on the characters of the story 'Sajaya,' where the murder is actually committed by her brother in law, this tragic tale ends with Chandra being declared guilty by the court.
Although based on the works of an Indian writer, the treatment of the characters throughout the entire play had a Nepali flavor to it.
Husband wife quarrel over 'bhat pakaune' to names like Dhana Prasad which contributed towards adding a local touch.
Also worth a mention is the music, immersed thoughtfully into the play. Loud beating of the drums introduce a cruel king, and the contrast created by the name of a character 'Dhana Prasad' who owns only 'duibhigha zamen' could be seen as plus points of the play.
At times the narrator would interact with the characters giving the classic tales a post modern touch. The director explained his use of the narrator, saying ""bringing five different plots together was the most challenging part for me and therefore I have used the narrator.""
""My only endeavor was not to kill the writer's emotions,"" he stated. The Sarwanam group was approached two months prior to the play by Anandalok according to Malla.
Anandalok is a group of worldwide Rabindranath Tagore aficionados who along with the Embassy of India and B.P. Koirala India-Nepal foundation collaborated to bring about the festival.

""Impunity persisted for perpetrators of human rights abuses during the conflict. The authorities failed to implement court-ordered arrests of military personnel accused of offences involving human rights violations; police refused to file complaints or investigate such cases,"" the rights watchdog said in its global human rights report released on Friday.
Nepali government officials, the report added, ""actively obstructed accountability mechanisms"" and commitments made by political leaders in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).
The report referred to indifference of political parties in translating their commitments to human rights in the CPA into practice. They had agreed to address conflict-time human rights issues in the historic agreement but the political leaders have given little attention to implement their commitments and have primarily focused on integration and rehabilitation of Maoist combatants, it said.
Speaking at the report release program, AI Director Rameshwor Nepal said Maoists have threatened lawyers and human rights defenders who have been demanding action against Maoist leader Agni Sapkota, who is Minister for Information and Communications. Sapkota has been accused of being involved in the killing of one Arjun Lama in 2005.
""Ethnic, religious and gender discrimination went largely unchallenged. Violence against women and girls persisted,"" the report added.
The global human rights watchdog has also expressed concern over the protracted delay in passing laws on transitional justice mechanisms, saying there are ""notable"" shortcomings in the proposed draft bills of such laws.
The government had registered bills on Disappearance Commission and Truth and Reconciliation Commission in parliament in April 2010. But the bills are waiting to be endorsed as parties have shown no urgency for their enactment.
On human rights situation of Tarai where over 100 armed groups are reportedly active, AI has accused security agencies of using excessive force and of even killing people suspected of affiliation with armed groups in ""fake"" encounters. It further added that the armed groups are also involved in human rights violations.
The report added that Dalits, indigenous peoples, disabled people, religious and sexual minorities suffered social exclusion despite legal recognition of their equal rights.
""Legislative efforts to combat gender inequality did little to curtail discrimination against women in public and private life,"" the report said, ""Women, particularly Dalit women, faced obstacles in relation to access to justice, asset and property ownership, inheritance, income and employment conditions, and political representation.""
Speaking at the report release program, Robert Godden, Asia Pacific Campaign Coordinator, said political pressure on police, non-compliance with court orders, withdrawal of criminal cases have subverted justice system in Nepal.
He also expressed concern over Nepal's move of curtailing the rights of Tibetan refugees to peaceful assembly and expression in recent times.
""One-China policy does not override government's national and international obligation,"" Godden said, referring to Nepal government's foreign policy toward China and moves restricting rights of Tibetan refugees.

At the meeting held Friday evening, Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal proposed that the parties should now focus on constitution-writing and said the peace process can move forward only if there is a guarantee that constitution-writing will be completed in the next two months.
""The peace process cannot move forward as there is slim chance of promulgating the new constitution by May 28. Both the peace process and constitution-drafting can be taken forward simultaneously,"" a NC leader quoted Dahal as saying.
The Maoists urged fresh agreements among the parties to take the peace process and constitution-writing forward in tandem - something the NC rejected outright.
Talking to media after the three-hour meeting, NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel said the Maoists proposed inking a fresh agreement to take the ongoing peace process to a logical end and promulgating a new constitution. ""But we said that there is no need to ink fresh agreements. We have already reached several agreements right from the 12-point agreement. We did not want to enter into the agenda of forging fresh agreements as proposed by the Maoists,"" he said.
Paudel said they got the impression that the Maoists want to promulgate a new constitution without concluding the peace process. ""We made it clear that the peace process should be concluded before the promulgation of a new constitution as per agreements reached in the past,"" he further said. ""We also told them that their unwillingness to conclude the peace process is tantamount to pushing the country towards disaster.""
NC leaders present at the meeting alleged that the Maoists did not appear keen on settling the issue of management of their arms and army. ""We have decided to sit for another round of talks after holding meetings within our parties,"" Paudel further said. ""We have asked the Maoists to take a decision on the peace process, bearing our concerns in mind.""
Maoist Vice-chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha told media that since there were no formal talks with the NC since the formation of the Maoist-backed government the talks Friday helped to end that lack of dialogue between the two major parties in parliament. ""The meeting dwelled on issues related to the peace process including army integration and constitution-drafting,"" he said.
Shrestha said that they put forth their respective concerns and suspicions and discussed ways to address them. ""There is a need of consensus among the parties to take the ongoing peace process to a logical end and promulgate a new constitution,"" he further said.
An NC leader present at the meeting said the Maoists could have organized the meeting just to show the public that they have not ignored the NC in the aftermath of forming a left-coalition government. ""There was no substantive proposal on the part of the Maoists on concluding the peace process and promulgating a new constitution,"" he said.

Organising a press conference in Biratnagar today, the YAN chairman claimed Parshu, the prime accused in the attack who police say they are searching rigorously for, has not fled arrest but is active with the association's day-to-day work in Biratnagar itself.
Parshu is charged with ordering the attack on Dhakal, a scribe for Nagarik daily, for his reportage relating to the June 1 scuffle at the Morang district court ( to a bitter rivalry between Basnet's group and its breakaway faction led by Abhishek Giri, who has been serving time in jail for murder.
At the press meet, the YAN chairman said journalist Dhakal, who suffered serious injuries in the assault and is currently in hospital, and Rohit Koirala, one of the assailants who was arrested by the police the same night, were friends, and claimed Dhakal sustained injuries in a drunken brawl with Koirala.
""The fight ensued after Koirala asked Dhakal why he covered the news about him. A drunken brawl between two friends has tainted the image of the association. This has violated our human rights,"" Basnet maintained, adding that Parshu has no connection with the attack.
Parshu was even present in the all-party meeting called to resolve the issue, said the YAN chairman, adding that If anybody could corroborate the charge against him, the YAN itself would produce him before the police. Basnet further claimed it was his organisation which handed over Koirala to police and said they are willing to help police nab another accused Manoj Rai.
Meanwhile a standing committee meeting of the YAN appointed a three-member probe team led by treasurer Niru Pal and ordered it to report its findings within five days. The YAN, the wing of CPN UML has drawn widespread criticism for its alleged role in beating up the journalist, which is clearly an incidence of a brutal attack on press freedom.

Another man, Chhatra Bahadur Tamand, was killed in the same way in Khandbari town, Sankhuwasabha district northeast of Kathmandu, he added.
The rebels, the official said, had bombed the ancestral home of chief of army staff Pyar Jung Thapa at Mukundapur village in Nawal Parasi district, 416 kilometres (260 miles) southwest of Kathmandu on Saturday.
The tin-roofed two-storey house was extensively damaged in the attack, he said.

Text of unattributed report headlined ""Nepal Maoists warn against reopening of schools"" published by Nepalese newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 29 May 
Nepalgunj [town in mid-western Nepal]: Schools in Banke [district in mid-western Nepal], which were to reopen from Sunday [27 May], remained closed after teachers associated with the Maoists issued written warnings against re-opening them. 
The Maoists issued the warning after a decision to re-open schools from Sunday was taken by a gathering comprising various educational organizations, school management officials, guardians and representatives of political parties three days ago. The Maoist-affiliated Educational Republican Forum wrote to the teachers' union in Banke and to private schools, threatening them not to re-open schools until their [Educational Republican Forum's] demands were met. The forum said if the schools were opened, 'They themselves would be responsible for whatever results came from the anger [of the Maoists]"". 
The decision to re-open the schools came in accordance with suggestions of the ""Educational Problems Resolution Task Force"", set up by a gathering of managers of private schools in Banke-Bardia [two districts in mid-west Nepal] last week and in response to pressure from guardians. ""As the teachers' unions have been issued warnings, we cannot risk the danger of attacks on the schools"", the manager of one private school said. 
However, in Bardia [district in mid west Nepal], most government and private schools have been functioning since Sunday after a week and a half's closure. 
The chief district officer of Banke, Chudamani Paudel, said those who run private schools were determined to run their schools if security was provided. ""Until there is a solution from the top, it will be difficult to guarantee security for all the schools"", he said. Two hundred and fifty government and private schools in Banke have remained closed since the past week and a half. 
Meanwhile, Educational Republican Forum activists have locked up the premises of the Banke district education office. After staging a sit-in at the office, the activists said they would not allow the office to function until their demands were met.

The U.N. team and representatives from the government, Maoist rebels, police and army flew to the mountainous areas just northeast of the capital, Katmandu, on Sunday.
Maoist rebels signed an agreement with the government on Wednesday to join an interim government, lock up their weapons and place their fighters under United Nations supervision.
The survey trips that began on Saturday are the first step in implementing the agreement, said Tourism Minister Pradeep Gyawali, who was among those on the trip.
The team flew to Illam in an eastern mountainous area of Nepal on Saturday for the survey.
The agreement says thousands of rebel fighters and their weapons will be placed in seven camps scattered across the Himalayan nation, and kept under U.N. supervision.
Thousands of government troops and weapons also will be sequestered under watch by the U.N.
It is not known exactly how many fighters the rebels have. The government has around 90,000 soldiers.
The decade-old Maoist insurgency has killed more than 13,000 people.
The two sides reached a cease-fire and began peace talks in April, but negotiations stalled for months when the rebels refused to part with their weapons. The government insisted that they give up their arms before joining an interim government.

""Investigation is under way,"" said Kedar Rijal, Superintendent of Police at Metropolitan Police Range, Hanuman Dhoka, adding, if found guilty they will be booked under Black Marketing and Certain other Social Offences and Punishment Act.
Police are planning to arrest BL Sharma, co-owner of Anmol Sweets, and his partners, who, according to the Department of Commerce, are Niranjan Banchhal, Uddav Thapa and Sanjaya Giri. ""Sharma is ill, but we are mulling over taking him into police custody at the hospital,"" said Rijal. The other three are at large.
Kathmandu Chief District Officer Lakshmi Prasad Dhakal has directed the police to carry out a thorough investigation. ""I have ordered the police to file a case against them as per the advice from the government attorney,"" said Dhakal.
DFTQC had conducted laboratory tests on Kanhaiya ghee and found that the clarified butter produced by Kanhaiya was not edible with it having the Reichert-Meissl value zero. RM value is an indicator of non-fat compounds in edible fats, and is especially high in butter. ""The sample in question is not ghee churned out of cow or buffalo milk,"" said Jeevan Prabha Lama, Director General of DFTQC.
""RM number is nil in Kanhaiya brand ghee. It means the company has been making false claims,"" said Lama. RM number set for Nepali standard is minimum 28. According to her, Anmol Sweets also has been cheating consumers by using sub-standard ghee to prepare food.
A market monitoring team led by a senior official from the District Administration Office, Kathmandu, had found 10 tins (11kg per tin) of sub-standard ghee and 100 packets of inferior spices at Anmol Sweets production unit and showroom in Bhatbhateni last Tuesday.
Bottled water, edible oils, milk and ghee are major adulterated items in the market.

In a letter released Monday, Annan told the Iraq Governing Council he would make an interim appointment soon ""to ensure that all ongoing United Nations activities concerning Iraq are coordinated and implemented.""
He repeated that a permanent replacement for the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was among the 22 UN staff killed in a suicide bombing of the UN's Baghdad office in August, would be named in the ""not too distant future.""
Annan spokesman Fred Eckhard said he was unaware when the secretary general, who is wary of returning his international staff to the unstable security situation in Baghdad, would make his decision.
""Whether it's a matter of hours or days, I honestly don't know,"" Eckhard said.
The letter came in response to a request from current Governing Council chairman Jalal Talabani, who said he understood Annan's security worries but urged him to name someone soon.
""The Governing Council feels the active participation of the United Nations in the political process and the development of Iraq is essential to the success that we all seek,"" Talabani wrote in his November 10 request.
""We understand the security concerns of your excellencyâ¦ nevertheless the time is due for the appointment.""
Talabani said the nomination was needed ""so that we can move forward towards the establishment of an internationally recognised representative government in Iraq.""
Debate has been swirling at the United Nations over what role the world body will play in Iraq, where the United States is speeding up its plans for a handover of power in the face of deadly resistance attacks.
But Annan has also pulled all foreign UN staff out of Baghdad and said last week that he would ""probably"" set up a regional office in either Cyprus or Jordan to oversee the work in Iraq.
UN international staff remain in other parts of the country along with thousands of Iraqis who work for the world body and its various aid agencies.
Former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, charged by Annan with investigating security surrounding the August bombing of the UN offices, said crack troops were needed in Iraq to prevent such attacks.
He proposed Nepalese Gurkha soldiers or troops from the French foreign legion as a deterrent to further attacks.

New Delhi, 19 March: Government of India is proposing to construct a 608-km road passing through five states to develop infrastructure and trade links along the Indo-China border and raise new paramilitary units to strengthen Border Guarding Forces (BGFs). The road link will span through areas from Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim and Arunchal Pradesh, informed sources said on Sunday [19 March].
Expected to cost about 9bn rupees, the road will be guarded by Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) along with the army. ""With the trade mart at Sherathang for business through Nathula (in Sikkim) becoming operational, India-China border trade is expected to start this year,"" they said.
India's border with China is characterized by high-altitude terrains and thin habitation resulting in inadequate development of infrastructure in these regions. ""In addition to upgradation of road infrastructure by the Defence Ministry, the Home Ministry has prepared a proposal to construct a road link totalling 608 km along the India-China border,"" the sources said.

""Inter-ministerial consultations are under way for finalisation of this project,"" they said. India shares 3,488 km boundary with China and the border is not fully demarcated and the process of clarifying and confirming the line of actual control is in progress.
The sources said government has ""adopted the principle of one-border-one-force for better accountability, command, control and strengthening of BGFs by raising new units in BSF [Border Security Forces], SSB, [Sashastra Seema Bal, Armed Border Force] ITBP [Indian Tibet Border Police] and Assam Rifles. It has also decided to deploy floating Border Observation Posts (BOPs) in the Sir Creek areas along the Indo-Pak[istan] border and in Sunderbans areas of West Bengal alongside Bangladesh border to check infiltration and smuggling or arms and drugs.
Policing of Nepal and Bhutan borders have been upgraded by deployment of SSB as BGFs and allocated a special component of one crore [10m] rupees per border district under the modernization of state police force scheme. Marine police is also being set up as a specialized wing of state police forces and will be equipped with vessels, vehicles to patrol areas close to coastlines.

Crown Prince Dipendra, the 29-year-old heir to the Himalayan kingdom's throne, was blamed for the palace massacre on June 1, 2001.
After shooting his family, the prince, who was allegedly drunk and high on drugs, apparently turned the gun on himself.
Though a palace investigation did not specify a motive for the killings, palace officials have said Dipendra quarreled with his mother over his choice of a bride.
The massacre brought in new King Gyanendra, marking the start of three years of political turmoil that saw a succession of three prime ministers, an increasingly vicious war between the army and Maoist rebels, and almost daily street protests in the capital of this Hindu kingdom.
Nepal has been without a working government for more than three weeks now, and the political parties and the king have not been able to reach an agreement on a new prime minister.
Memorial services were held across the country. People placed flowers on memorials and prayed for the peace of the souls of the slain royals.
In the capital Katmandu, hundreds of people visited the statue of Birendra at a busy intersection despite a transport strike called by communist insurgents. They burned incense while Hindu priests sang holy songs.

""It is a tragedy for the people of Nepal that full-scale armed conflict may now resume,"" Louise Arbour said after three police died Thursday in the first clashes in the Himalayan kingdom since Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Pranchanda on Monday announced the end of a four-month ceasefire.
The commissioner said her office would monitor the conduct of both parties and would report to the UN human rights commission.
""But there need not and must not be the same gross violations of international humanitarian law and human right standards that have been perpetrated during previous phases of the conflict,"" Arbour said.
The Nepalese army said three soldiers were also injured Thursday when a bomb exploded near their vehicle in western Nepal.
A local government office in the country's southeast was the target of another blast, although no one was injured.
Dahal said the truce was suspended in response to continued military action by the army although he promised civilians would not be targeted.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in the mountainous country of 27.5 million, which includes eight of the world's 10 highest peaks, since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.

More than 300 journalists were detained while covering the recent political demonstrations in Katmandu, and the Federation of Nepalese Journalists has alleged that police beat some of them with batons.
All have been released, but the federation, an umbrella body of media rights groups, on Saturday demanded that the prime minister publicly apologize and that the home minister resign over the alleged mistreatment of journalists.
""Our protest is against the abuses by the government and suppression against the media,"" said Taranath Dahal, president of the federation.
The protesters wore black bands around their arms during the rally and chanted anti-government slogans. Police did not intervene in the demonstration, which was peaceful.
For the past few weeks the country's five largest political parties have been sponsored protests in Katmandu against King Gyanendra, calling for restoration of democracy in this Himalayan kingdom.
The king dissolved Parliament in October 2002 and fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control a Maoist insurgency. The king then assumed executive powers and replaced the government with pro-monarchy politicians.
Thousands of people have turned out for frequent rallies across the country since then, and police have detained hundreds of protesters. Most were released after questioning, but a handful are still in custody.
The government recently announced a ban on the protests, and threatened to arrest those who defy it.
The king announced last month that fresh elections would take place by April 2005. But the parties called the king's timetable for elections unrealistic. They want the king to immediately replace the current government with one that includes representatives from all five parties.

"3597",2005927,"Title: Japanese encephalitis death toll nears 1,000 in India and Nepal , doctors overwhelmed(3).rtf; Date: September 20, 2005, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: An encephalitis outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people - almost all of them children - in India and neighboring Nepal, as too few doctors struggle to care for thousands of sick children in outdated hospitals.
The death toll in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state stood Monday at 767, after 27 more deaths were reported overnight. Nepal on Tuesday raised its death toll from 204 to 271, pushing the regional toll past 1,000.
Every day, parents from the poorest corners of India's most populous state pour into the small town of Gorakhpur, some carrying unconscious children whose limp bodies flop from side to side as they're raced into one of the Japanese encephalitis wards at the B.R.D. Medical College.
But by the time many children arrive, there's little that can be done even to make them more comfortable. The tiny, often bare-chested children have oxygen masks taped to their faces - a grim scene stretching across two hospital floors.
For the handful of overworked doctors scurrying from patient to patient, it's an especially frustrating sight because the disease is easily preventable. Vaccines exist and measures can be taken to minimize exposure to the mosquitoes that spread the disease from pigs. But the tired physicians say such solutions might as well not exist without money and a strong political will to ensure that help reaches these poor, rural families.
Dr. O.P. Singh, director-general of health for Uttar Pradesh, has said it would cost about $58 million to vaccinate the more than 7 million children aged 15 and under in the most-affected areas. The state's entire health budget is $25 million.
""It's too hard for us also to see so many children and to see some dying and some handicapped and knowing this is a â¦ disease that can be controlled by removing all pigs from society,"" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, a pediatrician overseeing the encephalitis wards.
Japanese encephalitis, closely related to West Nile virus, is found only in Asia, where it's the leading cause of neurological infection. The World Health Organization says about 50,000 cases are reported annually, including 15,000 deaths, but many more go unreported.
Eastern Uttar Pradesh is especially prone to the disease because it is a prime rice-growing region that breeds mosquitoes. Its bowl-shaped geography allows little drainage after rains. Also, farmers often raise pigs close to where people live.
The disease sickens only about 1 in 250 people infected - with children from 1 to 15 the prime prey. Most adults in affected areas have developed immunity.
The illness causes sweltering fevers, convulsions and comas, and can leave permanent damage. The WHO estimates that up to 75 percent of survivors suffer lifetime disabilities, ranging from paralysis to mental retardation to sometimes-violent behavioral problems.
In the dilapidated hospital in Gorakhpur, about 40 miles from the border with Nepal, Kushwaha is one of only about a half dozen doctors caring for children suffering from the disease.
The bespectacled man with warm eyes and a kind, weary face, bounces between the various units - intensive care, general and recovering - checking machines and oxygen tanks while signing papers and answering a horde of worried parents' questions.
He has worked at the hospital since 1978 and seen bad outbreaks before, but nothing like this. The onslaught began in late July and is starting to show some signs of slowing, although Kushwaha estimates the actual number of infected children is four to five times higher than those seeking treatment at the hospital.
The overload has forced doctors to place two children to a bed, even in the intensive care unit.
For many children, the virus is just too strong. Golu, a tiny 2 1/2-year-old boy, looked as if he were sleeping peacefully as his grandfather wrapped a blanket around him and carried his body out of the hospital for burial.

 Kathmandu, 29 August: Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa today appealed to the agitating political parties to postpone their agitation considering the gravity of the situation developed after the Maoists breached the seven-month cease-fire.
 In his address to the nation, PM Thapa said the agitation would only benefit the extra-constitutional forces, not the pro-constitutional forces.
 Thapa urged all the pro-constitutional political parties, civic society and media to be united to safeguard the constitution and democracy.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 30 Aug 03
""Issues raised by the agitating political parties can be addressed through dialogue, understanding and cooperation,"" Thapa said. The parties have decided to launch a ""decisive"" protest programme against the 4 October royal move to sack the government of Sher Bahadur Deuba next week.
 Hinting at the possibility of resuming peace talks with the rebels, PM Thapa however said there would be a major shift in the government's policy towards them.
 ""The government will now confine its efforts to maintain law and order and hold general elections at the earliest,"" said Thapa.
 Thapa also termed the Maoists' Wednesday move to breach the cease-fire as ""unfortunate"" and said it has revived the series of murder, violence and attacks in the country.
 Thapa hinted that the government would beef up security in the country immediately to quell the rebel activities. ""There may be some difficulties to the people in such situation,"" Thapa said. ""But the present troublesome phase would come to an end soon.""
 Thapa underlined the government's commitment to foil all sorts of ""violent"" actions targeted at the popular sovereignty, multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy at all cost.
 ""The government has declared the Maoist group and its sister organizations terrorists and ordered the security forces to counter activities of the terrorists and safeguard these fundamental principles of the constitution,"" said Thapa.
 He said the Maoists compelled the government to take harsh decision after they escalated violence by attacking former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and high-ranking military officers.

Associated Press Writer
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) NATO forces are putting more trained Afghan troops on the front lines and plan ""rolling operations"" against Taliban insurgents who are intensifying their attacks but remain unable to mount territory-seizing offensives, military officers say.
But there's little prospect that the suffering of combatants or civilians will abate. After a bloody 2006, violence has escalated again, leaving more than 1,000 people dead in the first four months of 2007, according statistics compiled by The Associated Press.
In the field and at NATO headquarters, there's two-fold optimism for their military campaign in the months ahead: that large-scale operations against the Taliban's southern strongholds have blunted what appeared to be a drive to seize vital terrain, and that the Afghan National Army is crystalizing into an effective fighting force.
""We're cynical about the so-called spring offensive. It may happen but so far we haven't seen one,"" says British Squadron Leader David Marsh, NATO's spokesman in the south. ""We've had a winter campaign to knock off what they might be able to do in the spring.""
Yet, in a sign the conflict is deepening, the casualty figures on all sides for the first four months of the year are sharply up.
With the annual fighting season scarcely begun, at least 320 Afghan civilians and military and about 680 militants have been killed so far in 2007, according to figures compiled by AP from Afghan, NATO and U.S. officials.
That combined toll of 1,000 is more than double the total fatalities for the first four months of 2006 which saw the deadliest spate of fighting in Afghanistan since U.S. led forces ousted the Taliban regime in late 2001.
The number of militants killed has more than tripled in 2007, and combined casualties among civilians and Afghan security forces have also doubled. The number of coalition and NATO soldiers killed has risen to 39, from 15 during the same period of 2006.
Deadly bombings happen every day. Last week, a roadside bomb hit a U.N. convoy in the main southern city of Kandahar, killing four Nepalese guards in the deadliest attack for the world body in Afghanistan since the Taliban's ouster. On Wednesday, a bombing killed seven Afghan soldiers in eastern Paktika province, the latest in a string of attacks that have inflicted multiple casualties on security forces.
There have been at least 39 suicide attacks this year, a threefold increase over the same period in 2006, according to the NGO Safety Office, which advises relief groups on security.
Last year's ominous upsurge in Taliban strength prompted calls to increase U.S. and NATO troops, which are expected to total 52,000 by summer's end from the current 47,000, NATO spokesman Col. Tom Collins said. That compares with about 32,000 at the start of 2006.
Forces, he said, would be fighting a ""rolling series of operations,"" not necessarily just in prime Taliban strongholds like Kandahar and Helmand provinces but in other areas where the militants were concentrated but had not yet been confronted.
Last year, it became apparent that militants were able to control tracts of southern Afghanistan and wanted to expand their domain. NATO had to mount a major offensive that inflicted major losses on hundreds of Taliban fighters threatening the main southern city of Kandahar.
Seth G. Jones, of the U.S.-based think tank RAND Corporation who visited Kandahar early this year, says the Taliban is not capable of taking on NATO in pitched battles, but ""may only need to conduct a limited military offensive"" to extend their influence.
""Their short-term strategic aim, in my view, is to increasingly take territory in the east and south. If they can do this at the village and district level through a combination of fear and exploiting local grievances against the Afghan government, they may be able to take territory without significant amounts of (military force),"" he said in an interview.
Even a record number of Western forces will find it difficult to counter the militants' influence in Afghanistan, a country about 50 percent bigger than Iraq. And Afghanistan's history of aversion to foreign intervention also suggests that a prolonged military presence could backfire like the Soviet occupation of the 1980s.
""Only the Afghan government can win this battle, which is primarily political. If we fight a colonial war, we lose,"" says Barnett R. Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University, who like many stress that building up an effective Afghan army will be one ingredient for success.
While criticizing the police force for corruption and government for weaknesses, NATO troops who fight alongside Afghan soldiers invariably heap praise on them. Significantly, so do many fellow countrymen.
""The police are thieves and drug mafia, but the soldiers treat us with respect and try to provide security,"" says Alaji Ak"

Meanwhile, the eastern regional bureau of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) today claimed that the army killed their cadre in cold blood in Ramechhap District. Altogether 19 Maoists were killed in the incident, which the army claims to be an encounter after the rebels ""ambushed"" them.
 In a statement signed by in-charge ""Kanchan"" received here, the rebels said that the army attacked the Maoists all of sudden when they had peacefully gathered at Doramba-2 for a discussion. While one of the rebels was killed on the spot, other 18 were taken to Dandakateri, one hour walk from Doramba, and shot in cold blood. ""We strongly condemn this barbaric and cowardly murder,"" said ""Kanchan"", adding it was part of the controversy to sabotage the peace talks.

The police had been searching for him for over two decades now, since 1986.
  Brijesh Singh, a one-time associate of Dawood Ibrahim, is the most feared name in Uttar Pradesh, although his operations in getting railway tenders and in liquor, coal and scrap businesses are spread across the country. He was arrested by a team of the Delhi Police's Special Cell from a popular shopping complex in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday evening. The Special Cell team under the supervision of Joint Commissioner Karnal Singh and DCP Alok Kumar had been on his trail for the past three years.
  Police said the gangster, with strong political connections, had been using a fake identity in Bhubaneswar and was believed to have been trying to get a plastic surgery done to change his looks.
  ""During the second week of January this year, we received information that Singh was shuttling between Kolkata and Bhubaneswar in order to settle his business deals. This information was further developed and we zeroed him down in Bhubaneswar,"" said Joint Commissioner Karnal Singh.
  ""On Wednesday, he was tracked down at a shopping complex in Bhubaneswar. He was overpowered and arrested."" The 39-year-old, who had an Interpol Red Corner Notice against him, entered the world of crime in 1984 to avenge the killing of his father.
  In 2001, after a shootout with a rival gang in Uttar Pradesh, he was presumed dead. However, he had actually sneaked out of the country to Nepal from where he went around hiding in some southeast Asian countries. It was not immediately known when he returned to India.
  The search for him was difficult as police had only one photograph of him - that too with the UP police. Also, the photo was that of a 17-year-old, don-in-the-making.

 Muktiram Dahal's son Puspakamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, is the chairman of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), which has been waging an armed insurgency in the Himalayan kingdom to abolish monarchy and set up a republican state.
'No Nepalese would make a revolution success by killing another Nepalese. I would urge him (Prachanda) to follow the path of peace,' the senior Dahal, 76, told human rights activists and journalists at his home in Bharatpur on Monday.
 He said chances are slim that he would meet the son he last saw 10 years ago, one year before Prachanda's party launched the insurgency.
 Muktiram said he has always been keen to play a role in restoring peace in Nepal, and is more than happy to join the human rights group's peace campaign starting in April this year.
 The father of two sons and six daughters, Muktiram lives in his ancestral home in Bharatpur. His younger son is studying in Britain.
 Nepal's ongoing antimonarchist conflict has claimed more than 11,000 lives in the past nine years.

Namuna -- whose nom-de-guerre means ""exemplary"" -- is one of around 19,000 former guerrillas preparing to spend their third winter in UN-monitored camps as part of a peace deal that ended Nepal's decade-long civil war.
""Integration into the army should take place as soon as possible,"" the 26-year-old nurse and former fighter told AFP as she took a break from her work at the Maoist Shaktikhor camp hospital, a four-hour drive south of Kathmandu.
The former rebels, who now run the impoverished country after winning polls in April, insist they should be part of a new national army but Nepal's main opposition party is determined to keep them out.
On a visit last week, the camp of 1,200 Maoists was a hive of activity as the young men and women received communist ideological training, lessons on how to handle weapons as well as drilling with replica wooden rifles.
""Without our integration, there can be no peace,"" said the Maoist, whose real name is Biraja Adhikari and who treated battlefield bullet wounds and performed amputations during the civil war that claimed 13,000 lives.
The Maoists in the camp keep fit with highly competitive games of football and volleyball on well-kept playing grounds, and have a far higher standard of living than nearby villagers.
The issue has turned into a political hot potato.
A government committee has been formed to decide the future of the former fighters but the Nepali Congress party, the second largest after the Maoists, has refused to join and insists the ex-guerillas cannot be part of the army.
""They will have to give up their political involvement and association with the party they are with now. We don't want an indoctrinated army,"" said senior Congress leader Ram Sharan Mahat.
His party's support was essential for the Maoists to join the national army, the former finance minister said, citing constitutional provisions.
Mahat's Congress party holds 120 seats in the 601-member assembly elected in April.
The Nepal Army -- formerly a bastion of support for monarchy that was abolished by the Maoist-dominated assembly in May -- said it was awaiting the outcome of political deliberations to decide the future of the rebels.
""Let the government and the parties make their decision,"" army spokesman Brigadier General Ramindra Chhetri told AFP.
""I can't say if the Maoists will meet recruitment criteria,"" the army spokesman said.
But in Shaktikhor camp, set amid cleared jungle, the former guerillas said they were certain they would join the new national army -- sooner or later.
""There can't be two armies as there are now,"" said company commander Keshab Adhikari, 27, as he relaxed after a communal lunch of lentil curry and rice.
""We've agreed to form a new national army and that means the Nepal Army should change and our People's Liberation Army should also change,"" said Adhikari.
Since the peace deal two years ago, the Maoists have been trying to transform themselves from a guerilla force into a mainstream army, added Pralok, whose given name was Prakash Chandra Panday. 
""During the war we were answerable only to the party. Now we have to follow standards laid down by the government,"" said Pralok, whose nom-de-guerre means ""celestial"".
""We're training really hard to become part of the new national army,"" said the Maoist.

Excerpt from news report published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 20 November
Rolpa [district in mid-western Nepal], 19 November: Investigations into abuses of human rights here during the Maoist people's war have started. 
The National Human Rights Commission and Insec [Informal Sector Service Center] have started investigations into the violations of human rights by both the government and the Maoists. Insec district representative Ghanashyam Acharya said investigations have started on the basis of complaints filed by the families of the victims. In the course of this the killing of 48 members of the general public by the security forces on the accusation of being Maoists, that took place at Gumchal village 11 years ago, will also be investigated. [Passage omitted: details about the Gumchal incident] At the time human rights workers could not go to the village because of lack of security, Acharya said. Following the incident some people became displaced from the villages as the Maoists started to seek out informers.
According to Insec representative Acharya, widespread abuse of human rights took place in the village by the government and the Maoists both. Innocent people lost their lives as the two sides did not adhere to the rules of war. The condition of 36 people who disappeared at the time is still not known.

 Jungathapachaur (Jajarkot) mid-west Nepal , 21 January: Rebel CPN (Maoist) have declared eight districts of mid-west Nepal Bheri-Karnali an autonomous region. They declared the region ""under a strategy to capture power at the centre.""
 Addressing a meeting at the remote village of Jungathapachaur in Jajarkot Monday 19 Jan , politburo member Krishna Bahadur Mahara said: ""We have reached a stage to capture power at the centre."" He was addressing a mass meeting announcing the launch of the provincial government.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Jan 04
Mahara added: ""We will unify all our forces and concentrate our efforts to capture power at the centre. He said the ""old state"" that is about to collapse and the party will concentrate its entire attention to topple it; he claimed an atmosphere has been created for it.
 He said a provincial government was formed to establish a ""new state power"" in an organized manner; Mahara said the formation of the Bheri-Karnali Autonomous Region a milestone.
 Mahara said nine to 10 provincial governments will be formed ahead of capturing power at the centre. Magarat Autonomous People's Government was announced 9 January.
 Party Spokesman Mahara dismissed Royal Nepal Army claims Maoist military strength had diminished and military strategy had been changed to capture power at the centre. ""We have not weakened. Only our strategy has changed,"" he said."" We will demonstrate our strength by creating a storm."" He said the revolution had reached a counterattack phase.
 He said political and military strategies were being pursued simultaneously to capture power. ""Unity of the people is limited to rights. Rights given to them is determined by national unity,"" he said.
 He argued national unity can be assured only by empowering all regions, classes and backward nationalities.
 Spokesman Mahara said the war against ""the old state"" limited to 20 per cent of the country will continue. ""The war will continue. We are ready to make any sacrifices,"" he said. He said soldiers and policemen were defecting in hordes.
 He praised the seven student unions fighting regression and criticized political parties making contradictory statements.
 Representatives of village and district people's government meeting at Birendra Aishwarya Secondary School for three days appointed a 21-member Bheri-Karnali Autonomous People's Government. Three hundred representatives from Jajarkot, Dailekh, Surkhet, Dolpa, Jumla, Humla, Mugu and Kalikot participated.
 Newly elected chief of the autonomous region Khadka Bahadur Bishwakarma said he will give new life to the region. He has been given all powers, except foreign, defence and communications. Freedom of speech and press has been enshrined as a basic policy of the provincial government.
 Similarly, secularism, national socialism, end of discrimination and exploitation are the policies of the provincial government.
 One million people live in eight districts of the region.
 The meeting continued until 9.30 at night despite efforts by the Royal Nepalese Army to disperse the meeting Monday afternoon 19 January in aerial attacks, the meeting was held under strict security of the people's militia. Five thousand people were present at the meeting; another 2,000 fled after the aerial attack.

 Chief rebel leader Prachanda said the general strike is called for Feb. 5-11,, while other nationwide protest programs will include 'physically attacking' of candidates seeking to contest the Feb. 8 elections.
The royal government plans to hold the elections in 55 municipalities across the kingdom in a bid to 'reenergize' democracy in the country, which has been left to a limbo following King Gyanendra power seizure in February this year.
 The country's major political parties also reject the planned elections, saying King Gyanendra should first hand over power to popular representatives.
 The Maoist insurgents torpedoed a general election that was planned for November 2002 with the result that Nepal today has no elected parliament, nor any elected local bodies. King Gyanendra rules through an unelected council of deputies and ministers.
 The rebels first want an election of an assembly to draw up a new constitution that would confine the king's role to that of a mere titular head.
 In his statement Thursday, Prachanda called on the Nepalese people to help 'prepare the basis for polls to the constituent assembly.'
 The rebel leader, who chairs the underground Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), also appealed to the international community for support for a recent pact reached between his party with seven Nepalese mainstream political parties to end the country's decade-long communist rebellion.
 Under the pact reached in New Delhi, the rebels agreed to lay down their arms if a new constitution is drawn up curbing the powers of the king. But the royal government has flatly rejected the pact.

Buses carrying passengers to other parts of the Himalayan kingdom and trucks hauling fresh produce began leaving the city unaccompanied by the military escorts that had guarded them during the seven-day blockade.
The shutdown had been enforced through threats and prices had shot up as truckers demanded more money to defy the Maoist rebels, who control much of rural Nepal and are fighting to overthrow the monarchy.
Min Bahadur Tamang had been waiting for the blockade to end so he could take his 14-year-old daughter to Kathmandu for treatment of typhoid.
He rushed his daughter into a taxi as soon as he arrived early Wednesday at the Gongbu Bus Terminal in the capital.
""I was stranded in my village in Dhading,"" some 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the west, said Tamang, 46.
""I'm very relieved now. I had been worrying for the past several days as my daughter could not get the proper treatment,"" he said.
The Gongbu terminal returned to its busy look Wednesday with at least 69 buses going out of the station in the morning, compared with 23 buses a day from all of Kathmandu during the blockade, said Arun Thakuri, a terminal manager.
""Our buses would go out of Kathmandu taking a big risk of being attacked by the strikers"" during the blockade, Thakuri said.
Usually, 600 buses enter or leave Kathmandu each day, 250 of them from the Gongbu terminal, he said.
Relief was also felt on the fruit and vegetable markets, which remained well-stocked throughout the blockade but saw costs surge.
Vendors said prices were beginning to go down marginally, although it would take a few days for a full return to normal as supply routes were restored.
""We can now heave a sigh of relief,"" said vegetable and fruit dealer Rajan Bharati, 35, as his assistants sold bags of tomatoes, radishes, cucumbers and onions.
He said merchants had to pay up to 10 times as much to truckers who defied the blockade to bring fresh produce into Kathmandu -- prices that were passed on to customers.
""We will make up for the losses,"" he said. ""However, it is the common people who have to suffer as they have to buy things at a high price.""
Most of his produce was shipped in from outside Kathmandu, either other parts of the kingdom or India.
He said a vendor can make around 1,200 rupees (16 dollars) on a good business day, but he had to pay rent of 3,700 rupees (50 dollars) a month for his space at the market.
The Maoists have warned they are only suspending the blockade for a month unless the government concedes to their demands.
The rebels want immediate talks on their terms to end the war which has claimed some 10,000 lives since 1996.
The blockade was seen as symbolic pressure on the government and the people of Kathmandu, where there is little overt support for the mostly rural rebels.

"5333",20066265,"Title: Nuclear Deal With India a Victory for Bush.rtf; Date: March 2, 2006 Thursday 5:29 PM GMT; Text: On his first trip to India, President Bush and his Indian counterpart agreed Thursday on a landmark nuclear energy agreement that deepens ties between the world's oldest and largest democracies.
Bush acknowledged it will be difficult to persuade Congress to support the agreement, in which the United States would share its nuclear know-how and fuel with India. But he said he's confident it will be approved so India can power its fast-growing economy without expanding world demand for oil.
Critics in Congress say the United States is making an exception for India, which has nuclear weapons but won't sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
""Proliferation is certainly a concern and a part of our discussions, and we've got a good-faith gesture by the Indian government that I'll be able to take to the Congress,"" Bush said.
""But the other thing that our Congress has got to understand is that it's in our economic interests that India have a civilian nuclear power industry to help take the pressure off the global demand for energy,"" the president said. ""To the extent that we can reduce demand for fossil fuels, it will help the American consumer.""
The agreement was a political coup, too, for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""We made history,"" he said, standing alongside Bush in a sunwashed courtyard.
Bush mourned the loss of life in a suicide bombing Thursday in Karachi, Pakistan, that ripped through the parking lot of the Marriott Hotel and broke windows in the nearby U.S. consulate. At least four people died, including a U.S. foreign service officer. The attack occurred hundreds of miles from Islamabad, where Bush was headed later this week.
""Terrorists and killers are not going to prevent me from going to Pakistan,"" Bush said.
For a second day, thousands of demonstrators gathered in New Delhi to protest Bush's visit. Dozens of politicians, mainly from leftist parties, stood on the steps of the country's national parliament building chanting ""Bush go back!"" and ""Down with Bush!""
""We're saying this because he is the biggest killer of humanity in the 21st century. He has killed in Afghanistan, he has killed Iraqis and now he is bent on killing Iranians,"" said Hannan Mollah, a lawmaker from the Communist Party of India (Marxist). ""The Indian government should not get into any deal with the Americans. Bush has laid a trap for India.""
In private meetings, Bush and Singh discussed various regional and international subjects, including the U.S.-India relationship, terrorism, Pakistan and Nepal, said Stephen Hadley, Bush's national security adviser.
They announced new bilateral cooperation on an array of issues from investment to trade, health to the environment, agriculture to technology, and even mangoes. Bush agreed to resume imports of the juicy, large-pitted fruit after a ban of nearly two decades.
""Mr. Prime Minister, the United States is looking forward to eating Indian mangoes,"" he said.
But the civilian nuclear agreement is the major building block of renewed relations between the United States and India, which is seeking greater recognition on the world stage.
Critics say the United States is using India as a counterweight to China's growing economic and political influence, and argue that the agreement sends the wrong signal to North Korea and Iran, which have rejected calls for international monitoring of their weapons programs.
Bush disagreed. ""What this agreement says is things change, times change that leadership can make a difference,"" he said.
""I'm trying to think differently, and not stay stuck in the past.""
In Washington, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said the agreement was a ""historic nuclear failure"" that will put U.S. national security at risk.
""With one simple move the president has blown a hole in the nuclear rules that the entire world has been playing by,"" said Markey, co-chairman of the Bipartisan Task Force on Nonproliferation and the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
The agreement marks a major shift in policy for the United States, which imposed temporary sanctions on India in 1998 after it conducted nuclear weapons tests. India insists it has been a good steward of nuclear material for decades; that there has never been one incident of proliferation from it.
Singh's leftist allies criticized the pact, saying it paves the way for U.S. meddling in Indian affairs. ""Today is one of the most shameful days in the history of independent India,"" said Shambhu Shrivastava, spokesman for the socialist Samata Party.
Bush and Singh signed an agreement in July, but it hinged partly on determining how to segregate India's nuclear weapons work from its civilian nuclear program. A senior administration official said India classified 14 of its 22 reactors as civilian, which would open them to international inspection; eight were deemed military reactors, making them exempt from inspection.

 Excerpt from editorial published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 31 January
 Bhutanese King Jigme Singye Wangchuk has said that majority of the refugees living in the Nepalese camps were not Bhutanese. The highly objectionable and controversial remarks of the king has only helped to obstruct the process of refugee repatriation. King Jigme, who was the chief guest at India's Republic Day function, told the journalists before returning home that most of the refugees were not Bhutanese. Instead, he said, they were the people living in India and Nepal. His faultfinding statement is nothing but his bravado.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 31 Jan 05
Jigme, who forcibly evicted more than 100,000 of his citizens a decade ago, is now evidently trying to fish in murky waters. In addition, he has overlooked his responsibility towards his people and tried to undermine the relations with Nepal. The refugees languishing in Jhapa and Morang districts in eastern Nepal are not only socially and economically suffering but also have been suffering from the discriminatory treatment from their home country. They are mentally traumatized for not being able to return home. Nepal is giving them shelter on humanitarian ground but the problem has become a cause for a headache.
 Anyone who fights for democracy and human rights and believes in the rule of law is suppressed in Bhutan. They are forced out of the country. The officials of the Jigme government have distributed the land of the refugees to their relatives and supporters to bar the refugees from returning. This is the crux of the problem.
 Jigme's remarks have made the refugees sad. It has prompted Nepal to rethink its ties with Bhutan. Nepalese minister and the human rights workers, leaders and minority communities in Bhutan have objected the Bhutan king's remarks. The king should correct what he said and repatriate his citizens in a dignified manner.  Passage omitted

 Three other rebels were arrested, while the others managed to flee, they said, adding that four pistols and two sets of bombs were recovered from the rebels.
 Maoist rebels have frequently looted banks and financial institutions since launching their armed insurgency in the country nearly eight years ago. It is widely believed they use the looted money for procurement of weapons.
 The rebels also solicit 'donations' from business houses and village people to fund the insurgency, in what the government calls extortion.

The crackdown comes after nearly two weeks of rioting in Nepal's impoverished southern Terai region by members of the Mahadhesi community, who have long complained of being discriminated against.
The two detained were former home minister Kamal Thapa and former minister of agriculture Badri Prasad Mandal.
""The former ministers were arrested for investigations into their alleged role in inciting violence in the Terai region,"" home ministry spokesman Baman Prasad Neupane told AFP.
""Other royally appointed ministers and officials as well as other individuals have been put under tight surveillance,"" added Kathmandu's chief district officer, Thaneshwor Devkota.
At least nine protesters have been killed and dozens injured in the Terai unrest.
The latest death came in the town of Biratnagar, 548 kilometers (342 miles) east of Kathmandu, a district official said Tuesday.
Bhola Prasad Siwakoti, the chief district officer from the town of Kalaiya -- one of three towns under curfew -- said the town was ""calmer"", with ""the streets deserted and all shops closed.""
Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was scheduled to address the nation late Tuesday, but cancelled the slated appearance.
""The prime minister will not address the nation today as the leaders from eight parties (seven parties in government and the Maoists) were not able to reach a consensus on how to tackle the issues raised by the Mahadhesi community in the Terai region,"" government spokesman and minister Dilendra Prasad Badu told AFP. 
""The leaders are still engaged in hectic discussions and are trying to find a solution on how to increase the electoral constituencies based on population,"" he said.
The Terai area, known as Nepal's ""bread basket"", is a low-lying region bordering India and is dominated by the Mahadhesi community.
Mahadhesi leaders say their group accounts for a third of impoverished Nepal's 27 million people yet is under-represented in Kathmandu's corridors of power -- even after the recent sidelining of the king.
Nepal's king was forced to end his absolute control over the country in April last year, after massive protests organised by sidelined political parties and the Maoists.
The king has since been stripped of most of his powers, but is still revered by many as a Hindu deity.
Late last year, the Maoists and government signed a peace deal that put an end to a decade of civil war. As part of the peace deal, the country will get a new constitution that could abolish the 238-year-old Shah dynasty.
While the government and former rebel Maoists have blamed pro-royalists for stirring up the unrest to undermine the peace deal, United Nations officials and analysts pointed to the marginalised Mahadhesi community's genuine complaints.
""What is happening in the Terai is in a sense inevitable,"" the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, said in Kathmandu last week.
""As the space for democracy opens up the possibility of airing grievances increases and when marginalised people are told there is a space opening up for them, they take it seriously,"" she said.
On Monday, a minister in the seven-party alliance government also resigned after accusing the administration of failing to address the Terai region's problems.
The leader of the Mahadhesi Janadhikar Forum, the main group involved in the the protests, told the Kathmandu Post newspaper that the unrest was simply ""an outburst (against) centuries-old suppression and deep-seated discrimination.""
""Mahadhesi concerns are being neglected. Why should there not be a revolution?"" Upendra Yadhav told the English language daily.
The group wants to see the region made into a federal state within Nepal and wants more representation in government.

"342",20032510,"Title: Nepali Leader Resigns Amid Protests.rtf; Date: May 30, 2003 Friday; Text: Nepal's prime minister resigned Friday following months of protests that his appointment was unconstitutional that have plunged the Himalayan kingdom deeper into a political crisis.
King Gyanendra accepted Lokendra Bahadur Chand's resignation and began consulting with members of the nation's five largest political parties to form a new Cabinet.
""My resignation, I hope, will pave way to resolve the present conflict,"" Chand said.
Political leaders planned to meet over the weekend to continue talks on forming a new government.
The king appointed Chand after firing an elected government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba on Oct. 11 for seeking to delay parliamentary elections scheduled for November because of threats from Maoist rebels.
""We told the king the only way out of this political crisis is by forming a new government and reinstating Parliament,"" Narayanman Bijuchche of the Nepal Workers and Peasant's Party said after the meeting.
Bijuchche hinted that Chand's successor could be Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, the second largest political party.
The main opposition parties called Chand's appointment unconstitutional and began a series of protests this month. Although the king has the authority to dismiss the elected government, critics say he went too far in firing Deuba.
On Wednesday, about 5,000 people protested in Katmandu and marched toward the parliament building.
They were blocked by police who used batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least two dozen were injured, including former parliament members and important political leaders.
Gyanendra ascended the throne in 2001 after his brother, Birendra, and eight other members of the royal family were gunned down by the crown prince, who then took his own life.
Deuba was fired after he moved to postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for November 2002, citing security concerns about the communist rebels. More than 7,000 people have been killed since their insurgency started in 1996.

"180",20031271,"Title: Maoist group calls off Nepal school strike after ceasefire.rtf; Date: February 6, 2003 Thursday; Text: A pro-Maoist student group Thursday called off a strike that was expected to cripple Nepal's schools next week, after the leftist guerrillas entered a ceasefire with the government.
The student group said its demands, mostly a reduction of tuition and other fees at the kingdom's private schools, could be settled through dialogue.
""We have decided to call off our proposed strike believing our demands would be met through discussions with the authorities,"" Devendra Parajuli, president of the All Nepal National Free Students Union-Revolutionary, said in a statement.
The strike had been slated to run indefinitely starting February 13, the seventh anniversary of the launch of the Maoists""People's War' to overthrow the monarchy.
The government and the rebels on January 29 announced a truce in the insurgency that has claimed more than 7,800 lives and are expected to begin peace talks shortly.
""The nation's main problem is resolving the current political crisis, so let us all focus on this issue,"" Parajuli said.
The Maoist students held a two-week strike in December around the Kathmandu Valley, keeping 500,000 students out of the classroom and torching several school buses.
They ended the shutdown after the government agreed to lower school fees and provide more financial support to low-income students.
Next week's strike would have affected some 1.6 million primary and secondary school students across Nepal.
The students had called the strike to demand another round of fee reductions and the lifting of a government labelling of the group as terrorist.
A government spokesman told AFP that meeting the earlier demands had cost the impoverished country's budget between 19.2 and 25.6 million dollars (1.5 billion to two billion rupees).
Private school administrators welcomed the withdrawal of the strike call.
Bhoj Bahadur Shah, general secretary of the Private and Boarding Schools Organization of Nepal, said that while some of the Maoist union's demands had merit, ""educational institutions should not be used for political means by the students.""

"6289",20072895,"Title: Nepal king makes rare public appearance.rtf; Date: February 16, 2007 Friday 2:40 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's embattled king made a brief public appearance Friday in Kathmandu amid tight security to observe a popular Hindu festival.
King Gyanendra was whisked into a centuries-old temple for the festival of Shivaratri, in only his second outing since the anti-royalist Maoists were admitted to parliament last month.
Government ministers who traditionally attend the festival with the king were absent this year.
The king, who has been stripped of most of his powers including control of the army since handing back direct rule last year, faces an uncertain future.
Former rebel Maoists and political parties have signed a landmark deal that means holding elections to a body to map Nepal's political future and decide the fate of the monarchy which Maoists want abolished.
The elections will be held by June. 
Crowds of people lined the streets approaching Pashupatinath Temple on Friday and cheered for the king while some groups shouted anti-king slogans as he entered the temple complex, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
Inside the compound, the king showered the cheering crowds with gold coins for a few seconds.
A handful of people also threw stones on his motorcade while he was preparing to leave after spending nearly two hours inside the temple, an AFP photographer at the scene said.
Police immediately dispersed the crowd but no arrests were made.
Devout Hindus venerate Gyanendra as a living incarnation of Vishnu, the Hindu god of protection, but his position in the Himalayan nation remains in the balance.
The Maoists have said they want to scrap the 238-year-old Shah dynasty altogether, but some in the seven-party government wish to see him retain a ceremonial role. Under the deal, the Maoists have been given seats in a new parliament with the parties.
Earlier in the day, thousands of security personnel mingled with tens of thousands of Hindu worshippers who thronged the temple to worship the Hindu God Shiva.
""At least 200,000 people have already visited the temple,"" said Nirmal Kuikel, the secretary of the Pashupati Area Development Trust.
More than 3,000 security personnel were mobilized, after government officials warned earlier this week that Hindu fundamentalists could use the annual festival to stage protests calling for Nepal to be renamed a Hindu state. 
Nepal was declared a secular state after King Gyanendra was forced to hand back direct rule.
Pashputinath Temple is Hinduism's holiest site in Nepal, and the festival is expected to attract around 300,000 people.
In a further sign of Gyanendra's diminishing role, the monarch was replaced by the chief of army staff at Army Day celebrations on Friday.

Police fired rubber bullets to ensure demonstrators remained beyond Kathmandu's ring road and away from King Gyanendra's palace as he struggles to quell almost three weeks of protests.
Thousands of Nepalis turned out on the 18th day of a general strike demanding the end of Gyanendra's absolute rule with many calling for an end to the monarchy. Political leaders also called for a major demonstration on Tuesday aimed at the heart of the city.
""The democratic republic has reached up to the king's ring road and now it moves to the royal palace,"" said senior protest leader Bamdev Gautam.
On Saturday, some 300,000 people marched to within one kilometre (about half a mile) of the king's palace before being beaten back by police.
""The curfew has been strictly enforced today and we're not going to take any chances,"" said a senior police officer on condition of anonymity. 
Clashes were reported in four areas of the city with hospital sources reporting 27 injured, including five seriously.
""Two protesters hit by rubber bullets were just brought in,"" said Dr. Santosh Giri, in the emergency department of Kathmandu's B&B Hospital. ""One of them is in a serious condition as he has been hit in the neck.""
At least 14 people have died and hundreds have been injured in clashes between pro-democracy activists and security forces in Nepal in an upsurge of civil unrest that began April 6 in loose alliance with Maoist rebels who want to overthrow the monarchy.
The opposition parties rejected an offer by the king Friday to return power to political parties sidelined in February 2005 as too little, too late.
""There is no way we can join the government and our general strike and peaceful protest will continue,"" the parties said in a statement on Saturday.
The continuing protests are seen as a direct snub to the king's offer to allow the alliance to select a prime minister, which came following two weeks of daily strikes and protests calling for an end to his absolute rule.
The king failed to meet a demand for the restoration of parliament dissolved almost four years ago. The opposition also want changes to the constitution to curb his power and remove his control over the armed forces.
Still, the offer by Gyanendra earned a qualified welcome from the international community  and the king apparently is reluctant to cede any more power setting the stage for more confrontation.
An editorial in the state-run newspaper, Rising Nepal, warned of a ""historic blunder"" if the opposition parties failed to accept the king's offer.
A heavier than usual contingent of soldiers, armed with machine-guns, were posted every few hundred yards (metres) around the perimeter of the royal palace, an AFP said.
Mobile phone services remained cut for more than 24 hours, a frequent tactic of the royal regime during times of crisis.
Groups of several thousand gathered at points on the ring road around the city. In the east of the city, some 5,000 gathered calling for a republic to end the Shah dynasty that has ruled the Himalayan kingdom for nearly 240 years.
They chanted: ""King leave the country"", ""Abolish the kingship"" and ""We want true democracy"" but chatted to police and brandished olive branches.
Umesh Prasai, a 21-year-old businessman, said the protests were ""more friendly"" on Sunday. ""We're too tired,"" he said.
The crisis was sparked by Gyanendra's decision to sack the government on February 1 last year, saying it was corrupt and had failed to stem a 10-year Maoist revolt that has left more than 12,500 dead.

 Kathmandu, 2 September: Nepalese working in the Middle East have urged an immediate stoppage of the violence that erupted after the brutal killing of 12 Nepalese in Iraq. If the violence continues, they have said, this could affect their present jobs.
 The Nepalese are worried that the recruitment agencies and people in the Gulf, after finding out about the violence in Nepal, might change their opinion about the Nepalese. Gopal Ghimire, a Nepalese national working in Saudi Arabia, in talking on the phone with Kantipur said that attacks on religious shrines and businesses could generate negative views against the Nepalese in the Gulf. ""We urge both the government and the demonstrators not to let any untoward incident happen,"" he said.

Over 600,000 Nepalese work in the Gulf region and their average wage is less than 100 US dollars a month. The Nepalese government doesn't allow Nepalese to work for less than 100 US dollars. They earn nearly 66bn rupees a year, of which they spend half in the Gulf countries and send half - 33bn rupees - home.

"4725",20061470,"Title: Nepal king's election call dismissed.rtf; Date: April 14, 2006 Friday 7:57 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's king renewed a pledge Friday to hold elections following intense pro-democracy protests, but political parties sidelined when he seized power dismssed the promise.
King Gyanendra said in a midnight message marking Nepal's New Year ""there is no alternative to multiparty democracy"" and expressed a desire for ""an exemplary democratic exercise like general elections"" but mentioned no dates for a poll.
The pledge failed to defuse tensions in the kingdom shaken by a week of widespread protests in which hundreds of demonstrators were arrested and four killed by security forces.
Krishna Prasad Sitaula, spokesman for the Nepali Congress party, vowed no let-up in protests to force Gyanendra to relinquish absolute power.
The king had justified his power grab 14 months ago by saying politicians had failed to tackle a bloody Maoist insurgency that has claimed 12,500 lives.
""Our peaceful movement will continue with more vigour in the days ahead,"" Situala said, but announced no protest plans for Friday, New Year's Day in Nepal.
The king called for ""political parties to join in a dialogue ... to contribute towards actviating the multiparty democratic polity.""
Krishna Khanal, politics professor at Tribhuvan University, rejected Gyanendra's call for elections as too little, too late.
""It's natural for the parties to dismiss it because the people's pressure is intense,"" he said. People have come into the streets ""to bring a real change,"" Khanal said.
""The movement will not stop now as different strata of society have already come onto the streets.""
The protest movement began with just political activists and students but spread to doctors, engineers, lawyers, journalists and even government employees.
Earlier this week Maoist leader Prachanda urged security forces to turn against the king, saying: ""The birth of a new democratic regime will develop a new democratic military force.""
Minendra Rijal, spokesman for the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party, another member of the seven-party opposition alliance, said the monarch's elections pledge was a ""non-starter.""
""It's very clear the king is firm in his own roadmap. He has taken the people's power and he is not going to concede,"" he said.
The king's address made no direct mention of the Maoists who have been fighting a ""People's War"" for the last decade aimed at toppling the king. They have formed a loose alliance with pro-democracy parties.
""The rebels are an integral part of any possible solution to the spiralling crisis in Nepal,"" said S.M. Habibullah, head of the political science department at Tribhuvan University.
""Theyhave their own manifesto but since they have joined in with the demands of the mainstream parties, they should be given a chance to join the mainstream,"" he said.
When the king seized power, he promised to quell the Maoist insurgency and hold general elections by April 2007.
But since then, analysts say, the security situation has worsened and republican support grown in the Hindu kingdom, where the monarch is revered by many as the incarnation of the god Vishnu the protector.

"1284",20032751,"Title: Soldiers kill 11 Maoist rebels at a school in Nepal ; four students die in battle.rtf; Date: October 14, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Soldiers stormed a high school after it was taken over by Maoist rebels and battled the insurgents for hours while terrified students took cover behind desks, officials and witnesses said Tuesday. Eleven rebels and four students were killed, the army said.
Five students also were injured in the violence Monday in the remote mountain village of Mutuhara, about 600 kilometer (375 miles) northeast of the capital, Katmandu.
An army official at the regional headquarters in Nepalgunj said that the students were killed and injured by a grenade set off by the rebels during the fighting. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said soldiers stormed the building after hearing that the rebels had taken control of it.
Dambari Dika, 17, who was injured in the fighting, said the rebels entered the school and forced the students to gather in an assembly hall. The insurgents were planning to give a lecture there when soldiers stormed the building, she said.
""We were all scared. We told the rebels not to come inside the school but they refused,"" Dika told The Associated Press from a hospital in Nepalgunj, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of Katmandu.
Dika said students were frightened and confused when the soldiers stormed the building, and that she did not know who killed her classmates. She took cover behind a desk, but was shot in the leg.
Her 13-year-old sister Meena died.
The battle between the soldiers and the rebels lasted for at least four hours. There were no casualties on the army side, the army official said.
The injured students were flown to the hospital on army helicopters and were receiving treatment. Doctors at the hospital said they were in stable condition.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since last week when a nine-day cease-fire imposed by the rebels during the Hindu Dasain festival expired.
Nearly 400 people have died since the rebels pulled out of peace talks and a seven-month cease-fire in August.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. The government has labeled them terrorists.
More than 7,400 people have been killed since the insurgency began.
Meanwhile, suspected rebels fatally shot a government employee in Katmandu on Tuesday.
The man, identified as Anil Chaudhari, worked at the Central Wool and Carpet Development Board. He was shot by two assailants police believe to be members of the rebel group. Chaudhari was driving toward a parking lot when he was shot.

"5321",20062043,"Title: Indian Police Blame Pakistan for Blasts.rtf; Date: September 30, 2006 Saturday 8:57 PM GMT; Text: An Indian investigator on Saturday blamed Pakistan's spy agency of orchestrating the July train bombings that killed at least 207 people in Mumbai, an accusation that could threaten the already shaky peace process between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
Pakistan's minister of state for information, Tariq Azim, immediately denied the allegation, calling it ""irresponsible"" and demanding that India provide evidence of the link.
India called a halt to the often-stumbling, two-year-old peace talks with Pakistan in the wake of the bombings, which ripped through a series of suburban commuter trains during evening rush hour on July 11, killing at least 207 people and wounding 700.
Negotiations resumed earlier this month when Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf on the sidelines of a conference in Cuba. The two agreed to set up a joint mechanism to combat terrorism.
Mumbai Police Commissioner A.N. Roy, the lead investigator in the bombings, said Pakistan's Directorate of Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, began planning the attacks in March and later provided funding and training for the bombers in the Pakistani town of Bahawalpur, a center of militant Islamic activity.
""The conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan,"" he said at a news conference.
Roy said the attacks were carried out by the Pakistan-based Islamic militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, with help from the Students Islamic Movement of India, a banned Muslim organization.
He said 15 people have been arrested so far, including 11 Pakistanis. Three Indians are still on the run, he added, and another Pakistani bomber was killed in the blasts.
Roy offered no evidence to support the link, but said it was revealed during the questioning of suspects who had been drugged with a ""truth serum"" to force them to divulge information. He didn't describe what the drug was or how it worked.
Top Indian government officials did not comment on Roy's accusation.
Pakistan has in the past denied involvement in the attacks and it was not immediately clear how the revelations would affect the fragile peace process. A 2001 attack on India's Parliament, blamed on the same agency, almost pushed India and Pakistan to war.
""Whenever some bad thing happens in India, they start blaming us for it,"" said Azim, the Pakistani official. ""Such allegations only give benefit to the real culprits, who escape arrests.""
Spokesmen for the outlawed Lashkar-e-Tayyaba group were not available for comment.
The allegation came days after the British Broadcasting Corp. reported that a document prepared for Britain's Defense Ministry accused ISI of indirectly supporting terrorist groups including al-Qaida. Musharraf strongly rejected the leaked document.
Roy described an elaborate network that helped the militants carry out the bombings.
He said they slipped into India after training in Bahawalpur, some directly from Pakistan, others through neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh. They were then met by Indians who brought them to Mumbai and housed them in rented apartments, Roy said.
The bombs were made by packing smuggled high-grade RDX explosives with ammonium nitrate into pressure cookers. Teams of two one Indian and one Pakistani took the bombs onto the trains where they were set off by timers, he said.
""It was a professional, precise and well-planned operation,"" he said.
Police cracked the case after tracing a suspicious call from Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, to the Nepal border region, Roy said. There, they picked up one of the suspects, who led them to others.
Pakistan and India have a long history of bitter relations and their border remains heavily militarized. They have fought three wars two over the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is among more than a dozen Muslim groups that have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir's independence from India or its merger with Pakistan. More than 68,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

 After the arrest of our party's standing committee member and senior leader Comrade Kiran (Mohan Baidya) from Siliguri by the Indian reactionary regime, it has created a big outcry in national and international level. Enemies of revolution have been encouraged by this arrest, while this has created an anger and a feeling of revenge among the leftists and patriotic forces. Also this incident is seen to have created important questions and curiosities in various circles.  passage omitted
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Apr 04, p4
After all what could be the reason behind the arrest of Comrade Kiran at this very period? Does this have any relation with the attack by People's Liberation Army on Bhojpur on 2 March and on Beni on 20 March, grand preparation for Nepal banda general shutdown on 6, 7 and 8 April by party, army and front? We think there is a relation . Because especially after the Beni operation, the dream of the reactionaries to militarily crush us has been shattered.  passage omitted: Beni operation is a milestone in the strategic counterattack of the people's war.
 In the new phase of revolution, it should not be difficult for anyone to understand that Kiran's sudden arrest is the sum of the real situation of the development of people's war and exigency.
 And the happening of this incident on the eve of the anti-monarchy movement of parliamentary parties that started from 1 April and the speedy advancement of the revolutionary movement has once again helped reveal the plot that there is an unholy alliance between the reactionary rulers of Nepal and India.  passage omitted
 At a time when the pro-parliamentarian and republican forces are readying for a decisive movement, if Comrade Kiran has been manhandled with an internal agreement to sign anti-national agreements on important rivers including Karnali and other issues of military importance, then the rulers of Nepal and India will have to pay a good price for that.  passage omitted
 In sum, however painful the arrest of Comrade Kiran may be for us now, it is an indication that Nepal's people's revolution has attained a new height and in that sense, we must pay enough heed to changing this negative incident into positive revolutionary energy. The arrest of our senior comrade has created hatred and anger against national and international enemies; it has created hatred and anger among not only our party rank and file but also among the general populace. And it is sure to add fuel to the flame of people's revolution. As Comrade Mao said the boulder lifted by the reactionaries against people will ultimately fall on their own feet, and here also it is sure to happen. No history tells us that revolutionary ideology can be murdered and jailed. Though Comrade Kiran, who is physically not well, is in the hands of enemies, his revolutionary ideology will always provide energy to our movement.

[Presenter] Normalcy has not returned to Rautahat District, which became tense after a violent clash between the Madhesi People's Rights Forum [MPRF] and the Maoist-affiliated Madhesi National Liberation Front [MNLF] yesterday. The headquarters of the district, Gaur, remains closed today. [passage omitted]
Our correspondent in Rautahat, Shiva Puri, gives more information by phone:
[Shiva Puri] Home Minister Krishna Sitaula has arrived in Rautahat to inspect the site of yesterday's clash between the MPRF and Maoist workers. Accompanying Sitaula are CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara, human rights leaders Padma Ratna Tuladhar and Subodh Pyakurel, Nepali Congress leader Aftab Alam, CPN-UML's Dr Bansi Dhar Mishra and OHCHR-Nepal chief Lena Sundh. 
The death toll in yesterday's incident has reached 28. Maoist lawmaker Prabhu Sah alleged that only five people were killed in the clash and the rest were killed by MPRF workers after capturing them. Sah alleged that MPRF had used Indian bandits in the killings. 
The body of the dead Maoist [the 28th victim] is at Gaur hospital. Some of the bodies recovered by police after the clash are charred beyond recognition. [passage omitted]
The Maoists say the death toll could rise as many Maoist workers are still out of contact. Gaur market remains closed and only security personnel can be seen on the streets. 
Human rights workers have condemned the incident. Home Minister Sitaula has directed security bodies to bring the situation to normal. Until now only 18 of the dead Maoists have been identified. This is Shiva Puri for Kantipur FM in Rautahat.
[Presenter] Meanwhile, fearing that an abnormal situation could arise due to the Rautahat incident, the [neighbouring] Bara district administration has imposed a curfew in Kalaiya, the headquarters of the district, from 12 p.m. until further notice today. The eastern regional administrator, police chiefs and chief district officers in the region are discussing how to bring normalcy to the region. [passage omitted]

An Indian envoy dispatched to Nepal in the wake of violent anti-king protests said Friday he expects a ""major announcement"" to be made soon on restoring democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
""It is our hope and expectation that perhaps by the end of the day some major announcement will be made,"" Karan Singh said after briefing Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his recent visit to Nepal.

India, a regional power, has considerable influence over its smaller neighbor, Nepal.
More than two weeks of often violent protests and a general strike against palace rule have paralyzed the Himalayan country, leaving cities short of food and fuel and Nepal at its most volatile since Gyanendra seized power 14 months ago.

  Superintendent of Police Vinod Kumar said the truck was intercepted near Makhor village, which falls under the Akbarpur Police Station's jurisdiction. 
  Around 8,640 detonators, 6,000-kg gelatin wire, 10-kg fuse wire and three sets of cell phones were recovered. A Maruti van was also seized along with the truck, Kumar said. 
  The seized truck was coming from Guna in Madhya Pradesh and the explosives were to be delivered to the naxalite infested areas of Sheikhpura, Jamui, Lakhisarai and Munger, he added. 
  The arrested are being interrogated. 
  The Year 2007 witnessed a rise in overall fatalities in Left Wing Eextemism (LWE)-related incidents in Bihar. 
  According to provisional data, 49 fatalities were recorded in 2007, as compared to 51 fatalities in 2006. Whereas fatalities among the Maoist ranks remained at comparable low levels, there was a sharp dip in civilian fatalities (down from 40 to 23), with a corresponding and alarming rise in security forces (SF) ranks, registering more than a four-fold increase - at 21, up from five in 2006. 
  The dominance of the Maoists in the State was demonstrated in the proliferation of 'swarming attacks' - coordinated assaults by large numbers of Maoist cadres and 'people's militia', principally on Police and SF posts, camps and establishments. 
  Of the 42 swarming attacks conducted by the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) through out the country in 2007, 12 took place in Bihar alone. Significantly, there were just nine swarming attacks by the Maoists across the country, in 2006, of which only one was located in Bihar. 
  Interestingly, at the beginning 2007, Bihar was being projected as a 'success story'. The State witnessed a decline in LWE-related activities from an alarming 323 incidents in 2004 to 186 in 2005 and to a further 107 in 2006.
  The Maoist dominance is well documented and officially confirmed. According to a March 2007 Bihar Police document, 30 of the State's 38 Districts are currently affected by Maoist activities. Nine of these have been designated 'hyper-sensitive'. A further nine Districts fall into the 'sensitive' category, while the remaining 12 Districts are categorised 'less sensitive'. 
  According to the Institute for Conflict Management's database, Maoist activities - though not necessarily Maoist violence - in 2006 and 2007 (till December 20), was reported from 32 Districts. While Maoist influence has been most visible over the southern and central Districts, the northern Districts, sharing border with Nepal, have also been witnessing increasing mobilisation as well as the actual orchestration of attacks, indicating a comprehensive expansion of the Maoist strength across the State's geographical spread. 
  Bihar remains a critical centre for the Maoist strategic outreach. In spite of significant arrests, the at least 2,500 strong cadre of the CPI-Maoist has found it easy to retain its strongholds in the State.

"1343",2004250,"Title: Nepal daily urges parties to express opinions on UN mediation.rtf; Date: March 22, 2004, Monday; Text: Excerpt from editorial entitled: ""The UN and the question of mediation""; published by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 22 March
 No one has denied the fact that the only solution to the country's conflict is peace talks. The government has been repeatedly saying it is always ready for talks while the Maoists also have not negated the proposal for talks. The forces that respect the present constitution, the NGOs, INGOs international non-government organizations , human rights activists and even the civic society have been saying there is no alternative to talks.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Mar 04, p 1
At a time when the cease-fire and talks have dominated the discussions, a new debate has started - UN mediation in resolving Nepal's conflict. This proposal has come from the rebel side and they are firm on their stance. Although this proposal seemed pleasant to the ears, it has now become a part of the conflict.
 The government hasn't agreed to the proposal while the informal reaction of the parties agitating in the streets is mixed. They have not made public their formal reaction. Intellectual from the Nepali Congress and foreign relations expert Dr Ram Sharan Mahat, with some basic logic, argued that UN mediation would not be acceptable in Nepal. In diplomatic language, the US ambassador to Nepal, Michael E. Malinowski, also said Nepalese themselves are capable of resolving the internal conflict. What do the Nepalese people think? No one is able to say. But it is not difficult to assume that they want peace with sovereignty intact, whosoever makes the effort.  passage omitted
 At a time when the conflict has heated up, it is not bad to see the peace talks dominating the public discussions. But the confusion has increased due to lack of expressed opinion by the concerned parties. For those supporting and objecting to the role of neutral parties in conflict resolution, it is important that they make their opinions public. It is important for the government and those agreeing with government's opinion to make public their opinion as to why the neutral party's role is unacceptable, while those supporting a neutral party's role also need to make their opinion public. Let it not be like the proverb ""Seven villages get inundated while discussing with boatmen.""

Ten soldiers and 16 rebels were killed in the fighting, army officers at the site and at army headquarters in Katmandu, the national capital, said on the customary condition of anonymity.
The clash took place in the mountainous Pandol area in Kailali district, 600 kilometers (480 miles) west of Katmandu, the officers said. Bodies of 16 rebels were recovered and there were believed to be more militant casualties, they said.
Six security personnel were killed at the same place last week.
The rebels have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Fighting between the rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and government forces has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last year.

""The government has adopted a policy to reduce poverty by eight percent in the current five-year plan,"" The Rising Nepal newspaper on Monday quoted spokesman Kamal Thapa as saying.
The government's economic policy is poor-oriented and has introduced social reforms and good governance to achieve the target, Thapa said.
He urged both the governmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate and support the government's poverty alleviation policy.
Poverty is a serious threat to peace and stability, leading to increased chaos, violence, killings and terrorism, he noted, adding, ""Until and unless we alleviate poverty, we cannot defeat terrorism.""
Of Nepal's total population, 38 percent live below the poverty line and 37 percent earn less than one US dollar a day.

"5821",20071107,"Title: Priest fights to save tiny Bangladeshi tribe.rtf; Date: June 13, 2007 Wednesday 2:02 PM GMT; Text: A HALF-CENTURY AGO, Rev. Eugene Homrich moved to Bangladesh and set up a Catholic mission among a tiny pagan tribe clinging to a tropical forest.
He is still here. As a result, perhaps, so are the Garo people.
A native of Muskegon, Michigan, Father Homrich has founded schools and built clinics for the Garos, most of whom have converted to Christianity. Once, he personally delivered a baby on the back of his motorcycle. During Bangladesh's bloody civil war in 1971, he stockpiled explosives in his mission and narrowly avoided execution. Now, Father Homrich is confronting the country's forestry department to stem illegal logging of the Modhupur forest, the Garos' ancestral homeland.
To the chagrin of the local administration, the blunt, portly American has become the de-facto leader of some 20,000 tribe members. ""If it weren't for the father we'd be in a sea of trouble,"" says Simon Marak, a Garo community activist. ""By his grace we're living here.""
But there is only so much Father Homrich can still do for the Garos. He is turning 79 this year, and recently spent several months in the U.S. for medical treatment. He can be expelled from the country at any time. And despite his efforts, the Modhupur forest has shrunk through logging and development to some 60,000 square kilometers, one-tenth its size in the 1950s.
As the country's population keeps soaring, conflict between the Garos and land-hungry outsiders intensifies. The world's third-largest Muslim nation, Bangladesh packs 150 million people into a Nepal-size territory.
In recent years, more than a dozen tribe members have been killed by forestry officers and soldiers because of land disputes, say Garo leaders and human-rights groups in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. In March, the Garos say, a prominent tribal activist, Cholesh Ritchil, was tortured to death while in army custody, an incident that sparked a wave of outrage in Bangladesh and prompted protests from Western embassies.
Shaken by the killing, Father Homrich says it is only a matter of time before the Garos' unique culture disappears from Modhupur. ""The future for them is in the city, or in India. There is no future here in the jungle,""n to a factory worker, Father Homrich was fascinated by tales of Catholic missionaries who often visited his primary school. He prepared for missionary work at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and at the Holy Cross College in Washington. The Holy Cross, a Catholic congregation, had one mission abroad at the time, in what is now Bangladesh.
The young priest arrived here in 1956, equipped with knowledge of the Bengali language and tropical agriculture. The country was still part of Pakistan, its population less than one-third of today's level. Since ethnic Bengalis usually follow Islam or the Hindu religion, Christian missionaries sought new converts in outlying tribal areas populated by non-Bengali minorities. The Modhupur forest was one of the closest such areas, a half day's drive by car from Dhaka.
In the late 1950s, the forest still teemed with monkeys, deer and leopards. Some 25,000 Garo people made their home here, in an enclave separated from South Asia's larger community of Garos people ethnically and linguistically related to Tibetans and Burmese, and concentrated in India's Meghalaya state. Moving to the Modhupur forest alone, Father Homrich established a new mission deep in the jungle.
Most of the Garos whom Father Homrich encountered followed animist cults, sacrificing chicken and goats to shrines of multiple gods. Living in small huts, they followed slash-and-burn agriculture on a rotation that anthropologists say gave the forest time to recover.
He was immediately won over by the Garos' serene demeanor. ""These are wonderful people,"" he said, as smiling tribal women in colorful saris sweep leaves from the mission's garden. ""They have an inner peace that is amazing in this messy country. They live in the eye of God.""
The jungle was a deadly place at the time. Malaria, scabies, intestinal parasites and a lethal black fever, known in the West as visceral leishmaniasis, claimed lives almost daily. Father Homrich taught villagers to dig wells and set up separate outhouses, and provided rudimentary medical services at a mission clinic.
The priest was also accepted as a member of the tribe soon after arrival, and became intimately involved in running the tribal affairs.
The peace was shattered in March 1971, when the country sought independence from Pakistan. Pakistani troops assisted by Islamist militias responded with a bloody crackdown, and most ethnic Bengali soldiers deserted. On an April morning, Father Homrich woke up to find two Indian Army officers sipping tea on his porch. India, as an enemy of Pakistan, supported Bangladesh's independence bid. The officers had come to help organize the local insurgency.
Father Homrich embraced the guerrillas, stockpiling India-supplied arms and explosives at the mission. The Pakistanis shelled his"

He met Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh in New Delhi and sought assistance by way of Air Force helicopters to be pressed into the service.
""Three helicopters are already air dropping food materials but it will not make much difference. More and more Air Force helicopters should be pressed into crisis management and more boats to rescue those who are trapped and taken to safe area if we rely on the State government assistance we will be responsible for the death of thousands more to be killed in this flood,"" Prasad said.
According to reports, floods have caused large-scale loss of life and property in six eastern districts of the state following an over 2,000-metre breach in the Kosi embankment in the Nepal region.
The swollen Kosi River breaking its embankments and changing course has ravaged many villages, affecting over a million people in Bihar.
The river flows from Nepal to India and is known as the 'Sorrow of Bihar' for the havoc it wreaks in many districts of the state each year.
According to reports, thousands of people have taken shelter on rail tracks and canals banks and other elevated places.
The three districts of Saharsa division, as well as parts of Purnia and Bhagalpur divisions, have been most adversely impacted. The affected districts are Saharsa, Supaul, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Araria, Katihar and Madhepura.
People in Araria said that they are managing with couple of boats provided by the local legislators as the district officials failed to provide any help.
""We met the District Magistrate who said that boats will be brought into service but no help came. The local legislator has provided some boats and we are traveling by these,"" said a flood-victim Kumar Ravi Shankar.
Thousands of villagers are forced to live like refugees in the wake of monsoon floods that have swept across large expanses including agricultural fields and human habitations of the region.
Many parts of India have received heavy monsoon rains this year, causing houses to collapse and flood waters to flow across large areas of agricultural land.
India's annual monsoon hits in June every year and retreats in September.
Despite its destructive spree, monsoon is key to irrigating 60 per cent of farmland and to driving economic growth in a nation heavily reliant on agriculture.

"224",20031724,"Title: Report_ Former prime minister threatens to expose 'grand design' behind Nepal palace massacre.rtf; Date: January 2, 2003 Thursday; Text: Former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has threatened to expose what he says was a ""grand design"" behind the 2001 assassinations of the king, queen and eight other members of the royal family, a newspaper reported Thursday.
Koirala, the president of the Nepali Congress party, said he has maintained his silence on the issue because he feared his revelations would result in fresh unrest in the Himalayan kingdom, the Kathmandu Post reported.
Koirala's party was ousted from government by the new king last year, though he was not prime minister at the time.
""I deliberately choose to keep (quiet), but I will expose everything at an opportune time â¦ the time is not far away,"" the Post quoted Koirala as saying.
King Birendra, Queen Aiswarya and eight other members of the royal family were shot dead in the Narayanhiti Royal Palace on June 1, 2001. A government investigation found that Crown Prince Dipendra, high on drugs and alcohol, carried out the shootings before killing himself.
Koirala's comments came two days before King Gyanendra, brother of the slain King Birendra, was to make a public appearance in Koirala's hometown of Biratnagar, 500 kilometers (312 miles) east of Katmandu.
Gyanendra assumed power after the massacre and has been gaining support of the people, despite firing the elected Nepali Congress government in October and replacing it with a pro-monarchy prime minister and Cabinet.
Security has been beefed up with soldiers and policemen mobilized in the industrial city near the Indian border, where the king was expected to address the gathering.
Thousands of people were expected to attend, despite threats and a general strike called by the Maoist rebels fighting to end the monarchy and democratic parliament.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to turn Nepal into a communist state. More than 7,000 people have been killed in the insurgency.

Text of report by privately-owned Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 1 October
Kalikot, 1 October: With Dashain festivities already on, people of remote Kalikot District are facing acute shortage of daily consumables as the supply of goods has been closed for the past three months.
Supply of daily commodities to the district was cut off after the Surkhet-Jumla section of Karnali Highway was obstructed due to heavy rainfall in July, causing prices of available stock of food to skyrocket instantaneously. The highway is yet to come into operation.
Local grocer Bishnu Jaisi says: ""Everything I had in stock has finished, but there is no sign of the highway becoming operational any time soon.""
Small-time shopkeepers in the district say they cannot afford to order supplies by helicopters as the costs are prohibitive. An airline company charges 80 rupees [approx 1.10 US] per kilo for all goods consigned to the district from Surkhet. A few suppliers who are bringing in goods through helicopters are charging exorbitantly to make up for the money spent on cargo fare.
A kilo of coarse rice, which was sold for 28 rupees before the highway was cut off, now costs 50. Similarly, cooking oil which cost 120 rupees per litre is now being sold at 190. Kerosene, which was available at 75 rupees per litre, has soared to 150. So have the prices of other items, including pulses, biscuit, sugar, spices and soaps gone up.
Meanwhile, some locals have accused shopkeepers of creating artificial shortage to take advantage of the festival season. They say local shopkeepers are hiding their supplies so that they can make high profits.
More than a dozen VDCs [village development committee areas] in Darchula District of the far west are also reeling under food shortage as the regional office of Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) in Dhangadi has not supplied foodstuff since long.

 Dailekh mid-west Nepal , 17 December: Dozens of villages in eastern Dailekh have been completely deserted since Friday 17 December .

"7672",20115856,"Title: Allen's dark stranger.rtf; Date: January 22, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU: Woody Allen specialises in slice of life films in which the audience gets to look into the situations faced by a group of characters.
Aided by commentary, typical of this genre of film and based on the Shakespeare quote that life is full of sound and fury signifying nothing, You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger has its characters scuttling around looking for happiness despite their enviable lives with money, professions, culture. But in the end they are lonely.
These materially well-off fortunates need to be reflected as valuable in the eyes of somebody new, because they need reassurance. It can't all signify nothing, if you're important to someone. This someone must be a new person, because first, you and your current lover know each other too well, and second, you can project wonderful qualities on the new lover until you get to know that person too well. It is assumed all along, of course, that you are absolutely invaluable.
Allen has taken to seeing England as his good luck charm and this film is set in London.
Says Roger Ebert, ""The time is the present. The city, London, where people seem to live in one another's pockets more than in American cities. We meet an old lady named Helena (Gemma Jones) whose husband, Alfie (Anthony Hopkins), has left her for a floozy blonde. She seeks consolation from a medium who sees her floating in clouds of glory and predicts she will meet a very special man.
""Helena's daughter is Sally (Naomi Watts). Sally is married to Roy (Josh Brolin), whose first novel was a success and who has been living off her money ever since, while blaming her for writer's block. Meanwhile, the treacherous Alfie is spending a fortune on Charmaine (Lucy Punch), who is an 'actress' and reminds me of Ben Hecht's definition of actress: 'any woman under 30 who is not actively employed in a brothel, with many exceptions'. (His definition of actor: 'a waiter'.)
""Sally and Roy have fought about money and his unwritten second novel for so long they've lost interest in each other. Their eyes stray. Sally is drawn to her magnetic boss, Greg, who, as he is played by Antonio Banderas, makes it hard for us to blame her. Roy finds himself looking into the window of a flat across from his, where on display is the lovely Dia, who, as she is played by Freida Pinto from Slumdog Millionaire, makes it hard for us to blame him.
""The way Allen handles this is by a series of conversations in which paradoxes are illustrated by the search for happiness. Dia is remarkably sympathetic with Roy; it's not every subject of a Peeping Tom who introduces him to her parents. Charmaine is a floozy, but not entirely without a heart. The movie is forgiving. But the search for happiness is doomed by definition: You must be happy with what you have, not with what you desire, because the cost of the quest is too high.
""So consider old Helena. She doesn't meet a tall, dark stranger; she meets a short, stout one, he owns an occult bookshop, and they determine it was meant for them to be together. What more can you ask? The others are all too smart for their own good.""
Adds Robert Horton, ""While the cast is stocked with talented players, almost everybody looks slightly miscast, so the film doesn't seem to have an anchor anywhere. It comes to an interesting ending, but by then Allen's purpose seems increasingly casual - when what this roundelay really needs is urgency.""

The former rebels, now named the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), won the largest number of seats in elections last month for a constitution-drafting assembly and are likely to lead the new government.
Ambassador Nancy Powell met Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known as Prachanda, on Thursday, the embassy said. It was the first meeting between a U.S. official and the leader of the Maoists, which are still listed by Washington as a terrorist organization despite having abandoned their 10-year armed revolt and joining a peace process in 2006.
They have since joined mainstream politics and received the most seats in April 10 elections for a Constituent Assembly that will rewrite the constitution, decide Nepal's future political system and govern the nation.
Thursday's meeting was the first indication that Washington might remove the Maoists from its terrorist list and establish relations.
Little information was available about the meeting from either the embassy or the Maoists. Powell left Nepal on Friday to brief State Department officials about developments in the Himalayan nation.
""Powell provided an overview of current U.S. government assistance to Nepal designed to help create a more prosperous, democratic, and stable Nepal,"" the embassy said in a brief statement. ""She sought assurances that the new government would respect current donor agreements and ensure the safety of those implementing them.""
It said the ambassador also encouraged Prachanda ""to ensure that all Maoist organizations illustrate their commitment to the political process through their words and actions.""

But even such noble services lose much of its charm when conversion is the motive behind it."" Young India, February 26, 1925). Before the cure of leprosy was discovered, the segregation of leprosy parients was the only way doctors knew to control the disease. People with leprosy were brought to remote areas and left in isolation in the so-called leprosy asylum without having any hope of even being accepted back in the society. Gandhiji felt that such segregation and categorisation against a person suffering from a disease with no fault of their own was the worst kind of human rights violation. Disease could happen to any one. Leprosy is a disease caused by bacteria, but unfortunately leprosy sufferers are put in a certain category and treated miserably.
  In 1945, Professor TN Jagadison requested Mahatma Gandhi to open the door of a newly constructed leprosy asylum in South India. Gandhiji immediately refused to open the asylum and remarked - ""Opening a leprosy colony is not a big matter - but I shall come to close it."" After 55 years of Gandhiji's historic remark we have now realised that the leprosy colonies do not serve any purpose in controlling the disease and have stopped admitting leprosy patients in colonies. Most of the colonies are being wound up although there are only few cured leprosy-affected person in colonies of Assam who could not be sent back to their families due to gross deformities and long dissociation from their original society. WHO declared in 1960 that the isolation of leprosy was unnecessary. At present thousands of new leprosy cases are detected in developing countries and treated at their own home and not a single patient has been isolated at colonies. The Leprosy Control Programme has been integrated with general healthcare system and the leprosy patients have the same opportunity to attend any health institution and avail the services available to a person suffering from any communicable disease. After integration the leprosy patients have taken back the dignity which the society had once seized from them. Despite this, social stigma still prevails in the community and acts as a barrier in fulfilling Gandhiji's dream of ""Leprosy-free India.""
  Although the first drug against leprosy known as 'Dapsone' was discovered in late forties, it proved to be ineffective in controlling the disease burden because of prolonged treatment by this drug leading to poor drug compliance and drug resistance. The burden of leprosy was increasing globally, reaching a peak of 5.4 million cases in 1981 in 122 endemic countries of which India contributed 2.91 million cases with a prevalence rate of 57.6 cases per 10,000 people. The global leprosy burden dramatically reduced over the last two decades. This is one of the greatest achievements in public health in recent years. This is due to two historic events in the history of fight against leprosy. The first event took place in 1981, when a WHO study group on chemotherapy of leprosy recommended the use of Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) as the standard treatment for leprosy. The efficacy of this new drug therapy proved to be miraculous. It not only cures the patient within a very short period (6-12 months), but is also capable of killing 99.9 per cent of the bacteria causing leprosy after the first dose; thereby the infectious patient is made non-infectious so that the healthy population is protected from getting the disease. The success of MDT led to the second event in 1991, when the 4th World Health Assembly passed a resolution (WHA 44.9) declaring the commitment to eliminating leprosy as a public health problem by the end of '2000', i.e., achieving a prevalence of less than one case of leprosy per 10,000 population. The WHO declaration increased awareness and political commitment in all endemic countries and intensified the elimination activities.
  Today, out of 122 endemic countries, 118 countries have eliminated leprosy as a public health problem with a total case load of 2,29,867 as on January 2007 against 5.4 million cases in 1981. As of today, only four countries are yet to achieve the target set by the WHO, that of less than one case per 10,000 people at the national level. They are Nepal, Brazil, DR Congo and Mozambique.
  India has achieved the elimination target in December, 2005 and the case load came down to 82,801 in March 2007 from 2.91 million cases in 1981. Assam also achieved the elimination goal in March, 2001 and the total case load came down from 15395 cases in 1994 to 1026 cases in March 2007. Since the widespread introduction of MDT, enormous progress has been made to reduce the leprosy case load. Over 15 million people were cured of the disease globally after introduction of MDT. The WHO strategy has been a milestone, not the final destination. From elimination of leprosy as a public health prob"

The activists were subjected to rigorous checks by the army at check posts and bus terminals to ensure they were not carrying arms or explosives, Maoist sources said.
The meeting was the first in the capital since the Maoists turned their back on multi-party politics and began their struggle for a republic in 1996.
The insurgency has cost more than 7,800 lives.
On January 29 both sides declared a ceasefire and last month they signed a code of conduct for peace talks, but a date for negotiations to start has not yet been fixed.
The supporters and curious members of the public braved the heat to gather at the meeting venue, the Open Air Theatre, which was lavishly decorated with Maoist flags.
The rebel's chief negoiator, Babu Ram Bhattarai, arrived in Kathmandu on Friday coming out of seven years of hiding.
""We are going to explain to the public about our planned peace dialogue with the official team,"" he told AFP before the function began.
The main speakers at the meeting were Bhattarai and fellow Maoist leaders, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Matrika Yadav and Krishna Bahadur Mahara.
""We declared the ceasefire on give and take conditions,"" Bhattarai told the crowd.
""The people no more trust the palace and the political parties including the Nepali Congress, the Nepal Communist Party-United-Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) and the rightist National Democratic Party (NDP),"" he said.
""This is the reason why we captured almost all the rural regions. The authorities have only the control of the urban areas and Kathmandu.""
His fellow leader, Yadav, despite the ceasefire, did not tone down his rhetoric.
He warned that if the peace talks failed, the rebels would ""return to the jungle"" and resume their war.
""If the government does not pay proper attention to the people's voice and address the people's problem and the national interest properly, we may go back to the jungle for the struggle,"" he said, to loud cheers from the crowd.
""We have already proved in seven years of people's war our strength and the people's support to our struggle and have brought large areas under our control.
""We have not yet captured the capital city. If we launch another struggle we will capture it,"" he said.
Mahara reiterated that the Maoists wanted a new constitution and a republic system of government.
On Tuesday rebel sources said the talks were being delayed by the government's failure to announce an official negotiating team.
A previous ceasefire between the government and the rebels in 2001 broke down after three rounds of talks.

""The party has decided to recall Land Reforms and Management Minister Prabhu Shah due to the furore in parliament which is bound to affect the peace process and the drafting of the new constitution,"" Ram Rijan Yadav, media advisor to Bhattarai, told journalists on Sunday after damage-control consultations among the premier, Maoist party chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and the tainted minister himself.
Soon after the meeting, Prachanda issued a terse statement, saying Shah was being recalled, despite having been absolved by the authorities, due to the tussle in parliament, which has remained obstructed since yesterday due to protests by the Nepali Congress and the government's former ally, the communists, who are pressing for Shah's ouster.
Shah, ironically a former law minister, came under a cloud this year after police arrested two men, including his aide, for the murder of Kanshi Nath Tiwari, leader of Hindu Yuva Sangh, a militant, pro-monarchy Hindu organisation. It shot to notoriety in 2009 when it tried to break up an indefinite bandh called by the Maoists, who were then out of power.
Tiwari led a mob in Birgunj town that attacked a peaceful Maoist demonstration and assaulted senior leaders, including Shah, who was then a member of parliament. Last year, two motorcycle-borne assailants gunned down Tiwari in broad daylight and despite denials, the Maoists were suspected of having undertaken the retaliatory attack.
Last month, police arrested two men who claimed Shah had ordered the killing. One of them, who drive the getaway vehicle, was the minister's aide. However, police feared to issue a warrant for Shah's arrest or even begin an investigation into his involvement and the Maoists called it a politically motivated smear campaign. With Bhattarai scheduled to begin his visit to India, where he enjoys a clean image, from Thursday, the parliament uproar was a visible thorn in the government's flesh.
However, though the Maoists have decided to recall their own man, the dogged opposition is asking for more. They are also demanding the sacking of Defence Minister Sharad Singh Bhandari, who made a secessionist remark last month. Bhandari belongs to the bloc of Terai parties whose crucial support helped Bhattarai win the PM's election. If Bhandari's parties support him, the PM would put his neck on the block if he tries to sack the controversial minister.

'We call on the rebels to join the peace talks without any fear,' chief government negotiator Narayan Singh Pun said in a statement.
As far as the government is concerned, it has made full preparations to initiate the talks aimed at ending the Himalayan kingdom's seven-year-old insurgency, said Pun, who is also minister for physical planning and works.
Soon after the announcement of a ceasefire Jan. 29, the rebels named a five-member team comprising top leaders of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) for peace talks with the government.
But the team has not appeared in public yet as cases against team members, including senior leader Baburam Bhattarai, lie pending at Nepalese courts.
Peace talks have yet to start although the two sides signed a 22-point code of conduct on Thursday last week.
The code enjoins the Nepalese government to provide safety and security to the rebels during negotiations.
Two other rebel leaders -- Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dinanath Sharma -- have, however, recently met leaders of mainstream political parties in a move to pave the way for peace talks.
The rebels, waging an armed insurgency, say they want to try realize their objective of establishing a communist republic in Nepal through a peaceful dialogue.

""The government should seriously focus its attention on ecotourism in view of its high development potential,"" said the chairman of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), Ang Tsering Sherpa.
""As Nepal's vast rural areas are rugged mountain terrains endowed with scenic beauty they hold out good prospects for the development of ecotourism,"" added Suman Pandey, chairman of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal (TAAN).
""If ecotourism is promoted in those places it will contribute significantly to poverty alleviation,"" he told an Eco-Trekking Workshop and Adventure Meeting organised by TAAN in Kathmandu.
Tek Bahadur Dangi, executive director of the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB), said Nepal's earnings from tourism represented 17 percent of total national earnings.
""Tourism is one of Nepal's important foreign exchange spinners. Last year, a total of 492,000 tourists visited Nepal and its earning from the tourism sector was estimated at 167 million dollars,"" he said. The figure does not include earnings from Indian tourists.
But tourism here is facing an uphill battle. The number of tourists, after reaching its highest level in 1999, dropped last year by close to 60 percent from 500,000 to 215,000, according to official figures.
Besides a Maoist insurgency, tourism has been dampened by a 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and the shocking massacre of the royal family in 2001.
Officials also attribute the fall to factors outside Nepal, including the slowdown of the global economy, the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Iraq war and the SARS outbreak in Asia.
But government officials said after massive publicity from celebrations marking the golden jubilee of the first ascent of Everest by Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Norgay Tenzing on May 29, 1953, they were planning further promotions.
""The government is planning to launch a promotional drive about rural areas of scenic beauty as well as their infrastructural development,"" said Shanker Koirala, undersecretary at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
He repeated a government proposal that within the next two years all Himalayan peaks in the kingdom will be opened for climbers.
""The tourism industry could thrive if the country's political situation improves and the government formulates a good tourism policy,"" Sherpa said.

King Gyanendra seized power on Feb. 1, imposing a state of emergency and suspending most civil liberties, claiming the move was necessary to quell a nine-year communist insurgency.
He lifted the state of emergency last weekend following international criticism of the power grab. The United States, a key ally that has provided millions of dollars in development and military aid to Nepal, welcomed the move but urged the king to restore full democracy.
Although Washington hasn't announced plans to suspend military aid, it has not provided any assistance in the past three months. Previously, it provided arms and anti-terrorism training to Nepalese soldiers.
India and Britain, Nepal's other key allies, have formally suspended military aid, but New Delhi recently showed a willingness to resume help to the Royal Nepalese Army.

The IPI's World Press Freedom Review ""documents the growing evidence of the war on terrorism's impact on press freedom around the world,"" the institute said in a press release.
""Across the globe, governments have used the war to justify their own short-term interests. While some additional security measures have been legitimate, many countries have enacted restrictive laws, reduced the free flow of information, arrested journalists, closed media outlets and suppressed dissenters, all in the name of terrorism,"" the report said.
""With 10 journalists killed in Europe, press freedom is under pressure, particularly in eastern Europe where governments victimize the media,"" said the journalism-monitoring group.
The IPI said ""almost every country in Europe has introduced new anti-terrorism laws after September 11 (attacks in the United States) and a number have inhibited the media's work.""
It said ""in Russia, where eight journalists were killed, a new draft law seeks to regulate the media during an attack by terrorists.""
""In Asia, with 13 journalists murdered, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines have proposed new anti-terrorism measures while, in Malaysia, the war on terrorism undermined efforts to repeal the notorious Internal Security Act,"" the report said.
It added that ""after securing the favour of the United States in the war on terrorism, countries such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan suppress the media with impunity.
""Terrorists and security forces in Nepal also deliberately targeted the media this year, but there were improvements in Sri Lanka,"" it said.
""Fuelled by conflict in Palestine and Israel, seven journalists were killed in the Middle East and North Africa, where countries routinely stifle dissent and free speech,"" the report said.
It said that ""in Iran, the struggle between conservatives and reformers has led to the closure of publications and harsh prison sentences for journalists.""
""Jordan has used the war on terrorism to tighten its restrictive penal laws while Tunisia and Saudi Arabia remain reluctant to loosen their grip on the Internet.""
Africa ""confronted by famine and wars"" had problems that ""transcend the war on terrorism,"" the report said.
Two journalists were killed last year in Africa, where ""leaders of impoverished countries seek new ways to stay in power.""

"1008",20033237,"Title: Amid yet another crisis, Nepal still mourns slain king Birendra.rtf; Date: June 1, 2003 Sunday; Text: Two years after the massacre of the royal family, Nepalese are nostalgic for the more liberal approach of the late king Birendra as the kingdom sinks into a fresh political crisis under his brother and successor Gyanendra.
Kathmandu has seen the most open protests against the monarchy since the end of absolute royal rule in 1990 following Gyanendra's dissolution of the elected government last October.
The major political parties, which have organised a series of street demonstrations, were Sunday holding emergency talks after Lokendra Bahadur Chand, Gyanendra's chosen prime minister, resigned Friday after less than eight months in power.
""Had Birendra been alive, the present political crisis would not have arisen,"" said Bhakendra Kumar Gyanwali, a social worker.
""The major parties are now going to the streets with anti-monarchy slogans and are even talking of setting up a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy,"" he said.
""The late king was concerned about people's reactions, while present King Gyanendra's behaviour shows him to be aggressive and obstinate.""
Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were shot dead after dinner at their Kathmandu palace on June 1, 2001, by a drunken crown prince Dipendra, who turned the gun on himself.
An official report said the troubled heir of the Shah dynasty had been incensed by his parents' rejection of his desired fiancee.
Gyanendra, who was out of Kathmandu at the time, was crowned after Dipendra died of his wounds following a reign of several days from his hospital bed.
Birendra was revered over his two decades on the throne and his photographs still grace many homes. But Gyanendra, with his more forceful interventions into political life, has rattled many nerves in Nepal.
""The statements and actions of Gyanendra give strong credence to the widely held suspicion that he doesn't want to play second fiddle to any other institution or any other person,"" said Kapil Shrestha, a professor and member of the National Human Rights Commission.
""King Birendra remains a larger than life figure even two years after his brutal assassination. We miss him especially after experiencing two years under his brother,"" Shrestha said.
He said Gyanendra's model seemed to be not his slain brother but his late father king Mahendra, who ruled as an absolute monarch.
Gyanendra on October 4, 2002, dismissed elected prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent"", and one week later appointed Chand. No major party agreed to serve in the king-anointed government.
The king has taken an especially hands-on approach in dealing with a Maoist insurgency, which was launched in February 1996 with the aim of toppling the constitutional monarchy.
A ceasefire was reached with the rebels one month after Gyanendra took office but collapsed within four months, unleashing a cycle of violence that left thousands dead.
In January 2003, Chand's government reached a new truce with the rebels and the two sides have held two rounds of peace talks. Analysts feel it is too early to judge whether the current peace process is a success.
According to political sources here, Gyanendra on Friday gave the major parties a 72-hour deadline to agree on a new prime minister.
However, in a sign of the parties' unease towards Gyanendra, they have made clear their campaign to restore ""democracy"" has not been called off.
For many Nepalese, it was Birendra's gentle style they miss most.
""The late king was always smiling. He was inquisitive about any important issue,"" said Yadav Khanal, a tour operator.
""We still feel a great vacuum in this country.""

Authorities feared violence while the rebels marked the anniversary of the 1996 start of their violent campaign to replace Nepal's monarch with a communist state.
The fighting has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
The Home Ministry, which is in charge of the security, said ""the government has intensified security for the safety of the general public and to maintain law and order in the country.""
The capital Katmandu has suffered a series of bomb blasts in recent days, and authorities have found and defused other bombs. On Friday, soldiers patrolled the streets, checked vehicles for explosives and set up road blocks on routes to the army and police headquarters.
The government also has set up hot lines and urged people to report any suspicious activities.
Hundreds of vehicles lined up at Chipledunga, the entry point to Katmandu, where soldiers checked each passenger of each vehicle.
Violence has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August. The rebels, who say they are inspired by the late Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, walked out of peace talks and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.
The government offered an amnesty to guerrillas in December, guaranteeing security, rehabilitation, family reunions, cash aid, free education and medical treatment for those who surrender.
Government spokesman Gopendra Pandey said a deadline for the amnesty has been extended to April 13.
He said 344 rebels have so far surrendered and denounced violence.

  The seminar was organised by Manav Sewa Sansthan at Gorakhpur Press Club.
  Delivering her views on this occasion, director of the South Asia Region of an international social organisation UNIFEM Archna Tamang called upon journalists to create awareness as also to generate public opinion against immoral and illicit trade of flesh and children. She said the organisation had started a campaign against gender-based violence, which can be checked with support of every section of the society.

 Birendranagar, 20 November: Maoists in their areas under control in Bheri-Karnali Midwestern zones have initiated a huge campaign. They are engaged in a four-month strategic counter-attack campaign with the slogan of ""mass militarization of people is our final phase of counter-attack"".
 According to reports received by Rajdhani, Maoists have launched the campaign in half a dozen districts including Surkhet, Kalikot, Dailekh and Jajarkot.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 21 Nov 04
A source at the Bheri-Karnali Autonomous Regional People's Government said that bridges over the Bheri river, located at east Surkhet in Jare and Ramghat, have been completely damaged to stop movement in the course of the campaign. The campaign is being launched, it is reported, by forwarding a ""one household, one person underground"" policy.  The policy apparently means every household will have to send at least one activist who is active enough that he is willing to remain underground, hidden from the eyes of the security forces .
 Additional fear has gripped the local residents with the launch of the campaign at a time when there is rumour that Birendranagar, the Surkhet District headquarters, will soon be attacked by Maoists .
 The source at the Maoist regional people's government has said that the new four-month campaign has the power not only to turn Birendranagar to ashes, but the whole country. Similarly, the source said that the Maoist war had not really been against the Nepalese government, as it was ""directly or indirectly against the Indian army"".
 According to a human rights activist of Surkhet, Maoist regional people's government member and commander of the 30th battalion (Sofan) had recently told him that they had a plan to capture the capital itself Kathmandu . He had told him that the People's Army would be in the front-line followed by the People's Militia and then by the people.
 According to the activist, Maoists have warned the Nepalese youth not to be recruited in the army and the police and that they would later have to face danger if they did.
 The Maoist Bheri-Karnali regional government is said to have told those who have been recruited to the Indian army to return home and eke out their livelihood from their own small farms. The Maoists have said that since the next phase of the war is against India, they will be creating obstructions to stop recruitment of Nepalese youth in the Indian army. Youths of several districts of the region have been running away from home under the cover of dark to escape the campaign. The trend began with the intensification of Maoist activities of making them go underground in the name of the ""final phase of the strategic counter-attack"".
 A group of ten youngsters who made the nightly escape from Kalikot District, without informing the Maoists, and arrived here to run away to India said, ""People have been harassed by the Maoist four-month campaign in Kalikot.""
 People of Dailekh, scared by the Maoist campaign, are reported to have initiated a struggle against the Maoists. Reports say that the Maoists have been training the people on military techniques to enable them to be able to retaliate against the security forces in the event they show their presence in their areas. Meanwhile, a Maoist military sources said that the rebel Maoists have increased their military strength in the Bheri-Karnali region.

"3519",2005740,"Title: Government deploys 150 paramilitary companies in 32 sensitive spots in Bihar.rtf; Date: September 15, 2005 Thursday 1:12 PM  EST; Text: New Delhi, Sept 15 -- The Union Home Ministry on Thursday deployed 150 companies of paramilitary forces in 32 districts of Bihar that have been marked as sensitive because of the looming Naxal threat ahead of assembly polls. 
  The deployed paramilitary forces include 75 companies of the Border Security Force (BSF), 65 of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and 10 of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force.
  The step has been  taken following an Intelligence Bureau report that recommended the deployment of extra forces in these sensitive areas, specifically along the Indo-Nepal border in Bihar. 
  Out of the marked 32 districts, the following eighth districts and its police stations were termed as highly sensitive? East Champaran, West Champaran, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Araria, Kishanganj, Sheohar and Supaul. 
  The IB report said that the situation in the state was precarious in terms of Naxal violence brought on by the rumoured  widespread retreat of governance here. 
  The report further said that the possibility of use of Naxals by the candidates contesting in the upcoming polls could not be ruled out. 
  Naxalites have been engaged in various criminal activities, including massacres, kidnapping, extortion. Their repeated activities were possible mainly due to the lack of good governance in the State, the report said.
  The 735 km porous Bihar-Nepal border is easily permeable. Bihar has eight districts and 54 police stations situated on the border. In the recent past, the Bihar police have arrested a number of Nepalese Maoists in the border districts of West and East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar and Madhubani. 
  Taking advantage of a general breakdown of law and order, the Nepalese Maoists have reportedly set up bases at several places along the border. Reports indicate the existence of training camps in the forests of Bagha in the West Champaran district, which has emerged as a safe haven for the Nepalese insurgents. 
  The Bihar police also suspect that some top leaders of the Nepalese Maoists, including Baburam Bhattarai, are hiding in Bihar. 
  Over the last two years there has been considerable growth in MCC activities in northern Bihar, bordering Nepal. It was earlier confined to south (now Jharkhand) and central Bihar, but has now extended to Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East and West Champaran and Muzaffarpur districts. All these districts either share a border with Nepal or are very close to it. The extremists have formed the Utpirit Mukti Vahini in bordering districts of Bettiah/ Bagha. 
  The expansion of the MCC activities in border areas and their deepening linkages with Maoists from Nepal fits into the concept of the CRZ. Given the performance of state institutions and preparedness of police in these areas, there is little evidence that the State government can neutralize the growing menace of Naxal violence in one of India?s most backward States. In all likelihood, Bihar will remain one of the prime theatres of left extremist violence in the country, which has serious security implications.

 Kathmandu, 25 May: India has decided to give the Royal Nepalese Army RNA a short take-off aeroplane, two military helicopters and more equipment. Southern neighbour India has been a major help in the war against Maoists.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 26 May 04 p1
A decision to this effect was reached between the Indian army and the RNA during a meeting in the capital in the first week of May. During the two-day meeting, the security officials informed the Indian army about their need for equipment.
 According to a source, the Indian security officials promised to give a short take-off aeroplane, two military helicopters (gunships), motor vehicles, military equipment and an extra ""training package"".
 The officials also pledged to give INSAS Indian Small Arms System rifles that are being used by Nepalese soldiers for personal use, communications equipment, mine and night vision devices, among other things. Likewise, an agreement was reached between the two sides on additional training to combat terrorism.
 However, director of the RNA's public relations office Brig-Gen Rajendra Thapa did not confirm the report. America, India and Britain have increased assistance to the RNA since the start of military deployment against the Maoists. India has already given four helicopters, 13,000 INSAS rifles and motor vehicles.
 According to the information received, 10,000 more INSAS rifles will arrive. The RNA is seeking light and modern rifles, hand radio sets, light bulletproof jackets, personal weapons such as hand grenades, rocket launchers, LMG light machine guns , surveillance and night vision devices.
 The RNA officials said that the two aircraft promised by Britain will come within two weeks. Security officers who will be using the planes, have already gone for training. There is an agreement on purchasing a Skytruck with Poland as well.

The new government and the Maoists reached a landmark power-sharing agreement last week, but Nepal's home minister has said that the interim government cannot be formed until the Maoists lay down their weapons.
""We are not going to disarm. But to create a conducive environment for constituent assembly elections we are willing to neutralise our weapons and our army under UN monitoring,"" rebel spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told AFP.
Under last week's agreement parliament will be dissolved and power shared in a new interim government, which is due to come into being within a month.
In the longer term the government has pledged to hold constituent assembly elections to form a a body that will permanently rewrite the constitution, and most likely remove the king from politics permanenetly.
King Gyanendra was forced to give up 14 months of direct rule in April after weeks of often bloody protests organized by political parties and the Maoists.
Mahara said the rebels would not use arms during the constituent assembly elections and called on the army to match the move. A ceasefire is currently in force.
""We are expecting UN monitoring and technical assistance for the management of arms from both sides,"" he said.
The question of the rebels laying down arms was not addressed in their eight-point agreement. But Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said on Wednesday the issue must be addressed before the power-sharing arrangement comes into effect.
""Formation of the interim government is not possible without settling the Maoists' arms issues,"" Sitaula said.
The Maoists have been fighting to install a communist republic for the past decade at the cost of more than 12,500 lives.

The Kathmandu District Court last August sentenced the 60-year-old French national, who preyed on Western tourists in Asia in the 1970s, to 20 years in jail after convicting him of the 1975 murder of the backpacker.
The Appellate Court upheld the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court after a five hour hearing, Sobhraj's lawyer Sanjiv Ghimire told AFP.
Sobhraj, dubbed ""The Serpent"" for his audacious escapes from the law, described the ruling as ""shocking.""
""I am going to move the apex (Supreme) court against the verdict after discussing the matter with my lawyer,"" Sobhraj, sporting a cream-coloured polo cap, a white shirt and a blue coat, told reporters in court.
Police had said a key factor in the conviction was an analysis of signatures under the name of Henricus Bintanja, whose Dutch passport Sobhraj allegedly used to enter and leave Nepal in 1975.
Bintanja and his fiancee Cornelia Hemker were strangled that year and their burned bodies were found in a ditch outside Bangkok.
""The airport disembarkation card and hotel registration from 1975, both made under the Dutch name, were kept as part of the investigation. The signature matched the handwriting of Sobhraj's French passport,"" a police investigator said after the conviction.

"5771",20071919,"Title: 4 bombs in Nepalese capital kill at least 2, wound 13.rtf; Date: September 2, 2007 Sunday 2:43 PM GMT; Text: Four bombs exploded almost simultaneously in and around Nepal's capital Sunday, killing at least two people in the first attack on Katmandu since a communist insurgency ended last year, authorities said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, two of which struck near the headquarters of Nepal's army. But suspicion quickly fell on the nearly half a dozen armed groups, all of them ethnic-based, operating in southern Nepal.
Apart from the two deaths, the bombs also wounded at least 13 people, seven of whom were hospitalized in a critical condition, said a spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, Baman Prasad Neupane.
The most powerful of the bombs appeared to be the one that exploded inside a moving bus about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the army headquarters in Katmandu at around 4 p.m. (1015 GMT)
An eyewitness, Ravin Shrestha, said the force of the blast momentarily lifted the bus off the ground. At least one schoolgirl, who was standing at a nearby bus stop, was killed in the explosion.
Another blast occurred minutes later along a nearby roadside, said Basu Nepal, a police officer.
Two more blasts took place on the outskirts of the city one in the district of Balaju, which killed one person, and the other near Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) southwest of Katmandu, Nepal said.
Despite the ongoing peace process with the Maoist rebels, who last year joined the government after a decade of fighting, there have been repeated outbreaks of violence in southern Nepal over the past year with at least 60 people killed in clashes between security forces and ethnic minority groups who say their region has been sidelined in favor of the more populated, mountainous north.
The groups, who want greater autonomy, more seats in the national legislature and a guaranteed number of representatives in the administration, have pressed their demands through strikes, transportation shutdowns and demonstrations.
Nepal's government reached a peace agreement on Thursday with one of the major ethnic groups fighting in the south, the Madhesi People's Rights Forum.
But a Home Ministry official, Ek Mani Nepal, warned last month that a half dozen armed groups were still operating in the region.
The government is trying to settle the conflicts with all the groups so that elections can be held in November for a special assembly that will draft a new constitution.
Rewriting the constitution was a key demand of the tens of thousands of protesters who repeatedly took to the streets in April 2006 demanding an end to the royal dictatorship of King Gyanendra.
The king seized absolute power a year earlier, saying he would bring order to a chaotic political scene and quell the communist insurgency, which killed nearly 13,000 people.
But the insurgency worsened, the economy faltered, and Gyanendra's heavy-handed tactics helped forge an alliance between the usurped political elite and communists. By April 2006, widespread discontent erupted into mass protests that forced Gyanendra to cede power.
Gyanendra was soon after stripped of all his power by an interim parliament, which is governing the country until the special assembly is elected. The assembly will decide on what, if any, role the monarchy should have when it writes the new constitution.

"182",2003665,"Title: Nepal political parties respond to king's speech.rtf; Date: January 6, 2003, Monday; Text: Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 6 January
 Kathmandu, 5 January: Political parties today responded more or less on their known and expected way to the public speech made by His Majesty King Gyanendra on Friday 3 January in Biratnagar.
 While Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) chief Pashupati Shumsher Rana saw enough scope for a conciliation between the king and the political parties, especially after the Biratnagar speech, leaders of Nepali Congress, CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and People's Front Nepal felt that much depended on how he acted instead of on what he said.
 Speaking during a face-to-face programme organized by the Reporters' Club in the capital, RPP leader Rana said: ""We must not be pessimistic just yet, if we expect to avert the worst."" Rana also said that the speech came at a time when there are specific developments in the backdrop. Speaking in an emotional tone, Rana put up a query as to why the parties were not ready to give benefit of doubt to the king, just as they are giving the benefit of doubt to the rebels. Rana, however, conceded that some unexpected developments had overtaken the nation on 4 October and that the parties must cooperate in a positive manner to avert the crisis which could threaten nationalism.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 6 Jan 03
The king had dismissed an elected government on 4 October last year and assumed all executive powers. Last Friday, in his speech in Biratnagar, the monarch had re-affirmed his commitment to constitutional monarchy and democracy.
 Meanwhile, leaders of other political parties were scathingly critical of the king's speech.
 Nepali Congress (NC) central leader, Narahari Acharya, billed the speech as ""interesting since it was the first speech of a king who wields executive powers"". ""However, positive note lies in the fact that he has not added to the bitterness generated by the 4 October royal move,"" Acharya added sarcastically. ""It would have been better had the king announced possible measures to resolve the crisis dogging the nation."" Acharya further said that although the executive monarch has expressed commitment to democracy, three months after taking over the executive rights, the same however does not gel with the turn of events over the same time period. ""Expressing commitment without any cogent proof is useless,"" he emphatically said. The Nepali Congress leaders also chastised the monarchy for trying to retain political power, even after constitutional monarchy was enshrined by the constitution. ""Yes, monarchy was a power at the end of the (1990) movement for the restoration of democracy, but not after the promulgation of the constitution which has rendered the king as an institution.""
 Similar views were expressed by Homnath Dahal, spokesperson of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), the party which held power when it was dismissed by the monarch on 4 October. But Dahal reiterated his party's demand to restore the ousted government as a way out of the present crisis.
 People's Front Nepal (PFN) leader Amik Sherchan was of the view that the royal address at the civic reception was stale and, as always, the value of same would be decided on the basis of whether political and constitutional course take the desired direction. He also said that the speech contained all the tenets of a garbled speech of an executive authority. ""The need of the time is to speak in clear terms rather than in ambiguous terms,"" he further said. Sherchan also attacked the government for failing to either announce poll dates or hold talks with Maoist rebels.
 CPN-UML leader Modnath Prasrit, billed the speech as ""formulaic"" and said that what matters most is the ultimate motive. He went back to the year 1959 when ""King Mahendra, too, had promised much the similar things but the elected government was dismissed in the following year.""
 The late King Mahendra, the present king's father, had dismissed Nepal's first elected government in December 1960, slightly a year after the first general elections.
 ""The time has come when our relations with monarch ought to be weighed on the constitutional scales,"" Prasrit further said, saying that the monarch would have done well had he announced return of the executive power on the government. He also expressed the view that the king ought to have dropped the idea of competing with political parties in a public place.
 Meanwhile, Minister of Education and Sports Devi Prasad Ojha, representing the government side, assured the political parties of an all-party meeting soon ""which the government thinks can go a long way in garnering due support to resolve the Maoist insurgency"". He said the government was working on the agenda and would soon seek the reaction and suggestion of all the major political parties.

The climber, identified as Michael Turner, 37, a computer consultant from Northampton, was attempting to climb the 7,129-meter (23,280-foot) peak Saturday.
The rope snapped when he reached the West Col point at 6,100 meters (20,000 feet). His body was carried down to the base camp by his team mates, the ministry said.
Turner is the first climber to have died in Nepal during this year's spring mountaineering season. His home town was not immediately known.

Strong winds mixed with snow has made climbing conditions miserable and the much expected window of good weather over the weekend never materialized.
Many climbers who had decided to climb to higher camps over the weekend were forced to return back to the base camp, said Umesh Singh, an official at the Mountaineering Department in Katmandu.
""Our reports say climbers are worried and most of them are boxed at the base camp,"" Singh said.
Some of the teams have abandon their attempt altogether and returned home, Singh said. It was not clear how many of them had backed out of the climb.
Though there were reports of some climbers scaling Everest from the nothern side in China over the weekend, there has not been any success from the more popular route in the south, on the Nepalese side of the mountain.
Ang Tshering, president of Nepal Mountaineering Association, said weather conditions on Everest has been terrible this year compared to previous years.
Weather is the biggest factor in the last part of the climb, where conditions can quickly change and make a huge difference between who gets to the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit.
This last section between the South Col at 8,000 meters (26,240 feet) and the summit is also nicknamed the ""death zone"" for the thin air, slippery slopes and nasty weather.
Some Nepalese Sherpa guides have set up camp at the South Col in the past few days stocking it with food, sleeping bags and oxygen tanks, but they have not been able to fix the ropes on the slopes above that for their clients.
Climbers have had a bad start on the mountain this year.
Two climbers were killed on the mountain earlier this month during an avalanche that swept through the first camp, destroying dozens of tents.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, more than 1,400 climbers have scaled the mountain. About 180 people have died on its unpredictable slopes.

Enterprise of 'great pitch and moment' do not turn awry or fall to pieces if they are undertaken with a view to mitigating human suffering and pain. Sri Sankardeva Nethralaya (SSN) - a high-tech, state-of-the-art eye hospital of North-East India bears testimony to this spectacular success of sustained human effort and boundless human potential. 
Located at Beltola in Guwahati amidst serene natural surroundings, this hospital was conceptualised by a group of good samaritans (the present medical director, Dr Harsha Bhattacharjee being one) who poured heart and soul to transform a long-cherished dream into reality. A non-profit making, non-commercial, charitable institution, SSN is a unit of Sri Sankara Health and Education Foundation Trust instituted by his Holiness of the Kanchi Kamokothi Peetham, Kanchipuram. Since 1994, the year of its inception, the hospital has been offering remarkable ophthalmic services to the whole of North-East and its adjoining states, and simultaneously to the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. In November 1995, SSN was dedicated to the nation by the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao. The rule of conduct adopted by the hospital is 'Work is Worship,' which is the motivator behind the dedicated services of a highly qualified, experienced and competent team of doctors and paramedics.
  Comprehensive eye-examination, treatment of ocular diseases with sophisticated instruments and ultra-modern surgical devices, a solemn sense of responsibility, commitment and strict discipline are some of the hallmarks of SSN. All these are planned and marshalled adroitly, meticulously and with precision by the hospital staff under the tutelage of Dr Harsha Bhattacharjee, who by virtue of his unflinching devotion and commitment has emerged as a veritable role model for many upcoming medicos in this part of the country.
  Service delivery through superspeciality clinics such as Laser, Retina and Vitreous, Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Squint and Orthoptic, Cornea and Glaucoma, Orbit and Ocuplasty, Ocular Prosthetic, Botox and Electro Diagnostic etc is at the very essence of eyecare in SSN. The hospital also undertakes special investigations such as Computerised Static Perimetry, Ocular and Orbital Ultrasonography, Specular Microscopy, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography, Heidelberg Retinal Topography and a host of ultramodern devices which go a long way in providing psychological relief to the patients.
  No less remarkable is the part played by SSN in voluntary welfare services. The eye-bank of the hospital which is open 24 hours is one such instance. Regular awareness programmes on eye-donation are integral to SSN's extension activities, and till date 77 corneal transplants have been successfully carried out.
  Academic activities are conducted by SSN through structured teaching programmes and other schemes for manpower development. The hospital has been accredited by the Union Government as a centre for DNB and in-service training and also as a standard referral institute for the NE states. National and international participation by the faculty in conferences and workshops and seminars for adequate up-to-date training and knowledge is a part of SSN's numerous academic activities. Moreover, programmes in and outside the country for prevention and control of blindness are also regularly attended by the doctors. In pioneering such activities as national and international publication and presentation of scientific papers, the key role has been played by Dr Kasturi Bhattacharjee, the first lady recipient of the FRCS degree in Ophthalmology in North East India. SSN maintains an annual curriculum, CME, post doctoral fellowship and other programmes.
  Led by the spirit of charity, SSN celebrated its foundation day on October 14 and evolved an attitude to life which is humanitarian and has made the Hippocratic Oath itself sacrosanct beyond doubt. The hospital has displayed overwhelming commitment to society, especially to the economically underprivileged and this symbiosis between SSN and society has imparted it with a three dimensionality. Human suffering in respect of traumatic loss of vision has been taken into account seriously and religiously, and in alleviating the pain of the visually impaired, the hospitable family of SSN have distinguished themselves in their outstanding cordiality of manners and enlightened understanding.
  SSN also has become instrumental in establishing and developing human resource in a number of eye hospitals in different locations of the North East and other parts of India in order to render free eye care services through survey, counselling and medical treatment. Behind the phenomenal success of SSN there is that exemplary involvement and belongingness of the hospital staff.

""We are very busy with the injured people now -- there are many people injured here. Definitely some people have died, but I don't know how many,"" a female official at the centre said by phone.
Radio Free Asia, citing unnamed witnesses, also reported that at least two people were killed in Lhasa on Friday.
A Tibetan source said that police had fired live ammunition into a crowd after the demonstrations broke out Friday, the US-based broadcaster said in a dispatch from Nepal, which borders Tibet.
More than 100 Buddhist monks kicked off the protests on Friday morning, which quickly attracted other Tibetans and saw one of the biggest markets in Lhasa as well as cars set ablaze, foreign tourists and rights groups said.

The state-run tourism board attributed the growth to an aggressive international promotional campaign for the land of Mount Everest and a lifting of visa requirements for citizens of other South Asian nations and China.
The tourism-dependent kingdom saw 108,608 foreign visitors between January 1 and April 30, up 48 percent from 73,411 in the same period in 2003, tourism board figures said.
The growth was put at 46 percent for April, a chaotic month that saw nearly daily protests by thousands of opposition supporters demanding King Gyanendra restore elected rule.
""Tourism would have grown even more had the political parties called off their protests and strikes,"" Nepal Tourism Board Director General Tek Bahadur Dangi told AFP.
The opposition closed Kathmandu in a one-day strike April 3, followed by a nationwide shutdown called by Maoist rebels from April 6 to 8. The Maoists have called another strike from May 18 to 20.
The US State Department on April 7 warned US citizens to defer non-essential to Nepal due to reports that American trekkers were detained by Maoists.
The rebels, who want to overthrow the monarchy, control much of the kingdom but have rarely hurt targeted tourism, which sustains 1.25 million jobs in Nepal.
Dangi said there was a particular tourism growth from France. French visitors rose by 61 percent between January and April compared with the corresponding period.
Indians remain the top source of tourists, accounting for more than a quarter of visitors.

""We will continue with this series of military actions,"" rebel leader Prachanda, who uses only one name, said in a statement.
The warning comes after a battle in central Nepal on Saturday described as the fiercest fighting since a cease-fire collapsed last year.
Hundreds of rebels swarmed into Beni, a mountain town 280 kilometers (175 miles) west of Katmandu, the capital, and battled security forces for nearly 12 hours before being chased away by reinforcements.
Army spokesman Col. Deepak Gurung said the army has taken control of the area and is hunting the rebels from both land and air.
The government said its forces killed as many as 500 rebels, but the guerrillas said they lost only about 40 fighters.
Eighteen soldiers and policemen were killed and 18 others were injured, Gurung said. Rebels attacked the town's jail, bombed the district administration office and set fire to the police station.
Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said the rebels were victorious in the battle, capturing many government security officials and taking many modern weapons from them.
There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims.
Fighting between the rebels and government soldiers has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire in August and broke off peace talks. The two sides failed to break an impasse over the rebels' demand for a special elected assembly to draft a new constitution and decide whether Nepal's king should continue as a constitutional monarch.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace the monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

Excerpt from report by Radio Nepal on 8 April
Security forces have foiled simultaneous attacks on different security bases and government offices in Rupandehi and Kapilvastu districts [west Nepal] last night, according to the Defence Ministry. In a statement, the ministry said that the terrorists incurred huge losses in their effort. 
Thousands of terrorists had gathered at Butwal at about 9.00 p.m. [local time] and launched their attack on the Ramnagar Barracks, police training centre, police training centre and the area police station. They also attacked the army battalion based in Taulihawa of Kapilvastu, the district prison, the district police office, the security base at Goru Singhe, the Dhankauli security base and the Guthania security base. 
According to Brig-Gen Nepal Bhusan Chand, director of the Public Relations Directorate of the Royal Nepalese Army, 10 terrorist bodies were later found, six in Taulihawa and four in Butwal. Two SLR and two .303 rifles and ammunition were also seized from the sites. Three security force personnel were killed in the Taulihawa clashes. 
Brig-Gen Chand also said that since the terrorists used the local residents [and their houses] as human shield, private property also incurred damage in the incident. He said a search operation was on to look for the terrorists. Meanwhile our correspondent says that the district administrations of Rupandehi and Kapilvastu have imposed a day curfew in various parts of the districts. [passage omitted]

"2027",20043956,"Title: Where, Oh Where, Is My Cassowary_.rtf; Date: May 30, 2004 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final
ANDREA CRAWFORD is a magazine writer and editor who lives in New York.
MY obsession started last summer at the Australia Zoo in Brisbane. There, with a friend we were visiting, my husband, Michael, and I went first to the most beloved native creatures--kangaroos, koalas, wombats, crocodiles and a Tasmanian devil -- before reaching the cassowary pavilion. Our friend shuddered, pronouncing them ''frightful things.'' I looked at her, puzzled. What, I asked, is a cassowary? 
 Six feet tall and 130 pounds, the cassowary, it turns out, is a bird larger than I am. It can swim, and it can run 30 miles an hour, but -- thank goodness for small evolutionary favors -- cannot fly. It wears a bony helmet like that of a knight in suit of armor and has roamed the rain forest for millions of years. Its cobalt blue head and neck, vivid against its red double wattle, tops a body rounded out with long, black feathers and perched upon strong ostrichlike legs.
  Like many of its Aussie compatriots (sharks, box jellyfish and all 10 of the world's 10 deadliest snakes), the cassowary can kill people. It does this by jumping feet first into the air -- much like the velociraptor in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park -- its five-inch-long middle talon taking aim at the unlucky challenger. This creature I had to see. 
 So I stepped into its pavilion, and there, from the safe, albeit boring, distance of the viewing platform, I saw my first cassowary. Her name was Stomp, and the signs warned not to poke fingers through the fence or get too close. I was smitten.
 It's been said that people travel to find themselves. I, however, would rather find creatures, face to face, in natural habitats -- the rarer, the bigger, the more dangerous, the better. I dream of a trip to Nepal to see the elusive snow leopard, to China to glimpse a giant panda nibbling on bamboo, to Uganda to see a gorilla in the mist. The harder the creatures are to spot, the farther you have to go, the more difficult the journey, the more I yearn to see them.
 Standing on that platform, I suddenly and desperately wanted to see a cassowary in the wild. And I was in luck. Though the government estimates that only 1,200 to 1,500 survive in Australia -- in addition to those also found across the Torres Strait in Papua New Guinea -- they just happen to live in the tropical rain forest of Queensland's far north, where we were headed the very next day.
 So early the following morning, Michael and I left our friends and flew to Cairns, where we rented a car and drove north on the James Cook Highway. Taking our time, we drove along the two-lane coastal road past cane sugar plantations, through one-stoplight towns and across the Daintree River by ferry, before arriving, nearly three hours later, in Cape Tribulation, where Australia's paved roads end. More a scattering of far-flung dwellings than a town in any real sense of the word, Cape Trib, as the locals call it, was named by Cook, whose ship nearly sank within sight of it, having discovered the Great Barrier Reef the hard way. 
 It's the nature of desire that anticipation is often sweeter than the satisfaction of the thing acquired. And adventures, of course, never depend on endings, since the getting there -- and being there -- is all the fun. Is it any less of a quest to make it almost to the top of Mount Everest? Does the person who sits in the woods at Yellowstone waiting to see a wolf really go away disappointed when he sees bison, elk or a marmot instead? Is it that I need to see a gorilla in Uganda -- or that I long to live, for just a few days, like Dian Fossey, pretending that I am something I am not?
 So perhaps it is not just a crazy form of Type-A vacationing when people flock to safaris in Africa bent on sightings of the ''big five.'' It is, rather, that we long for the rhythm of the search, the quietness of the observation, the singular focus of a day spent doing nothing but waiting and watching for a lion, a rhinoceros or a cassowary. The search gives us a common language to share with others, swapping tales of close encounters and creatures sighted. Above all, the search gives us reason to keep searching. 
 And so, for the next three days in the rain forest, the rhythm of my moments turned on seeing a cassowary in the wild. It was a rewarding safari. We embarked on a river cruise and saw some massive, lethargic saltwater crocodiles, but no cassowaries. We hiked in the forest, where we were startled by numerous bush turkeys, but never a human-sized prehistoric bird.
 We took to the open sea in a kayak, and, when I could steal a glance away from the onslaught of waves, trained an eye on the mangroves lining the beach, should a cassowary be wandering there. 
 Back at the inn, our host showed us just-developed photos of a cassowary that had wandered into the yard the week before we arrived. So we sat for hours on our porch. An unread book lay in my lap, my gaze fixed on the forest as I a"

    With 160 exhibits and more than 400 pictures, the exhibition,  held in two halls of the Cultural Palace for Nationalities in  downtown Beijing, consisted of two parts: the ""History of Tibet  and Feudal Serfdom in Old Tibet"" and ""New Tibet Changing With Each  Passing Day."" 
    For 75-year-old Zhang, it was his second trip to the show,  which opened  on April 30 and was expected to run through late  July. 
    On his previous visit, the local man took a ""careful"" and  ""thorough"" view of the displays, but the facts and figures had  faded from his memory on his return. 
    ""This time, I brought a notebook with me,"" he said, while  jotting down facts and figures that showed Tibet was a part of  Chinese territory since the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). 
    Even with a hearing aid, Zhang had to get closer to others to  listen clearly, but this did not stop him from making a lengthy  tour he considered very ""knowledge intensive."" 
    ""I was a soldier in 1951 when the 'Seventeen-Article Agreement'  was signed (between the central government and the local  government of Tibet for the peaceful liberation of the now  autonomous region), and these all proved Tibet has always been a  part of China,"" he said. 
    ""Life in today's Tibet is way better than in the past. Some of  the Western media's recent coverage on Tibet is groundless,"" he  added. 
    In another hall titled ""New Tibet Changing With Each Passing  Day,"" Tang Yongqiang was discussing something with his mother. The  high-school student from the neighbouring Hebei Province had just  finished his college entrance examination earlier this month. 
    ""The exhibition is well worth the time. It is so vivid that I  feel as if I was a witness,"" the youngster said. 
    He left a note in the visitor's book reading "" May Tibet become  more prosperous together with the big family of China, and stop  those secessionist activities from sabotaging people's lives."" 
    The youngster was not the only one to leave a note. 
    Since its opening on April 30, the exhibition has hosted over  100,000 visitors. Hundreds of them, both Chinese and foreigners,  had left notes on Tibet and the exhibition, said Han Xinbo, the  museum office director. 
    Organized visits of students, army officers and government  staff accounted for nearly half the total, he said. 
    As reporters leafed through the book, the messages were  unanimously positive. 
    ""A wonderful insight into Tibet. This helps outsiders form a  correct view. I really enjoyed the exhibition,"" wrote Ken Mclnnes  of Sydney, Australia. 
    Devendra Dhuagaua from Nepal's NTV wrote ""Tibet has been  transformed from rags to riches and the Chinese government  deserves all praise for the positive changes brought to the people  of Tibet."" 
    Only one visitor named Nick Coti from Alaska, USA, put forward  a suggestion. He asked the museum authorities to offer English  guides and add English captions for the video shown upstairs. 
    In a room upstairs, dozens of viewers, including one foreigner,  were watching a video on Tibetan history. Even during lunchtime,  most of the seats were taken. 
    Watching the footage of the Dalai Lama's engagement in the  1950s with China's top leaders Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier  Zhou Enlai was very fresh and informative, said one visitor. 
    In one of the scenes, the Dalai Lama was making a passionate  speech at the First Session of the First National People's  Congress held in Beijing in September 1954. 
    Documentary-like pictures and film clips also showed tools used  by serf owners to torture people in Tibet before the 1951  liberation. 
    Eye-gouging tools, an image of dismembered arms and human skin  formed a sharp contrast with the hall downstairs, where vivid  pictures of modern Tibet were displayed. 
    ""Thousands of years of serfdom in Tibet made the kind people  there suffer,"" wrote visitor Xiao Wenda. ""After the liberation,  those people have started their lives anew with goodness and  blessings.""

Maoist rebels declared a cease-fire in April this year and agreed a landmark truce with the government that will see them lay down their weapons and enter mainstream politics.
""These agreements are a hopeful step forward for the people of Nepal after years of suffering through repression and civil war,"" Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams said in a statement.
But he said the military and rebels needed to prove their commitment to the pursuance of peace and human rights by cooperating with investigations and prosecutions into allegations of ""the atrocities of the past decade.""
Maoist rebels have been blamed for abducting people they suspected were government informants or political opponents, keeping them captive and in many cases executing them during their 10-year insurgency.
At the same time, the military has been blamed for arresting anyone suspected of having links to the rebels and denying them access to family members or lawyers.
""Not a single case of enforced 'disappearance' or extrajudicial execution has been adequately investigated by civilian judicial authorities, much less brought to court,"" the New York-based group said in a statement.
Under the peace agreement, Maoists will be able to hold seats in an interim Parliament that will see the country through to elections next year.

The security forces gunned down at least nine guerrillas including a commander and four women insurgents in the northern remote villages of Dolakha district, some 150 kilometers northeast of Kathmandu, the state-run radio quoted a local security official as saying.
The fighting erupted when a group of armed guerrillas attacked a patrol team of the joint security forces Tuesday evening, and continued till early Wednesday morning, the official said on condition of anonymity.
More than 1,400 anti-government guerrillas have been killed in clashes with the government security forces since the guerrillas unilaterally declared the breakdown of the cease-fire on Aug. 27 last year. The clashes also claimed the lives of about 360 government security personnel so far.
Over 9,000 Nepalese people have lost their lives since the anti- government insurgency broke out in the Himalayan kingdom in early 1996.

Market inspection carried out by the office on Wednesday found cylinders of Bheri Gas, Manakamana, Subidha, Trishul, Koshi, Bheri, Rajdhani, Baba and Sri Krishna Gas Company on the premises of RGI.
The inspection team even found the refilled LPG cylinders of other companies within its plant, which indicates the company was refilling others' cylinders and supplying them in the market.
""This is a clear violation of basic competitive norms,"" said Khagendra Prasad Joshi, chief of the Commerce Office. ""We even found cylinders of RGI containing water, in place of gas, in substantial volume.""
The inspection team sealed the company following such revelation, which goes against laws related to cylinders' standards, consumer rights and competition.
Interestingly, this is not the first time the market inspectors found water in LPG cylinder. ""In a recent case, we had found its LPG cylinder (14.2 kg) of containing as much as five liters of water,"" said Joshi.
Presence of water in the cylinder indicates the company was not conducting necessary cleaning, hydraulic and other tests. This is a serious flaw, as it exposes consumers to grave risks.

On Sunday, Tribune News Service from Chandigarh quoted Karim as having said that prime minister may visit India before the end of the year, maintaining that a lot of homework has to be done before her trip.He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina wants to ""set right all that which has gone wrong in our bilateral relations"", now that ""like-minded governments"" are in power in the two countries.""It is a rare alignment of stars that both India and Bangladesh have like-minded governments. 
It is happening for the first time since 1971 when there was Awami League government in Bangladesh and Congress government in India,"" the diplomat said.He said: ""Period of such amiable star alignment is short. Eleven months of this positive period have already passed. Now we are left with 19 months before mid-term in which we have not only to improve people-to-people contact, eliminate hostilities, end scourge of terrorism by not allowing their territories being used for harbouring terrorists and resolve some of the longstanding problems.""Karim observed that once the process of normalising and strengthening bilateral relations is set in motion, it would help Bangladesh emerge as a stable economic nation.""Sheikh Hasina is conscious of the scourge of terrorism.

"6116",20071998,"Title: Death toll in South Asian floods tops 360.rtf; Date: August 6, 2007 Monday 4:27 PM GMT; Text: Indian air force helicopters swept low over the flooded plains of northern India on Monday, dropping desperately needed aid to some 2 million people marooned by some of the worst flooding to hit the area in 30 years, officials said.
The death toll from the recent flooding surged past 360 even as the waters began to recede across northern India and Bangladesh and aid workers scrambled to prevent an outbreak of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases.
At least 15 people died Monday when heavy currents sank their boat on the flood-swollen Ganges River in Bihar state. Another 30 people were still missing, said Manoj Shrivastav, the Bihar state disaster management secretary.
As the flood waters receded in Bihar, 13 bloated bodies were recovered. Also in Bihar, a teenager fell from his roof and drowned in floodwaters as he tried to catch a food drop.
Helicopters dropped more than 4,300 food packets to desperate residents in Bihar, said Shrivastav.
But authorities have been criticized for being too slow to respond to the crisis with too little aid.
Starving residents were fighting each other over food packets, and in the Darbhanga district hundreds of angry people briefly kidnapped a senior official and the local police chief over the weekend, only releasing them after receiving promises that an aid distribution center would be set up there, said Upendera Sharma, a local government official.
Shrivastav said the monsoon rains were the heaviest to hit the state in 30 years with 880 millimeters (34.5 inches) of rain in 15 days, surpassing the record of more than 600 millimeters (23.6 inches).
In the neighboring Uttar Pradesh state residents complained that aid was insufficient and demanded assistance in rebuilding.
Kedar Nisar on Monday said that he had received only 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of rice from the government in the past week. The 62-year-old man makes a living by rowing a boat, taking people to villages across the river.
""I need money to rebuild my home,"" he said as he prepared to return to his village.
As rains eased doctors and paramedics started supplying medicine to people to prevent diarrhea, skin allergies and other waterborne diseases, said S. K. Gupta, an Indian army officer.
Army doctors treated 235 people suffering from waterborne diseases in makeshift camps near Gorakhpur, a town 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Uttar Pradesh's state capital, Lucknow, said Gupta. ""Our effort is to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic.""
In Bangladesh, the country's military-backed interim leader, Fakhruddin Ahmed, appealed to all Bangladeshis to join army and government efforts to aid the flood-affected people. ""Any natural disaster like floods brings an opportunity for the nation to stand united,"" Ahmed said in a late night address Sunday.
There has been no significant rainfall in the region for three days.
Since the start of the monsoon in June, the government says more than 1,200 people have died in India alone, with scores of others killed in Bangladesh and neighboring Nepal, where floods have hit low-lying southern parts of the country.
The South Asian monsoon season runs from June to September as the rains work their way across the subcontinent, a deluge that spreads floods and landslides across the region and kills many people every year.
So far this year, some 14 million people in India and 5 million in Bangladesh have been displaced by flooding, according to government figures.
However, officials said the flooding was due to an unusual monsoon pattern and not due to global warming.
""These (floods) were coming 50 years ago and today also,"" said B. P. Yadav, the director of government-run Northern Hemisphere Analysis Center. ""There was nothing all of a sudden. It was well anticipated, well expected and well predicted.""
Associated Press reporters Parveen Ahmed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wasbir Hussain in Gauhati, Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow, Ashok Sharma in New Delhi and photographer Rajesh Singh in Uttar Pradesh, India, contributed to this report.

"2929",20045101,"Title: Businesses with surplus of low-wage jobs praise president's call for immigration reform.rtf; Date: January 14, 2004, Wednesday, BC cycle; Text: The tourists who fill the indoor wave pool at the Cape Codder Resort & Spa each summer and vie for tables at the Hearth n' Kettle restaurants won't arrive for months.
But Bill Catania, whose family owns the Massachusetts businesses, has already begun filling out forms to secure 90 temporary workers from Jamaica and Nepal needed to wash dishes and clean rooms once the weather warms.
""There's not enough Americans to take the jobs,"" says Catania, whose company is based in Hyannis, Mass. ""We bring them (foreign temps) in for 10 months and then we have to send them back.""
That challenge - finding and keeping legally employable workers to fill mostly unglamorous lower-wage service jobs - explains broad enthusiasm by Catania and other business owners for an idea that in other quarters sparks heated debate: loosening immigration laws.
President Bush put the idea, shelved after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, back in play recently with a proposal to grant temporary legal status to millions of immigrant workers. The proposal, far from becoming law, would apply to foreign workers already in this country illegally, as well as those who want to come, provided they have a job lined up.
The president's plan, which calls for allowing workers to stay in the country for renewable 3-year periods, is sketchy on specifics. But while the proposal has received wide criticism, including from organized labor, it is warmly received by many businesses, including some that have pushed for relief from Washington.
""The economic need is there,"" said Laura Reiff, a lawyer who co-chairs the Essential Workers Immigration Coalition, a business group that has lobbied for change on the issue. ""I think we've just been handed on a silver platter the chance to get immigration reform in '04.""
EWIC includes a roster of companies and industry groups, from the construction and meatpacking firms to operators of nursing homes and hotels, as well as restaurant chains like Denny's and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store.
Coalition members and others say they already hire large numbers of foreign workers, but complain about time-consuming, expensive procedures to get them, and laws that force them to play policeman and screen out illegals.
Their hiring needs vary greatly. But at a time when many American workers are struggling to find positions, these businesses say their job openings are routinely shunned. They have little choice, businesses say, but to fill many of those jobs with foreigners.
Immigration reform is a matter of necessity, rather than of ideology, they say.
""It's a misnomer to think that these jobs are somehow taken away from Americans,"" said Rick Birkman, owner of Texas Roofing Co. in Austin, Texas, nearly all of whose employees are Mexican-born. ""For a small businessman it just becomes frustrating to get caught in the middle of this argument.""
To prove his point, Birkman points to a photograph on his wall taken a few years after his grandfather founded the roofing business in 1935. It shows company workers, nearly all of them white.
Today, finding American-born workers willing to endure dirty, exhausting, dangerous work on roofs where temperatures can soar to 130 degrees is never easy, he says. The job pays $6.50 to $7 an hour to start with pay rising to $22 an hour after a few years for skilled journeymen or foremen. But the few takers Birkman recruits from local high schools usually quit within weeks, complaining about the heat.
Birkman and other employers say all their workers have presented documents declaring them legal to work. But he acknowledges they may not all be legitimate. The Bush proposal could be a route to what Birkman thinks might be the answer - a training program in Mexico for would-be roofers and other tradesmen, who would then be allowed to come to the U.S. legally with a job already arranged.
The situation is very different but the dynamics are similar for executives at HCR Manor Care, a Toledo, Ohio-based operator of nursing homes and assisted living facilities that struggles to find nurses in the midst of a longstanding national shortage.
The company has bolstered its nursing ranks by bringing in about 25 each quarter from overseas, mostly from the Philippines. But the process takes 18 to 24 months to complete, said Rick Rump, a company spokesman. The company believes the president's proposal would shorten that time to 6 weeks, allowing it to quickly satisfy its hiring needs.
""Who knows how this will turn out, but it's positive what we're hearing,"" Rump said. ""We and every other health care provider is trying to get these people.""
Bill Edwards holds a similar view, based on his experience as general manager of the Hilton Washington. The capital city hotel depends heavily on immigrant labor to fill two sets of jobs - low-wage positions in housekeeping and food service and entry level management jobs running restaurants and lounges. Both job categories attract a relative handful of American applicants"

Police used batons to beat protesters who gathered at three locations in Katmandu while at least half a dozen government motorcycles and cars were torched by the protesters.
Protesting drivers blocked the Prithvi highway, the main route to Katmandu, cutting off most transportation to the capital city.
In parliament, members of the governing alliance also opposed the price hike and blocked proceedings for nearly 30 minutes. They introduced a motion demanding that the government reverse its decision.
""The government must ensure that prices are reduced immediately,"" said Mahendra Pandey, chief whip of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) which is the second largest group in the ruling seven-party alliance.
Anand Prasad Abhungana, chief whip of the Nepali Congress party, supported Pandey's demand.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala pledged to look into their grievances as he returned to the Nepalese capital from his hometown of Biratnagar in east Nepal, where he had been on vacation since last week.
""I will take initiatives to review the prices and deal with the situation,"" Koirala told reporters before boarding a plane to Katmandu.
Koirala is scheduled to hold a Cabinet meeting later Sunday in the Nepalese capital.
Nepal's government raised the prices of gasoline, diesel and kerosene on Saturday to reduce losses for the state-owned monopoly distributor.
State-owned Nepal Oil Corp. owes 16 billion rupees (US$213 million; euro177 million) to the Indian Oil Corp., from which it imports all of Nepal's oil products.
The retail price of gasoline was raised 25 percent to 84.25 rupees (US$1.20; euro1) per liter.
Both diesel and kerosene prices were set at 59 rupees (US$0.80; euro0.66) per liter. Diesel increased by 11 percent while kerosene was hiked by 24 percent.
Nepal Oil Corp. has a monopoly on the import and distribution of oil in Nepal, and the government fixes the retail rate. Most oil products are subsidized, and the government bears the loss.
The higher diesel price, especially, is expected to increase prices for food and other commodities because trucks are the only practical means of transporting them in the landlocked, mountainous Himalayan nation.

The officials blamed the attack late Saturday in the Chitwan district, about 60 kilometers southwest of the capital, on Maoist rebels waging an armed insurgency in the kingdom.
 The soldiers were heading from the district to Kathmandu in an 11-vehicle army convoy when their truck drove over a land mine, the officials said.
 Maoist rebels, waging a rebellion to overthrow the Nepalese monarchy and end multiparty rule, have lately been laying land mines targeting security personnel across the kingdom.

"4515",20066674,"Title: Nepal 's king pledges democracy on anniversary of power grab, as rebels kill 20.rtf; Date: February 1, 2006 Wednesday 2:52 PM GMT; Text: Speaking on the first anniversary of his seizure of power, Nepal's king vowed Wednesday to hold national elections within 15 months and claimed success in fighting back communist rebels despite an attack that killed at least 17 policemen and three soldiers.
Scores of police were reported missing after the overnight rebel assault on a mountainous town in western Nepal, a Royal Nepalese Army spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing military policy.
In Katmandu, security forces blocked a coalition of the seven largest political parties as they tried to hold a rally to press King Gyanendra to bring back democratic rule. Police beat several protesters and arrested nearly 100 others. Authorities also sprayed the demonstrators with water from fire hoses and charged at them with batons.
Hundreds of other dissidents were arrested before the rally, politicians said.
Similar rallies against the king's absolute rule also were planned in other major towns, and security forces throughout the country were on high alert.
King Gyanendra seized control of the government on Feb. 1, 2005, drawing sharp protests from the main political parties and criticism from foreign governments, which have urged him to restore democracy.
He announced in an address marking the anniversary of his takeover that parliamentary elections would be held within 15 months.
""All the positions held by people's representatives will be filled"" by mid-April 2007, Gyanendra said in the speech, which was carried by state-run media.
But the address failed to satisfy Nepal's main political parties, with party leaders saying it signaled to softening of his authoritarian rule and insisting they would press ahead with anti-government protests.
When he seized power, Gyanendra said he was taking action to quell the country's communist rebellion and end corruption. Since 1996, about 12,000 people have died in the rebellion, which aims to replace the monarchy with a socialist state.
Gyanendra insisted Wednesday that security had improved under his rule and that the tide was turning against the rebels, who control large parts of rural Nepal.
""Terrorist activities have narrowed down to just a few sporadic criminal activities,"" he said.
However, hours before he spoke, rebels attacked an army camp, police station, jail and government buildings in the western town of Tansen, killing at least 17 policemen and three soldiers, the army spokesman said.
At least 143 policemen and the chief district officer were also missing in the town, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Katmandu, he said.
Few details of the fighting which continued through Wednesday morning were available because communications in the area were severed and the only road was blocked by felled trees.
Army helicopters were able to land and reinforcements had reached the area, said Gangadutta Awasti, the chief government administration officer in neighboring Rupandehi district.
The main rebel leader, who goes by the name Prachanda, said in a statement e-mailed to news organizations that the guerrillas had also taken several policemen and soldiers captive.
He also said there were rebel casualties, but did not give any details.
The rebels ended a four-month unilateral cease-fire on Jan. 2, and have launched a series of attacks since then.
Nepal has held no elections since 1999 and its parliament was dissolved in 2002. Successive governments were appointed by the king.
Krishna Sitaula of Nepali Congress, the country's largest political party, said he and many other dissidents were in hiding, and that his house had been raided several times ahead of Wednesday's planned rally.
""We have reports that more than 600 pro-democracy activists have been arrested by the police, and they are continuing raids,"" Krishna said.
""The king clearly said he is going to continue his authoritarian rule. It shows there is not going to be any changes immediately,"" said Mahesh Acharya of Nepali Congress.
Earlier, the United States renewed its calls for the king to discuss a return to democracy with the country's political parties, saying authoritarian rule had been unsuccessful.
Palace rule has ""only made the security situation more precarious, emboldened the Maoist insurgents and widened the division between the country's political parties,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said overnight in Washington.

"7741",20117424,"Title: Between prejudice & discrimination.rtf; Date: November 10, 2011 Thursday; Text: Nepal, Nov. 10 -- In a country fraught with caste-ism, class-ism as well as the global syndromes of sexism and racism, at a time when discrimination is illegal and reverse discrimination excused, defending the two may slide somewhere between silly and stupid. But allow me to explain.
In seventh grade World Geography class, we were being molded into non-discriminating souls (as impossible as that truly is). As our teacher pulled out flashcards with a profession written on one end, we were supposed to throw connecting word. ""Scientist"" was followed by crazy, old man, and white coat, ""Homemaker"" by mother, frumpy, and messy hair, and ""Professor"" was followed by tweed coat, briefcase, and nerdy man.
As you can imagine, our teacher, in an effort to prove our biases were simply that - biases, flipped over the cards to show us a young woman holding beakers in a lab, a middle-aged man setting the dinner table, and an old woman lecturing in a hall. The simple exercise was to demonstrate to us middle school-ers that the world may not be as movies and mass media portray various foreign people groups to be.
I wish I could tell you I learned my lesson but psychology class later on in 11th grade taught me something perhaps more useful. In considering how mob mentality worked, the conversation steered toward what kind of people make mobs. Because the class was too charged in attempting to pinpoint ""who"" makes mobs, our teacher set aside her lesson plan for the day and facilitated one of my school days' most enlightening discussions.
Unfortunately, I cannot remember who said what but I do vividly recall the lesson from that day: That we gauge another being based on our prejudices and then choose to act (or as the case may be, react) based on such prejudice of what we see and what we are presented with - this more than not is determined by peoples' sex, age, gender, affluence, profession and so on and so forth. Furthermore, we agreed that prejudices helps us assume and presume (sometimes very wrongly) what the other person we are to engage with may value, understand, have experienced or may do. Our action is determined by our impression of what the other may be.
For instance, when we exchange Rs 17 or small talk with the khalashi bhai, we hardly expect them to have been raised in a non-lower socio-economic setting, to have attended school or to have many other opportunities.
All of that, of course, is just our prejudice. Prejudice on its own could then perhaps be considered harmless. It is, according to the Oxford Dictionary, only ""preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience"". Where this becomes dangerous is when such a preconceived opinion is acted upon and then refused to be challenged.
Discrimination, which is our action based on our idea, can be innocent and honest, but we must always be willing to change our opinion of peoples once we are more learned of them.
Discrimination is ""the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things"". The difference is subtle, but it is weighty. While prejudice is simply a notion, discrimination is when that notion rightly or wrongly shapes our (re)action.
I would even go so far as to say the action itself is not always wrong. You don't pick a conversation about the US troops pulling out of Iraq or about Quantum Physics with your khalashi bhai. Usually, the conversation we get pulled into is about bandas, rising bus fares or traffic. I admit I have a prejudice about the bhais being uneducated and perhaps even uninterested in current affairs and I chose to act on them by steering conversation clear of such topics.
I'll defend my act of discrimination as it's an honest attempt to have a civil conversation about mundane topics because I am cramped in a small micro with them for a good 30 minutes and the silence is otherwise deafening.
Where I would have to retract is to box them in as uneducated and uninterested in global affairs. If they asked me about the recent referendum in Greece or about Pythogeroan theorem, I admit I would be surprised but I would not dare claim such topic was beyond them. I have good reason to as well, as life has taught all of us willing to learn that people will surprise you.
After all, what is this shift in women heading states and men becoming homemakers proving to us? That a woman may lead and a man may have a nurturing side to him too. You know the man in the suit may be unemployed and the woman flapping about in chappals may be a lecturer, but our prejudice would have us fooled.
When discrimination cannot be defended though is when the action, based on our opinion of them alone, is frozen. To deny a human being more than what is stereotypical of whatever group they have been slotted into is simply moronic. Furthermore, ill-treatment (so, discriminating against a certain group) based on physical characteristics that are God-given rather than man-made is simply idiotic.
To think a woman is less "
"4617",20061661,"Title: India steps up border vigil as Nepal braces for more violence.rtf; Date: April 19, 2006 Wednesday 3:52 PM  EST; Text: Sonoli (UP), April 19 -- Security has been tightened up along the Indian side of the India-Nepal border in the wake of increased incidents of violence in Nepal.
  The states sharing borders with Nepal have alerted the check posts to keep a strict vigil along the border. The Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) or paramilitary border guards have been checking every vehicle at the Sonali border point in Uttar Pradesh. 
  Seema Suraksha Bal Commanding Officer Vijay Kumar said that they were keeping a close watch on the ongoing situations in Nepal.
  ""Keeping in mind the situation in Nepal, which have been receiving from headquarters, we have increased vigil at the border. Checking has been increased. Patrolling is on. We are keeping a strict eye on the situation,"" Vijay Kumar said.
  Nepal is observing 14th day of a general strike called by the seven-party political alliance opposing King Gyanendra's rule in the Himalayan Kingdom. The Maoists are backing the strike, which started on April 6. 
  On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters gathered in various parts of the capital, Kathmandu, despite bad weather and attempted to start a procession. However, police foiled their attempt without hurting anyone.
  Although the powerful army remains loyal to the king, protests are spreading from the street to the civil service. Nepalese Police arrested at least 25 government officials for demonstrating against King Gyanendra inside the Home Ministry yesterday. 
  Those detained included the private secretary to Home Minister Kamal Thapa. 
  The Home Ministry controls the kingdom's police who have been deployed in large numbers to counter growing anti-monarchy protests in recent days. It is the first time officials have joined the opposition protests against the king. 
  Outside the capital, police fired rubber bullets to break up protests in two towns, injuring about a dozen, witnesses said.
  Nepal's political parties have called for mass rallies, and vowed to bring out hundreds of thousands of people on the street on Thursday. 
  The king earlier this week held talks with the United States, Chinese and Indian ambassadors and indicated that he could meet some of the protesters' demands. The United States and India have been repeatedly calling for the restoration of democracy in the country. 
  India fears that the Nepal's Maoist rebels may create trouble with the help of Indian Maoists active in the Indo-Nepal border areas. 
  King Gyanendra sacked the government and assumed full power in February last year, vowing to crush a decade-old Maoist revolt in the country. 
  He, however, has offered to hold elections by April next year, but the politicians and the activists have demanded immediate transfer of power to an all-party government.

Kathmandu, 11 July: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Population Amik Serchan has said that formation of the interim government is more important than trying to prolong the life of the present government. He said that all the obstacles on the part of forming an interim government should be removed. He was speaking at the annual function of a school in the capital.
Nobody should try to back away from the agreement reached between the government and the Maoists. If that happens, the peace talks will fail, Serchan said.

Protesters burned tyres and torched at least three motorcycles at the close of the two-day strike, which opposition parties called even though the pro-royal prime minister last week met their demands to resign.
In the countryside, a Maoist insurgency surged on with 34 people killed in fierce fighting over two days, according to police.
Traffic was off the streets of Kathmandu and shops were closed, with supporters of the opposition, which is not affiliated with the Maoists, putting locks on the doors of 32 municipal offices to enforce the strike, witnesses said.
Angry youth smeared soot on the face of one municipal ward chief who showed up for work, Haribol Nakarmi, who was ushered away to safety by riot police, opposition activist Bhairav Rawal said.
After scattered rallies in the morning, some 20,000 protesters converged near the royal palace where they held banners of leftist parties and shouted slogans demanding the king to restore democracy.
Speakers pledged the often fractious opposition would put up a united front in negotiations with the palace to name the replacement for Surya Bahadur Thapa, the king's handpicked premier who quit Friday after more than a month of street protests.
""Whatever efforts the regressive forces may try, the unity among the five opposition parties will not break,"" Sushil Koirala, general secretary of the Nepali Congress party, told the rally near Narayanhiti Palace.
The main opposition leaders have refused to deal individually with the king, demanding he negotiate with all the parties' chiefs at once.
The king, however, met Tuesday with Sher Bahadur Deuba, the prime minister he fired in 2002 when he suspended elected rule.
Deuba said he asked for his former job back but also urged the king to negotiate with the parties spearheading the protests.
The king dismissed Deuba arguing that elected leaders were ""incompetent"" at solving Nepal's myriad problems, particularly a Maoist insurgency which has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.

Speaking at the inauguration of Training on Post Clearance Audit to the chives of different customs offices, director general at the department Tanka Mani Sharma said that the audit will help make traders more responsible.
Effective implementation of Post Clearance Audit will help scrutinise all consignments and supporting documents, Sharma said, adding that Post Clearance Audit helps maintain international standard in transactions through customs points.
Post Clearance Audit is a method of controlling economic operators through examination of their accounts and records. It should also be seen as trade facilitation, if it is used to simplify clearance procedures, he informed.
The government had established Post Clearance Audit Office in 2009 with the purpose of verifying the accuracy and authenticity of declarations and covers the control of traders' commercial data, business systems, records, books.
The Post Clearance Audit Office is mulling to introduce the system of auditing of whole firms over a certain period of time instead of transaction-based audit, chief at the office Hari Sharan Pudasaini said. ""International Monetary Fund (IMF) and USAID are providing technical assistance to the office to enhance its capacity,"" he added. The existing Customs Act states that the Post Clearance Audit Office can audit firms until four years after the date of clearance of goods, if found suspected transactions.
The Director General or Customs Officer may audit the importer's books relating to the purchase, import or sale of goods, records, books of accounts or similar other documents, bank records, computer system and all records related to his or her business to ascertain whether the goods cleared by the customs are same as declared by an importer or confirm to the declaration made by the importer or not, the Act states.
Traders will be subject to fine, if claimed import is found different from declaration or are inconsistent with declaration or transaction value or quantity of goods has been declared less and by virtue there of lesser duty has been recovered.

At a meeting held at the head office of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxists-Leninists), the Nepali Congress strongly argued that it was not appropriate to make a joint recommendation of a candidate for prime minister as called by the king while the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxists-Leninists) proposed to make a recommendation to the king so as not to miss out the opportunity.
 The Nepali Congress stood by its stance not to make recommendations arguing that the king's call for a joint recommendation had ill intentions. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxists-Leninists) argued that even though it was unconstitutional for the king to attach conditions for them to make a recommendation, it would be good to make a joint recommendation of a candidate to the king. Following heated debate between the two major political parties, the president of the Nepali Congress stormed out of the meeting before it concluded.
 The meeting which went on for four hours did not reach a conclusion on a joint nomination for prime minister; however the five parties claimed that their agreement in the joint agitation against regression would not be broken. Meanwhile, addresses by senior leaders of the five parties at a scheduled mass meeting in the capital tomorrow to discuss resolving the country's political crisis have been put on hold.

"1458",20044831,"Title: Tens of thousands rally for peace in insurgency-racked Nepal.rtf; Date: December 27, 2004 Monday 2:47 PM GMT; Text: Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through Nepal's capital Kathmandu Monday to call for an end to an increasingly bloody conflict between Maoist rebels and security forces.
Organisers said some 150,000 students, human rights activists and other supporters took part in the peace march in the ancient capital, halting traffic. Police declined to comment on the numbers.
The impoverished Himalayan kingdom is in the grips of a nearly nine-year revolt by the Maoists who are seeking the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy and the establishment of a communist republic.
The demonstration was organised by the pro-left All Nepal National Free Students Union and the People's Solidarity for Peace Committee.
""This is the largest-ever peace rally of its kind held to appeal to both the Maoist rebels and the government to end the conflict and sit down at the peace negotiation table,"" said Shree Krishna Joshi, one of the rally organisers.
Students paraded through the streets, shouting ""We want pens not guns"".
Human rights groups say the Maoists are forcibly drafting the students to take part in the revolt.
The rally was held as a crippling Maoist-called transport blockade of the Kathmandu valley entered its fifth day. The blockade is aimed at protesting the disappearance of rebel activists.
Nepal's National Human Rights Commission said recently it had recorded over 1,400 cases of people disappearing from both sides in the conflict.
Protesters appealed to the Maoists to end the blockade which has disrupted food and fuel supplies to the valley where some 1.5 million people live.
Violence has escalated ahead of a January 13 deadline set by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for the Maoists to resume peace talks.
Deuba has said he will go ahead with long postponed national elections in April if the rebels do not return to the negotiating table.
The Maoists, however, say they will only take part in talks under international auspices that focus on their call for an assembly to draw up a new constitution.
The government has rejected the demand for international mediation.

"7150",2008338,"Title: WINDS OF CHANGE IN NEPAL.rtf; Date: May 1, 2008 Thursday 1:51 AM  EST; Text: Guwahati, May 1 -- New power equations have developed in Nepal as a result of the recent Constituent Assembly elections. The erstwhile revisionists have entered the corridors of power, driven by a promise of change: to make the monarchy history and build a democratic republic.
  The people of Nepal have spoken with their votes. The Communist Party of Nepal (the Maoists) has finally become mainstream in Nepali politics with an unprecedented mandate, with their leader Prachanda, declaring that he himself would lead the new government of the republic of Nepal. This in fact, has caught much of the international community including India unawares.
  Till recently, the Indian establishment had felt that the Maoists would win a significant number of seats but it had not expected them to emerge as the largest political group. The US assessment too seemed to be on similar lines. No wonder, the Bush administration made no attempt to get the Maoists off the State Department's list of ""terrorist groups"". But steadily, India has woken up to the reality and the statements coming from New Delhi seem to be geared towards the formulation of a new strategy to make sense of the winds of change in Nepal.
  Though caught unprepared by the surge of the Maoists in Nepal, there is no way out but for India to gather its thoughts to build a coherent response to the emerging developments taking place within its neighbour, that forms an inevitable part of its strategic and its larger foreign policy calculations.
  No doubt, New Delhi would be assured by the fact that a government if formed has to be a coalition, as per the conditions of the interim constitution. The Maoist leader Prachanda has been publicly appreciative of a coalition, but diplomatic sources point at radical voices in the party who are suspicious of a coalition government.
  The Union government's view has centred on pronouncing the importance of the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), even though as minor partners. New Delhi has tried to put forward the view that it is a natural decision which even the Maoists, would have taken if the situation had been reversed.
  Apart from drafting a new constitution, the new government's main task would be to work on the country's economic development, which has taken a backseat as politics has held sway. Nepali economy is in shambles: fuel shortages routinely paralyse the country, while more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line. The country's pitiful growth rate hovers barely over two per cent as unprecedented numbers of Nepalese are quitting the Country for jobs in the Gulf, India and Southeast Asia. An estimated 10,000 women who leave each year, end up as sex workers in Indian brothels, and the numbers are now skyrocketing.
  The uplifting of Nepali economy is an area where India believes it can make the most difference, something on which it feels even the Maoists understands India's importance With the unprecedented mandate achieved by a communist party in Nepal, the China factor would be quite prominent in the minds of the Indian establishment. China will be India's natural competitor for the new government's heart and mind. But for the time being, Beijing is being given a profuse sweating by Tibetan forces around the world, and its immediate interest will be in the new government's intentions of keeping the Tibetans in Nepal Under control before the Olympics. But, it is no time to relax and take China for granted. It would be naive to believe that China would be kept in a limbo by the Tibetan activism and turn a blind eye to the developments in Nepal.
  The election results are significant not just for Nepal, but also for the whole of South Asia. It has been a highly observed election, both nationally and internationally, in which nearly 65 per cent of the nation's voting population had exercised its franchise. The electoral process has largely succeeded, amidst international apprehensions, and reports of at least 60 being, killed in the run-up to the elections.
  The victory of the Maoists, who want Nepal to be a republic, has practically sealed the fate of the discredited monarchy in Kathmandu. In theory, the formation of the 601-member Constituent Assembly means the ultimate abolition of the monarchy. Moreover, fresh reports say that Prachanda is planning to meet King Gyanendra and pressure him to abdicate before the final abolition. But many suspect that the institution, which has defined the Nepalese State for centuries, will simply vanish.
  It is definite that New Delhi's relations with Kathmandu will change but as things appear now, it would hopefully not change for the worse. The Maoists have sounded appreciative of India's implicit stand on their struggle of a republic in Nepal. Prachanda has said that his country would maintain ""equal distance"" from its two giant neighbours India and China but that good relations with New Delhi were """

 Eighteen police officers and 11 army soldiers were killed in the attack in Bhojpur, about 200 kilometers east of the capital, and over a dozen other security personnel were injured.
The rebels also suffered heavy losses when a night-vision helicopter pounded them in the fighting, according to the army. Dozens of rebels were killed and at least 10 bodies of the insurgents have been recovered so far, the army said.
 Hundreds of rebels launched the attack in the center of the town by hurling bombs and opening fire at government office buildings around 9:30 p.m. Fighting lasted until the early hours of Wednesday.
 The office of the local chief government official, a local bank building and a telecom tower were destroyed.
 The rebels killed most of the security personnel guarding the telecom tower.
 The injured security personnel were airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment, the government said, adding further details of the losses were not immediately known.
 The attack in Bhojpur is the largest carried out by the rebels since the breakdown of a cease-fire and peace talks with the government last August.
 The rebels of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) are waging an armed rebellion to topple the monarchy and set up a republican state in Nepal.
 More than 10,000 Nepalese have been killed since the outbreak of the insurgency in February in 1996, according to government figures.

 Kathmandu: The government's decision to regulate education at religious schools like Islamic madarasahs [religious seminaries] and Buddhist monasteries have been welcomed by the Muslim and Buddhist communities but they are also wary of the goals and procedures of the policy.
 The communities say that the ""goal of the new policy must not be tarnished"".

Currently, Islamic education is taught in about 2,000 madrasahs in the country, while Buddhist education is imparted in Buddhist monasteries equipped with proper physical infrastructure and those located in urban areas, out of a total of 1,460 registered monasteries.
 Muslim intellectual Dr Imran Ansari welcomes the government's decision but warned, ""It must not have an ulterior motive. It must not have been made in order to control Islam at the behest of foreigners."" [passage omitted]

Text of report by UN regional information network IRIN on 10 November
Kinshasa, 10 November: Reports that Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) fighters have returned to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have not yet been substantiated, according to the military spokesman for the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC).
""For the moment, there is no tangible evidence to confirm an LRA presence,"" Lt-Col Thierry Provendier, the MONUC military spokesman, said on Wednesday [9 November].
His statement was based on an account by a team of UN observers and troops investigating the reported presence of LRA rebels in and around the Garamba National Park, in northeastern Congo where it borders Sudan, since 2 November.
LRA deputy leader Vincent Otti and some 400 rebel fighters sought refuge in the area in September, after fleeing Ugandan troops hunting them in southern Sudan.
On 29 September, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni threatened to invade eastern Congo if the authorities failed to expel the LRA.
The Congolese army declared on 7 October that all LRA rebels had left, after thousands of government troops entered the area with MONUC's logistical support.
On Saturday [5 November], however, the Ugandan army said the LRA had again entered the Congo. The Ugandan Army northern base overall intelligence coordinator, Col Charles Otema Awany, also told the Kampala government daily newspaper, the New Vision, that LRA leader Joseph Kony was amongst the rebels.
According to Provendier, the UN observers were supported by 144 Nepalese UN troops who together with Congolese soldiers searched for the LRA northeast of the town of Aba to the villages of Ima and Misa, as well as Mamuru and Banga on the Sudanese border. Both sets of troops said they did not find any sign of the LRA.

""The good news is they agreed to set up a focal point at the Ministry of Social Welfare to engage directly with UNICEF,"" Radhika Coomaraswamy told reporters at Yangon airport before leaving the country.
Coomaraswamy arrived in Myanmar on Monday to act on the Security Council resolution 1612 adopted in July 2005 that established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to try to enforce compliance among armed groups using children.
On Wednesday, she met with Myanmar acting Prime Minister Lt. Gen. Thein Sein, who is also chairman of the Committee for Prevention of Recruitment of Minors for Military Service, and other senior officials in the country's capital Naypyitaw, about 400 kilometers north of Yangon, and explained the framework of the 2005 Security Council resolution, according to a U.N. news center report published Friday.
The government, after the meeting, agreed to name a high-level official from the Southeast Asian nation to liaise with the U.N. Country Team and the U.N. Children's Fund on all matters pertaining to children and armed conflict, the report added.
According to the U.N. secretary general's latest report on the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts, released in October 2006, there were reliable reports of continued forcible recruitment of children in Myanmar for the government forces and for nongovernment armed groups.
A child soldier is defined as any person under 18 who is part of any kind armed group in any capacity -- including combatants, cooks, porters, messengers and others accompanying such groups.
Latest estimates suggest that more than 250,000 children are currently serving as child soldiers around the world, in countries such as Colombia, Somalia, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the Ivory Coast, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, Uganda and the Philippines.

HIGH CRIMES 
  The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed. 
  By Michael Kodas.

  MOUNTAIN MADNESS 
  Scott Fischer, Mount Everest and a Life Lived on High. 
  By Robert Birkby. 
  Illustrated. 342 pp. Citadel Press/Kensington Publishing. $24.95. 
  In 2003, on the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Mount Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary, who died in January, returned to the mountain. He looked around at base camp's satellite dishes, electric generators and free-flowing booze, and despaired. ''Just sitting around in a big base camp, knocking back cans of beer, I don't particularly regard as mountaineering,'' he said.
  How did we get from Hillary's noble ascent to a Himalayan version of Burning Man? Two new books lend some insight. One is a biography of a man who helped open the era of guided climbing on Everest; the other offers a portrait of the mountain as a magnet for selfishness and bad behavior. 
  Scott Fischer is best known as the charismatic American guide who died on Everest in 1996, a disaster told in Jon Krakauer's ''Into Thin Air.'' To his friend Robert Birkby, for Fischer to be remembered for that tragedy alone is an unjust summation of an extraordinary life. ''Mountain Madness'' is a personal, uncritical biography that rounds out the portrait of Fischer sketched in Krakauer's best seller.
  An athletic kid from New Jersey, Fischer was known as a bold risk taker -- they called him ''the fallingest man in climbing'' -- until an old-school cragger taught him the Zen of controlled ascent. From then on, Fischer spoke of mountains as a stage on which to practice a mastery of motion. Physical mastery wasn't uncommon among Fischer's peers; what set him apart was his personal magnetism and infectious enthusiasm. The man was a walking Red Bull-and-vodka cocktail. ''You're either cruisin' or you're bummin,''' he often said. ''Cruising's a lot more fun, so you might as well cruise.'' 
  Fischer created his adventure travel company, Mountain Madness, as a way to make a living while ''cruising.'' He climbed some of the world's toughest mountains, sometimes with clients and sometimes without, but the big prize -- Everest -- eluded him until his third try in 1994. Fischer and a handful of others stood at the center of the mountain's transformation from an elite mountaineering arena into an amateur's deadly challenge. In 1989, some of today's best-known Everest climbers were still struggling to post their first summit. Only two years later they were guiding clients up the South Col. In late 1995, a little over a year after his own first summit, Fischer was telling prospective clients, ''We've got the Big E wired.'' 
  Fischer didn't have it wired, of course, and the following spring Everest took his life. His death seemed to put an exclamation mark on the closing of an era. In 1996 Fischer and his guiding colleagues invited the world to follow them via satellite phone and Internet updates -- and the floodgates opened. ''The privacy of an expedition,'' Birkby writes of that infamous climbing season, ''so long one of its basic aspects, was about to disappear.''
  Privacy was the least of the losses. In the years after Fischer's death, camaraderie and common decency all but disappeared too. According to Michael Kodas, the author of ''High Crimes,'' base camp today is a lawless village, complete with thievery, extortion, prostitution and occasional violence. In 1996, 98 climbers made it to the top. In 2007, more than 500 summited. ''Along with that rush of visitors,'' Kodas writes, ''has come a new breed of parasitic and predatory adventurer.'' It's gotten so bad that some expeditions hire Sherpas to stand guard against burglars. 
  Kodas, a reporter for The Hartford Courant, knows the situation firsthand, having tried to climb Everest in 2004 and 2006. (He was turned back by bad weather and poor health.) ''High Crimes'' looks at the mountain through the eyes of a fascinated and appalled climber. Kodas weaves accounts of his own hilariously awful adventures with the not-so-funny story of Nils Antezana, a 69-year-old American doctor who fell victim to the underhanded practices now common on the mountain. (Both attempted Everest in 2004 but never met. Kodas climbed the mountain's north side, from Tibet; Antezana took the southern route, from Nepal.) 
  Like too many of today's Everest climbers, Antezana wasn't a mountaineer. He was a man with a dream: to conquer the world's highest peak. To reach that goal, he hired an Argentine guide named Gustavo Lisi. In climbing circles, Lisi was known as a scoundrel who once stole a dying climber's Everest summit photo and claimed it as his own. Antezana was unaware of Lisi's history because he hadn't spoken with any climbers who could have clued him in. He knew only that Lisi's Web site claimed -- falsely "

 Kathmandu, 17 July: Police, in a classic case of high-handedness, has vandalized the control rooms of six cable TV networks Friday night 16 July , disrupting transmission to over 12,000 households in the capital. Subisu Cable Television Network, Blue Himalayan Cable TV Network, Cable TV Network of Nepal, Sky Cable TV Network, and High Himalayan Cable TV Networks in Maitidevi and Dallu have claimed collective damages worth 9m rupees approx 125,000 US dollars as a result of the raids that took place at around 8 p.m. local time Friday.
 While Subisu's TV cable is still operational, the rest of the network cable connections will require over five days of repair works to become functional again. There are 16 cable TV networks operating in the capital.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 18 Jul 04
According to owners of the networks the police teams, equipped with cutting tools, broke into control rooms without search warrants, randomly cut network wires and left with transmission boxes. All the transmission boxes were returned on Sunday morning, without explanation to the network owners why the entire step was taken.
 While police have accused the networks of engaging in irregularities including tax evasion, the cable network owners have accused police of high-handedness and have questioned the basis on which police undertook the raids and vandalized their offices.
 ""Even if we were involved in any irregularity, there is a proper channel to take action, and that is through the Ministry of Information or Revenue Investigation Department,"" argued Deepak Sainju, managing director of Sky Cable TV.
 Radheshyam Lekali, manager of the Cable Association, demanded inquiry into the vandalism as well as compensation for the losses suffered by the cable TV operators.
 The owners also accused police of bringing in professional TV networkers from rival cable operators to cause maximum damage on their infrastructure.
 Superintendent of Police SP Deepak Ranjit, chief of district police office, Hanumandhoka, who spearheaded the raids, said that the step was taken after police received written complaint from Cable TV Network Association of Nepal. However, the association has denied having filed any such complaint.
 ""We received a written complaint that the six cable TV networks were involved in tax fraud, misuse of communication infrastructure of Nepal Telecom Authority, distribution of more cable lines than permitted and import of TV networking equipment by evading customs clearance,"" he said. Ranjit further defended the raids by stating that the whole effort was aimed at bringing to the state coffers over 270m rupees that the six cable networks have evaded in taxes.
 Upon being asked whether police has the authority to raid cable networks without prior warnings from relevant authorities, SP Ranjit said that someone had to take the step. ""Now it is up to the Ministry of Information and Revenues Investigation Department to take further action,"" he said.
 Deep Basnet, director-general of Revenues Investigation Department, denied any knowledge of the incident. ""I don't know how all this happened. We made no request to the police to take such action,"" said Basnet.

"719",20031866,"Title: India 's foreign minister urges Pakistani businessmen to work toward a South Asian union.rtf; Date: July 7, 2003 Monday; Text: India's foreign minister on Monday suggested forming a South Asian union to promote economic and political cooperation in the region, as business leaders from rivals India and Pakistan considered ways to step up trade.
""If other regions could achieve this kind of union despite political, social and economic differences, there is no reason why we should deprive our people of this opportunity,"" External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said.
""We are ready to start discussion on this (union) from tomorrow, if other countries are also ready for this,"" he said.
Sinha has made similar offers before, with a view to a South Asian union that would aim not only at free trade but easier travel and closer political cooperation between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives.
The South Asian nations have, however, not been able to even work out a free trade treaty because of hostile relations between India and Pakistan. The process of setting up of South Asia Free Trade Area, which was to start by 2000, has not yet begun.
Sinha's offer came at a business conference attended by Indians and more than 100 Pakistanis who said they were optimistic about the latest peace efforts by the two countries to end their five-decade dispute over Kashmir - the Himalayan region both claim in its entirety.
Pakistani delegates said, however, that they would first like to see the Indian government ease visa rules and restore transport and air services. The Pakistani businessmen also want both governments to remove several barriers to trade of goods and services.
""If we are really interested in promoting trade and economic cooperation within South Asia, particularly between India and Pakistan, we will have to work to strengthen and expand existing communication links,"" said Aziz Ahmad Khan, who was recently appointed Pakistan's ambassador to India.
""As of today, the situation is not very encouraging,"" Khan said, adding, ""The majority of the businessmen sitting in this room have traveled via Dubai, spending 18 to 30 hours in transit to attend this conference.""
India and Pakistan cut diplomatic and travel links after a December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based Islamic guerrilla groups and Pakistan's intelligence service. Islamabad denied involvement.
The two governments recently announced they would restore their ambassadors, and Pakistan's envoy has taken up his post.
The bus service linking New Delhi with the western Pakistani city of Lahore is to resume Friday. Officials from both sides said they hope air and rail services will be soon restored.
Participants at the two-day conference said the latest peace process was likely to succeed, paving the way for increased economic and business exchanges between the two countries where some 1.2 billion people live.
""We feel, this time it is going to be different. There will not be a rollback in the peace process, because of its backing from international leaders â¦ or international pressure,"" said Habib Ullah, a Pakistani textile manufacturer.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 10 October
[Presenter] The follow-up of the summit meeting between the government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which started on Sunday [8 October], ended inconclusively today, as well. However, the leaders of the seven-party alliance and the Maoist leadership agreed tentatively to hold elections for a constituent assembly by mid-May next year and to ask the Election Commission to make preparations for the same. The meeting, which started at 9.00 a.m. local time, was suspended until Thursday, with the leaders from both sides agreeing to meet again on 12 October. According to sources, the meeting had to be postponed until Thursday because the leaders could not reach agreement on the future of the king until the elections, the interim constitution and government, and the issue of weapons management. However, leaders from the seven-party alliance who took part in the summit talks today expressed optimism that agreement on all political issues would be reached on Thursday.
[passage omitted]
Meanwhile, various pressure groups who were waiting outside the prime minister's residence where the summit talks were held shouted slogan against the leaders for not reaching agreement. They accused the Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and the American Ambassador to Nepal James F. Moriarty for lengthening the summit talks. And they said that there was a conspiracy being hatched to send back the Maoists into armed conflict and they also blamed the leaders of the seven-party alliance for not respecting the wishes of the people to see agreement with the Maoists.
Despite protests by the media for not making any arrangement for the media to cover the summit talks last Sunday, the government made no arrangements today as well. Journalists were prevented from entering the venue of the talks and had to wait in the sun all day long.

The men, identified as Hiralal Shrestha and Gyalgen Tamang, were sentenced recently by a court in Xigatse, while two more Nepalese rebels were given seven and four years in prison respectively, the Kantipur newspaper reported.
The four were arrested last year at the border town of Khasa, it said.
Nepal's government and human rights group Amnesty International have urged China, which has ruled Tibet since 1951, to spare the lives of the two men sentenced to death.
Nepalese foreign ministry officials have called for a retrial and urged China to provide the two with legal representation.
Nepal's Maoist rebels are known to be using small arms smuggled from China.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives.

    The U.S. embassy in Nepali capital Kathmandu Thursday issued a  press release saying that the United States welcomed the decision  by the UDMF to sign a political agreement with the Nepali  government.
    ""We expect this agreement will lead the UDMF parties to end  their Terai bandh (general strike) with immediate effect and will  pave the way for the three parties to participate fully in the  upcoming Constituent Assembly election on April 10. We expect  further that both sides will fulfill the terms of the agreement,""  the statement said.
    The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu Thursday also released a  statement saying that   India welcomed the agreement. ""It is our  hope that all parties would honor and implement this agreement and their previous understandings,"" the statement said.
    A meeting of the Nepali cabinet Thursday evening have endorsed  the eight-point agreement signed with the UDMF.
    The Nepali government and the agitating UDMF Thursday afternoon inked an eight-point agreement in capital Kathmandu. UDMF hence  called off its 16-day agitation since Feb. 13 after the signing of the pact.
    The eight-point agreement is reported to include clauses that  Madhes and other federal states would be recognized as autonomous  regions; proportional recruitment of the Madhesi and other  marginalized people in the Nepal Army; and inviting other armed  outfits of the Terai to a negotiation table; among others.
    UDMF is an alliance of three major Madhes-based parties --  Madhesi People's Rights Forum (MPRF), Terai Madhes Democratic  Party (TMDP) and Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP). Formerly, it put  forth a six-point demand to the government and required that to be met by calling on indefinite strike in Terai region since Feb. 13. The strike and sporadic curfew has affected preparation for the CA poll and normal life around the country severely. Five people were reportedly killed in the unrest.
    Madhesi people are the Nepalese mainly living in south Nepal's  Terai plains, who are socio-culturally close to the bordering  Indians.

"7664",20112966,"Title: Abduction hushed up to hide red sandalwood run.rtf; Date: July 20, 2011 Wednesday; Text: KATHMANDU, July 20 -- In the wake of a heated blame game regarding red sandalwood smuggling, amongst senior Maoist leaders at the largest party's just-concluded standing committee meeting, an abduction took place a few days ago within the smuggling circle, with the significant involvement of Maoist leaders.
The incident, which both the adbuction perpetrators and the victim want to hust up in view of 'larger interests', arises from a dispute between two factions over the division of spoils in a new smuggling venture, police said.
The red sandalwood racket is said to have comprised three Maoists leaders named as Dipak Sapkota, Mausham and Deepak Shrestha. Mausham and Shrestha are reportedly senior YCL leaders based in the capital. Sapkota's identity, investigative officials said, is yet to be verified completely as there are several possible angles concerning this name.
Metropolitan Police Crime Division (MPCD) has arrested the abduction perpetrator and victim-Krishna Shrestha, 29, and Netra Shrestha, 24, of Sindhupalchowk - who happen to be uncle and nephew by family relation. Krishna and his group had reportedly held Netra captive Sunday at a hotel in the capital. Netra's brother Asish, who lives in Britain, had informed MPCD about it.
As police started tracking down the abductors, matters took a dramatic turn. Netra was promptly set free. By the time Krishna was arrested on Monday, both sides had reached an understanding to hush up the whole case. ""That Netra's brother informed us was pure chance. He did so because he felt his brother's life was under threat. The volte-face came about for fear of police intervening in the smuggling, as that could harm both sides,"" said an investigative official.
As both sides were bent on hiding the case, Kathmandu police has opted to book them only on a public offence charge in hopes of developing a separate case within 25 days concerning red sandalwood smuggling.
Officials said that Krishna's group, which included three Maoists, had picked up Netra after the latter seized a huge bulk of red sandalwood in Chitwan and took it to Nawalparasi on Thursday. Netra was supposed to transport the consignment of over four tons worth around Rs 12.5 million from Chitwan to Kathmandu as per a deal with Krishna's group, which was to smuggle it into Tibet.
The group's last consignment was seized by police two months ago at Chautara, Sindhupalchwok district, and that set the racketeers back around Rs 30 million. Officials said, ""Netra wanted a good share in the new deal as he had lost heavily when the earlier venture faltered. So he seized the consignment and started negotiating with Krishna"".
""Krishna's group in turn abducted him,"" officials said.
Krishna said during preliminary interrogations that Sapkota had directed him to capture Netra and get back the consignment.
Police have not yet been able to recover the consignment hidden by Netra at Kawasoti, Nawalparasi. ""We will be able to build up the case once we recover the consignment,"" the officials also said.
The incident has taken place at a time when the UCPN (Maoist) has formed a high-level probe after mud-slinging between politburo member and Minister for Information and Communication Agni Sapkota and lawmaker Raj Kumar Shrestha regarding red sandalwood smuggling peaked during the standing committee meeting. Sapkota and Shrestha were both elected to the CA from Sindhupalchowk district. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

Seven Maoists broke into the Gainda Wildlife Safari Hotel overnight, setting off a bomb that destroyed a one-month stock of beer and other cold drinks, hotel manager Sukhiram Chaudhari said.
""The powerful explosion panicked the tourists sleeping in the hotel but none of them and none of the employees were were injured,"" Chaudhary said.
The Chitwan park, a 19th-century haunt of British aristocrats, is popular with tourists hoping for a glimpse of tigers and rhinos.
The Maoists have regularly targetted infrastructure they see as benefitting the wealthy, although the rebels are never known to have harmed tourists themselves. More than 1.25 million Nepalese owe their jobs to tourism.
Separately, 12 troops fresh from military training were injured Sunday in a landmine blast in southwestern Nepal, an army official said.
In the capital Kathmandu, five Maoists early Monday barged into a court handling labour disputes, warned everyone to leave and set off a homemade bomb, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
More than 9,500 people have died in insurgency since 1996 when the Maoists declared a ""people's war"" to turn the world's only Hindu kingdom into a secular, communist republic.

Dismissed by some as a sexist anachronism, the Miss World Organisation is using Saturday's 57th contest to spread the message about HIV/AIDS. It also coincides with World AIDS Day.
It is the fourth time in the past five years the event has taken place in Sanya, on the southern island province of Hainan -- dubbed the ""Chinese Hawaii"". 
At Sanya a tourist resort boasting palm trees that overshadow sugar-white beaches has been eked out and largely separated from the more traditional and less affluent urban areas where the local population lives. 
This weekend all eyes will be focused there as Miss World 2007 will attract an estimated global audience of two billion people in more than 200 countries, according to the event's United Kingdom-based organisers.
And on Friday the 106 contests were taking part in last-minute rehearsals ahead of the live televised final at the Beauty Crown Plaza, which was specially built for when Sanya first hosted the event in 2003.
Hopes are high here that Miss China -- Zhang Zi Lin, a 23-year-old secretary from Beijing --- will live up to her billing as a pre-contest favourite and take the crown in front of what is likely to be a partisan audience.
Miss China's biggest threat could come from Ada Aimee De La Cruz, or Miss Dominican Republic. The 21-year-old student, whose ambition is ""to work in the beauty business,"" is red-hot favourite with one British bookmaker, ahead of Miss China and Miss Lithuania. 
Outsiders include Miss Belize, Miss Nepal, Miss Sierra Leone and Miss Singapore, as well as McKeyla Antoinette Richards, representing the small tropical Caribbean island of Curacao. 
Of the nations not represented, there is no Miss Myanmar (formerly Burma) and most Muslim-majority countries do not take part, although Miss Malaysia, Miss Indonesia and Miss Turkey are notable exceptions. 
There is also no contestant from Taiwan -- it and the Chinese mainland have governed themselves separately since their split in 1949 and ties between the pair remain tense. 
While Miss World draws sniggers in many developed countries, it has been linked to deadly violence in the past and the organisers are keen to use this year's contest to spread AIDS awareness.
In 2002, it was forced to move from Nigeria to London after more than 200 people were killed and 500 injured amid fighting between Muslims and Christians after a newspaper there suggested the Muslim prophet Muhammad would have chosen a wife from the contestants had he been alive. 
In the same year militant Islamic groups in Nigeria denounced the pageant as promoting promiscuity, and several contestants threatened to pull out in protest at a Sharia death sentence passed on a Nigerian woman convicted of adultery.
Miss World Organisation chairwoman Julia Morley, widow of contest founder Eric, has invited Nelson Mandela's eldest daughter and his grandson Mandla Mandela to be special guests on Saturday -- Mr Mandela's son Makgatho died of an AIDS-related illness and the family are active campaigners. 
""One of the major challenges that we face is HIV/AIDS,"" said Mandla at a press conference in Sanya on Thursday. ""We have lost loved members of our family, including my father. It was because of my father's passing that we decided to unite as a family to try to do something about the spread of the epidemic."" 
As well as being held on World AIDS Day, Miss World 2007 also comes a week after Chinese state media reported hotels in Beijing have been ordered to stock condoms in every room in response to a spike in new HIV infections in the capital.

"5862",2007245,"Title: Feature_ Nepalese celebrate new year By Rajeeb Tamrakar, Chen Qiaoyan.rtf; Date: November 10, 2007 Saturday 10:00 AM EST; Text: Nepalese at home and abroad  celebrated Nepal Era 1128 amid various fanfares on Saturday.
    In Nepali capital Kathmandu, hundreds of thousands of people  took part in processions and motorcycle rally organized by various groups and clubs to mark the New Year.
    Nepal Sambat, a unique calendar which is named after the  country is based on lunar calendar. 
    According to legends, the calendar started during 881 AD when  Shankhadhar Shakhwa, a local merchant from Kathmandu, paid off the debts of common people on his own, thus emancipating thousands of  people from serfdom.
    However, after King Prithivi Narayan Shah, the ancestor of the  present monarch of Nepal, captured Kathmandu in 1769, he made  Bikram Sambat the official calendar of the country, putting an end to the official use of Nepal Era which was until then in  continuous official use for 888 years, from 881 to 1769 AD.
    Speaking to Xinhua on Saturday, a prominent Newar leader, Padma Ratna Tuladhar, said that the Nepali government should use Nepal  Era as the national calendar along with Gorgian calendar. At  present the Nepali government is using Bikram Era as the official  calendar.
    Stating that Nepal Sambat should be used as official calendar  by the government, he said, ""When we have our own calendar, there  is no sense in using Bikram Era which is named after an Indian  king.""
    He also urged all Nepali people not to consider Nepal Sambat  merely the New Year belonging to the Newar ethnic community but  take it as the national calendar.
    Meanwhile, leaders of various political parties of Nepal  extended greetings to all on the occasion of Nepal Era.
    Prime Minister Koirala, while addressing a mass meet organized  after the rally Saturday morning, said that the occasion must be  innovated as the vehicle to bolster social unity. 
    Koirala recently announced that he would be using Nepal Era in  his official letter pads.
    Meanwhile, people belonging to the Newar community are  performing ""Mha Puja"" on Saturday. ""Mha Puja"" which means self- worship in the Newari language is a unique ritual of worshipping  one's own body. 
    Considering body and soul as two different entities, Newars  worship their own body to thank the body for rendering services  throughout the year.
    Worshipping one's own body is also a way of worshipping gods  residing within every human being. As per the rituals, Newars  purify their body on this day and then worship their own body  sitting in front of a ritual octagon made of rice flour which is  then decorated with flowers and puffed paddy. They give themselves blessings to remain healthy and happy for the rest of the year.

"4605",20064587,"Title: Young Nepalese Lead Their Nation's Push for Democracy.rtf; Date: April 14, 2006 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
The Nepalese New Year dawns on Friday, with Nepal's young lashing furiously at the past.
  ''We will not ask the king to leave the throne -- we will go and take the throne and put it on display,'' Gagan Thapa, 29, the political symbol of young Nepal, told a crowd of thousands on the outskirts of this capital on Thursday. The vast majority, dressed in baseball caps and jeans and looking well below the age of 30, roared in approval.
A brassy antimonarchy call-and-response echoed through the warren of terraced lanes.
  ''We will burn the crown,'' Mr. Thapa shouted.
  ''Burn the crown, burn the crown,'' the crowd hollered back.
  The irrepressible protests that have gripped Nepal in the last several days, demanding the end of palace rule and the reinstatement of Parliament, are a function of demography and its discontent.
  Young Nepal has been at the forefront of this week's rambunctious, often violent pro-democracy protests, which have left four people dead. Whether Nepal descends into further tumult or sees the dawning of a new political age in the Nepalese calendar year of 2063 will depend on whether the protesters can be appeased.
  With his country's crisis mounting by the day, King Gyanendra seemed to make the slightest of nods in that direction. In a brief statement read on state-owned television shortly before midnight, he called for general elections ''with the active participation of all political parties committed to peace and democracy.''
  But the king said nothing about when elections would be held or, more important, whether he would concede to elections to review the Constitution, something the country's coalition of political parties and the Maoist rebels insist on.
  Whether the gesture restores peace in the Himalayan kingdom will depend on the reaction on Friday from the uncompromising throngs of young people who today represent his most formidable foe. 
  Nearly 60 percent of Nepal's 23 million citizens are under 24. They came of age after democracy came to Nepal in April 1990, and they have tasted the fruits and failures of electoral politics. They have seen a Maoist rebellion put much of the countryside through the wringer. 
  In February 2005, they saw their king suspend Parliament and install prime ministers of his own choosing in a bid, as he said, to defeat a bruising Maoist insurgency. For 14 months, they have lived under the king's direct rule. 
  Last week, he banned protests here in the capital and for six days imposed a daytime curfew.
  That order has not stopped young people from defiantly pouring out into the streets. They have been taking the lion's share of police beatings. On just one day this week, of the 59 people admitted to Katmandu's main teaching hospital for treatment of their injuries, only 13 were over the age of 30.
  Consider the verdict of Shashi Sigdel, a 22-year-old medical student on the shift in attitudes toward the king.
  ''My grandfather used to think he is a god,'' Mr. Sigdel said. ''My parents used to think he stands between God and the devil. Me, I think he's the devil. That's the generation gap.''
  On Thursday, the government restored cellphone service, suspended for nearly a week, and lifted the curfew in the capital. The ban on protests in Katmandu and several other cities continued -- as did the protests. 
  The Royal Nepalese Army has been dispatched to some of the demonstrations. But so far, it has largely refrained from open confrontation with the demonstrators. Of the four people killed in the demonstrations, at least two died by army fire.
  A protest by the Nepal Bar Association on Thursday morning ended with the police beating of dozens of demonstrators; nearly 50 landed in the hospital, including two whose heads had been grazed by rubber bullets.
  In a statement on Thursday, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights hinted that the use of excessive force by police officers could jeopardize Nepal's participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions, a good source of income for the country. 
  ''One would expect them to be respectful of United Nations standards in their conduct at home,'' Ian Martin, the High Commissioner's representative in Nepal, said in an interview Thursday night.
  Pro-democracy demonstrations have been commonplace since the royal takeover of February 2005, but none have been as intense, sustained or violent as the ones unfolding over the last week. The Maoists have given their blessings to the protests, having signed a peace deal of sorts last fall with a coalition of Nepal's seven largest political parties.
  Thousands of Nepalese, including lawyers, journalists and other professionals with no explicit links to political parties, have been arrested over the past week. The palace has accused Maoists of infiltrating the ranks of the protesters. 
  The young people who have been on the front lines of these protests are the children of parliamentar"
"6516",20083770,"Title: 1,000 Tibetan protesters arrested in Nepal _ police.rtf; Date: August 14, 2008 Thursday 12:38 PM GMT; Text: Stick-wielding police in Nepal's capital Kathmandu arrested at least 1,000 Tibetan exiles Thursday as they protested outside a Chinese embassy building, police and witnesses said.
The protesters, many of them monks and nuns, said they wanted to highlight what they say are abuses in their Himalayan homeland during the ongoing Beijing Olympics.
""The world must open its eyes to the plight of us Tibetans rather than focusing on the Beijing Olympics,"" Wangchuk Tsering, 28, told AFP before joining the protest.
""I will continue to protest unless China guarantees human rights in Tibet.""
Demonstrators wore T-shirts and jackets that read ""China lies, Tibetan dies,"" ""Stop genocide in Tibet,"" ""Long live the Dalai Lama"" and other slogans.
Police initially charged a group of about 1,000 Tibetans outside the Chinese visa and trade section building, hitting them with bamboo sticks. Half of them were arrested and the others were chased away.
The protesters later regrouped, and police arrested more than 500 others throughout the day.
So far, ""1,068 Tibetan protesters have been rounded up from around the protest site. They will be released later this evening,"" said Kathmandu police chief Sarbendra Khanal.
""They kept on coming so we continued detaining them because they were in a place where protests are prohibited.""
There have been almost daily pro-Tibet protests in Kathmandu since a crackdown in the Chinese-controlled region following violent unrest in March.
Nepal, which is home to around 20,000 exiled Tibetans, has banned all pro-Tibet protests as it seeks to maintain friendly ties with its giant northern neighbour China.
Tibetans began arriving in Nepal in large numbers in 1959 after the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, fled his homeland following a failed anti-Chinese uprising.

"5129",20062885,"Title: Nepal communist rebels free official held hostage since last month.rtf; Date: May 12, 2006 Friday 5:00 AM GMT; Text: Communist rebels have freed an official who was taken hostage after an attack in a southern Nepal town during political upheaval in the Himalayan country last month, officials said Friday.
The Maoist rebels freed District Administrator Bhodraj Adhikari late Thursday and he safely reached a government outpost early Friday, said senior Home Ministry official Biswa Prakash Pandit.
The release came hours after Home Minister Krishna Sitaula pleaded with the rebels to free him, in order to help create a conducive environment for proposed government-rebel peace talks meant to end decade-long fighting.
Adhikari and 19 police officers were captured after an April 5 rebel attack on government buildings and security bases in Malangawa, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, Katmandu.
The police were freed 10 days later, but Adhikari was kept captive.
A new government took charge of Nepal late last month after weeks of sometimes violent street protests forced King Gyanendra to relinquish the absolute power he seized on Feb. 1, 2005, when he claimed the move was necessary to combat corruption and end a decade-long communist rebellion.
The new government on Thursday freed Matrika Yadav, the highest-ranking imprisoned Maoist leader, and midlevel rebel Suresh Ale. Both had been arrested in India, extradited to Nepal and jailed for two years on terrorism charges.
Also Thursday, the rebels freed five policemen they had abducted Tuesday night as the officers patrolled a highway near Bhumahi, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of the capital, Katmandu.
The communist rebels, who have fought government forces since 1996, are no longer outlawed and the new government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala is trying to disarm them and get them to join the political mainstream.

  ""It is not only me, even the government is unaware of this issue,"" Kantipur Report quoted Nepal Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat as saying.
  Mahat said that even he learnt about the arms-carrying airplane stranded at Ahmedabad in India through media reports. He said he had learnt that an arms deal was inked during the royal regime.
  The government is carrying out investigations as to how the weapons were brought to India, he added.
  The Minister said the weapons would be sent back if they were indeed on their way to Nepal.
  ""Even if they are to be brought in, they could be stored and not used against the people,"" he added.
  A plane from Ukraine carrying the consignment via India to Nepal was forced to land at Ahmedabad airport after the Nepal Government told the External Affairs Ministry in India, on August 26, that it knew nothing about such a consignment.
  The consignment included rifles, ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles manufactured in Israel.
  The issue came to light when New Delhi asked the Nepal government about the plane and whether to provide airspace to it or not.

""The industrial houses and hoteliers of Nepal have been gripped with panic following the Maoist threat to shut down the operation of dozens of major industries in the capital and others in outside districts,"" said the Federation of Nepal Chambers and Industries, an umbrella organisation of Nepalese entrepreneurs.
""Several industrial enterprises are on the verge of closure due to the abnormal situation resulting from the conflict and violence.""
The pro-Maoist union All Nepal National Free Trade Federation said in a statement last week that notices had been sent to 24 prominent firms warning them to shut their businesses or ""face the consequences"".
The union's chairman Salikram Jamkatel said it had given the government a list of demands, including the release of arrested unionists and the payment of compensation for those killed in clashes with the security forces, but these had been ignored.
He also accused the 24 businesses his group had singled out of exploiting its workers.
Among the enterprises targeted are the deluxe hotel Soaltee-Crowne Plaza, the Surya Tobacco Company, the Aqua Mineral Water factory, Bottlers' Nepal (a Coca-Cola company), Elite Petrol Station, a string of garment and fabric factories and steel rolling mills.

Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 1 August
Rajbiraj [town in southeastern Nepal], 31 July: Convenor of the People's Democratic Terai [southern plains] Liberation Front Gaya Krishna Goit has said that anyone posing an obstacle to the independence of the Terai would be a target for the front's bullets.
He said this at a special meeting with Rajdhani held at an unknown location on Monday [31 July]. The part of the Terai now within Nepal was not territory conquered by the Shah kings but was independent Terai land since time immemorial that became a target for the English at various times and was acquired through treaty between the English and Nepal. He further said that according to the peace agreement between the governments of India and Nepal in 1950 after India became independent, all old treaties [between the two sides] were scrapped, thereby making the Terai independent too.
However, after that the Terai people lagged behind because they joined the movement against Rana [family] rule [as published] instead of working for their own self-rule.
Since 1951 a concerted infiltration of the Terai started and the citizenship law introduced in 1952 sought to make the Terai people Indians, Goit alleged. He said we are neither of Indian nor of Nepali origin.
If we are of Terai origin and the Terai is independent, why become citizens of somewhere else? He also revealed that there was a strategy for organizations, parties and civil society acting in the name of the Madhesi [people of the Terai] to work together for a roundtable conference and for a new constituent assembly. Disclosing that he was for peace and that his movement was both peaceful and armed, Goit said even [Indian independence leader] Mahatma Gandhi, who is known for his non-violence, had taught that arms should be taken up for the sake of justice. He also said that he was ready to sit for talks if the government prepared the environment for that.
He said that as there was discrepancy between what the Maoists say and what they do and as the liberation of the Terai was not possible through them, the front had been formed after breaking away from the Maoists.
He also disclosed that as the Maoists are the first obstacle for the Terai liberation front in expanding its organization to the villages and then entering the cities to take on the state, the Maoists would be targeted by them. The front had expanded from Sunsari [district in eastern Nepal to Parsa [district in south-central Nepal] and it was developing in Jhapa and Morang [districts in eastern Nepal] and Rupendehi [in mid-western Nepal]. Contacts had already been made in Banke and Bardiya [districts in mid-western Nepal] and Kailali and Kanchanpur [in far-western Nepal], he said.

Nepalgunj [mid-west Nepal], 6 October: Deputy president of Nepali Congress Sushil Koirala has said that management of the Maoist weapons will be the main agenda of the summit talks to be held on Sunday [8 October].
Koirala expressed the hope that the high level talks would finalize the issue of arms management.
Talking to journalists in Nepalgunj, Koirala said, ""Arms management will be the main agenda of the summit talks. All the seven political parties will raise the issue. We hope that the Maoists will respond positively to it.""
Koirala said that the modalities of the arms management would be discussed during the high level talks. He expressed the hope that the next summit talks would be successful. He called for commitment to the understanding reached between the Maoists and the seven party alliance (SPA).
""I am fully confident that the talks would be successful. The problems will be solved. Order will be restored and the future of democracy will be bright,"" Koirala said. This calls for commitment from everyone.
If some people failed to act with honesty for the interests of the nation, there is also danger to the very existence of the nation, Koirala cautioned. He said that the Maoists were acting honestly to make the summit talks meaningful.
""I talked with the Maoist leaders for three times. I found them highly committed. I urged them to forget about the past and move forward unitedly,"" Nepali Congress deputy president Koirala said.
Koirala was of the view that the parliament should not be dissolved until the election of the constituent assembly is held. Instead, the Maoists may be represented in the parliament, he said.
Unification of divided Congress parties is at the final stage, Koirala said and added that the unification announcement is expected shortly. However, he did not mention the date. ""You can rest assured that the unification announcement will come soon,"" he said.

After UN chief Ban Ki-moon reported on plans for joint UN-African Union (AU) peacekeeping in Darfur, the 15-member body adopted a statement urging all Darfur parties ""to attend and to engage fully and constructively in the talks"" scheduled to begin in the Libyan resort of Sirte Saturday.
The non-binding text also appealed to the parties ""as a first step, to urgently agree and implement a cessation of hostilities to be overseen by the United Nations and the African Union.""
The Sirte talks are the latest international effort to end the bloodshed in Darfur.
The council threatened unspecified action, meaning sanctions, ""against any party that seeks to undermine the peace process, including by failing to respect such a cessation of hostilities or by impeding the talks, peacekeeping, or humanitarian aid.""
Meanwhile UN envoy Jan Eliasson, who along with his AU counterpart Salim Ahmed Salim is mediating the Sirte talks, pointed to indications that several key Darfur rebel leaders ""are not ready to come.""
In a video conference from the Eritrean capital Asmara, he told reporters here that he was urging the recalcitrant Darfur rebel leaders to reconsider, saying they would be given ""plenty of time to have consultations among themselves"" in Sirte.
""The real negotiation will start only after we have had the full preparation of the parties,"" he added.
Wednesday, the Islamist Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) headed by Khalil Ibrahim became the latest rebel group to signal its intention to boycott the meeting.
Six other groups, including hardline Darfur rebel chief Abdel Wahid Mohammed Nur's faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement, had announced Tuesday they would boycott the talks.
Eliasson said Khalid Ibrahim, however, gave assurances that he would send a representative to the Sirte talks at which Khartoum has pledged to announce a ceasefire.
Only the SLM/A faction of Khamis Abdallah Bakr has said it will attend the Sirte talks, while the SLM-Unity grouping has yet to announce a clear position.
The council also expressed ""deep concern at the delays in deploying UNAMID (the UN-AU peacekeeping force)"" and urged UN member states ""to urgently make available the aviation and ground transport units still required for UNAMID and for all parties in Darfur to facilitate and expedite UNAMID's effective deployment.""
The UN and the AU have so far agreed to accept troops for UNAMID from at least 16 countries, mostly from Africa but also from Thailand, Bangladesh, Jordan, Nepal, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries.
But Khartoum has yet to consent to the dispatch of some of the non-African troops, including those from Nepal and Scandinavia.
UNAMID still lacks 24 transport and tactical helicopters and related personnel that are meant to give it sufficient mobility and firepower at a time when Sudanese government troops and rebel fighters are locked in a fresh round of fighting.
The bulk of the force, which is to comprise more than 19,000 military personnel, over 6,000 police and over 5,500 civilians, is not expected to be on the ground in Darfur, a region the size of France, until well into next year.
The council also voiced ""strong concern at the continuing deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur and urges all parties to exercise restraint immediately, avoiding retaliation and escalation.""
More than two million people have fled their homes and at least 200,000 have died in Darfur from the combined effects of famine and conflict since Khartoum enlisted militia allies to put down a revolt in 2003, according to the UN.

The new law endorsed by legislators late Saturday scraps the king's right to reject bills and laws passed by Parliament, Speaker Subash Nemwang said Sunday.
Lawmakers also will no longer need to seek the king's approval before signing a bill into law, he said.
""This regulation has eliminated any and all authority the king had in Parliament. From now on the Parliament is independent to draft new laws and enforce them,"" Nemwang said.
It was the latest in a string of laws enacted by Parliament to dramatically cut Gyanendra's authority after weeks of protests against his dictatorial rule forced him to relinquish powers in April.
Lawmakers hailed the new regulation.
""The concept of king in Parliament has been abolished through law,"" said Ram Baran Yadav, a legislator of the Nepali Congress, the country's largest party.
""We are now free to criticize the king and the royal family members in Parliament,"" said Laxmi Shakya, a lawmaker from the Communist Party of Nepal.
Last month, Parliament voted unanimously in favor of a resolution that stripped Gyanendra of his command over the army, legal immunity, and freedom from paying taxes. The resolution still has to be voted into law.
The king also lost his official position as head of the Himalayan nation, changing traditional references to ""His Majesty's government"" to simply the ""Nepal government.""
Also Sunday, Nepal's home minister, Krishna Sitaulam flew to a remote village 200 miles west of the capital to meet the Communist rebels' elusive leader, Prachanda, and his deputy, Baburam Bhattarai, Nepal TV said.
It was the first face-to-face meeting between top government officials and the rebel leaders since the two sides declared a cease-fire and began peace talks.
The cease-fire with the Maoists is a major priority. The insurgents' decade-long insurgency killed more than 13,000 people, but they played a key role in the protests that forced the monarch to give up total power.
The rebels are insisting the government dissolve Parliament, while the government wants to continue with the legislature until a special assembly is elected that would rewrite the constitution.
Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, has accused the government and ruling alliance of focusing on minor issues rather than key parts of the peace process, such as creating a more inclusive interim government.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala expanded his Cabinet Sunday, adding a deputy prime minister and two other ministers, a government statement said, giving the Cabinet 21 members.
The Cabinet now has representation from six of the ruling alliance's seven parties. One has refused to be part of the Cabinet, but will stay in the alliance.
The seven major parties in the alliance organized street protests that forced Gyanendra to give up powers he seized last year, reinstate Parliament and appoint Koirala as prime minister in April.

"1303",20032299,"Title: Nepal PM hits out at political leaders for doubting peace process.rtf; Date: March 23, 2003 Sunday; Text: Nepal Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand has hit out at political leaders for doubting the intentions of the government in holding peace talks with Maoist rebels, state-run radio said Sunday.
""It is regrettable that the political parties should doubt the intention of the government when it is creating hopes of reviving peace in the country,"" Chand said in a programme on communications and constitution organised by the Federation of Editors and Publishers.
""While other kinds of doubts can be easily dispelled, there is no way to convince the leaders of the political parties about the intention of the government when they question its honesty,"" he said.
Party leaders, including Nepal Communist Party - United Marxist Leninist general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, have said the Chand government's delays in starting formal talks with rebel leaders raised doubts about its intention to resolve the insurgency.
The government and the Maoists declared a truce in January this year to pave way for the peace talks to end the violence.
They signed a code of conduct last week but talks have yet to begin.
Narayan Singh Pun, the government minister negotiator in the peace talks, said Sunday the process was being delayed due to increasing demands by the rebels.
""The Maoists have demanded the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience as a precondition for talks,"" said Pun, who is also minister for physical planning and works.
""We are committed to fulfilling their demands but it takes some time to follow up due to the process of law,"" he said.
The procedural delay in fulfilling the rebels' demands, Pun added, should not be allowed to derail the negotiation process.
""I am still waiting to hold a first round of good-will talks with the Maoists, and it will begin immediately if they agree,"" he said.
The insurgency, launched in 1996 for a communist republic, has claimed more than 7,800 lives in Nepal.
During the radio programme, Chand also blamed political parties for the countrys current political crises, saying that since 1990, most prime ministers had dissolved parliament ""to save their skins.""
The dissolution of the parliament had only resulted in destabilising the country, he said.
Multiparty democracy was reinstated in Nepal in 1990 following a movement against the partyless system.

Ganesh Chiluwal, who was president of the Maoist Victims Association, was in his office in the heart of the capital when gunmen shot him three times, killing him instantly, a police official said.
No one was immediately arrested.
Chiluwal had served as the elected head of a village council at Lamjung in western Nepal at the beginning of the Maoist insurgency and was taken captive by the rebels.
He was released in a police raid and went on to form the Maoist Victims Association to publicise rebel abuses.
His killing came two days after he led a rally in Kathmandu in which protesters burned effigies of Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is better known as Prachanda, or ""The Fierce.""
The rebels, who want to overthrow the monarchy, have frequently targetted perceived local supporters of the Nepalese government during their eight-year insurgency which has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

"2078",20044449,"Title: Nepal reviewing latest mountaineering record on Everest.rtf; Date: June 10, 2004 Thursday; Text: Nepalese officials are investigating the Mount Everest record set by a Sherpa guide, after rival climbers questioned his claim to have raced from the base camp to the peak in 8 hours and 10 minutes - more than 2 1/2 hours less than the previous record.
A government committee plans to take two weeks to review the record-setting climb in May by 26-year-old Pemba Dorjee and allegations by rivals - include the fellow Sherpa whose record was shattered - that Dorjee's claim is bogus,Tourism Ministry official Shanker Pandey said.
""We have asked both Pemba and those challenging his record to provide us with proof,"" Pandey said.
The climb from the 5,300-meter (17,380-foot) base camp to the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit usually takes about four days.
The ministry announced May 21 that Dorjee had set a new record with a climb lasting 8 hours, 10 minutes, based on reports from a government liason at the base camp. The previous record was set last year by another ace Sherpa guide, Lakpa Gyelu, in 10 hours and 56 minutes.
""I have all the proof and followed all the mountaineering rules in achieving my record. They are just jealous and angry that I broke the old record,"" Dorjee said.
Dorjee said that once he reached the summit about 2 a.m. local time, he called the liaison official on his radio and described to him in detail the things that were left at the summit by the climber who reached it a day earlier.
Dorjee was the only one to climb the peak on that day because the weather was unfavorable and climbers were not taking the risk.
Dorjee, however, said snow that day was confined to the base camp and there was no wind, and that after 6,000 meters (feet), the weather was fine.
""There was no one above 6,400 meters (feet) on that day so there were no eyewitnesses. We are asking him to provide proof like photographs that he actually made the climb,"" said Gyelu, whose record was broken. ""The weather was so bad that day there is no way he could have made the climb.""
Pandey, the Tourism Ministry official, said he could not comment until the committee finishes its work.
Dorjee last year climbed the peak in a record 12 hours and 45 minutes, but his mark was eclipsed three days later by Gyelu.
Sherpas were mostly yak herders and traders living high in the Himalayas until Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for foreign mountaineers.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, more than 1,400 climbers have scaled the mountain. About 180 people have died on its unpredictable slopes.

""At least three policemen of the Armed Police Force were killed and two others injured when they clashed with Maoist rebels near Ragha airport in Nepalgunj, far southwestern Nepal Thursday evening,"" a police official said.
""In the clashes, the rebels are also learnt to have suffered some casualties,"" the official, who did not wish to be identified, said.
Authorities were awaiting further details of the clashes, the official said.
In other violence, three soldiers were injured in a bomb blast by suspected Maoists in western Nepal Thursday, the army said.
One bomb exploded near an army vehicle in the western tourist town of Pokhara and the other went off at a local government education office in Morang in the southeast.
""Three soldiers were injured in the Pokhara blast,"" a top army official told AFP. Pokhara is 225 kilometres (140 miles) west of Kathmandu.
""No one is injured in Morang district in the (other) explosion,"" the army official said.
Earlier local police had said two civilians were injured in Morang, 540 kilometres southeast of Kathmandu.
The two explosions are the seventh and eighth blasts since the end of the Maoist ceasefire this week but none has caused any deaths.
Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Pranchanda called off the four-month-old truce in a statement Monday, blaming continued military action by the army.
He said the rebels would resume hostilities against government forces but not target civilians, a move welcomed by human rights organization.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.

"62",20031632,"Title: Tibetan Buddhist festival concludes peacefully in India despite threats.rtf; Date: January 20, 2003 Monday; Text: Despite a threat from some Indian monks to immolate themselves, the biggest religious gathering in Tibetan Buddhism concluded peacefully Monday with the departure of the Dalai Lama.
The Kalachakra Initiation held at the Bodh Gaya complex in eastern Bihar state - where Buddhists believe the founder of their religion received enlightenment - drew an estimated 150,000 devotees, including 13,000 monks, from 100 countries.
But that's just half what organizers had expected at the eight-day ceremony.
The gathering passed off more smoothly than last year, when there was overcrowding and widespread illness, and the Dalai Lama had to cut short his appearance to be hospitalized because of a stomach ailment.
About 2,300 devotees came from Tibet, 1,000 more than last year, when China tightened travel restrictions ahead of the event.
Senior Tibetan monks in attendance included the Karmapa, who is the third highest-ranking Tibetan monk; Ling Rinpoche, the monk whom Tibetans believe is the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama's tutor; and the Ganden Tripa, the head of the Dalai Lama's sect. Like the Dalai Lama, all three monks live in exile in India.
Security was tightened ahead of this year's Kalachakra, after a group of disgruntled Indian Buddhist monks threatened to immolate themselves in protest against the Dalai Lama's presence. The monks were subsequently arrested.
Four youths from Nepal and Tibet were also arrested for drunkenness.
It was the second straight year the All India Monks Federation had threatened trouble. The Federation, which is seeking to take control of the main temple at Bodh Gaya, has demanded the deportation of the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa, accusing the Tibetan government-in-exile of receiving about US$100 million in aid annually from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
The Kalachakra, which means ""Wheel of Time,"" is one of the highest teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, involving four days of elaborate ritual, prayer and the construction of a sand mandala, a circular design symbolizing the universe.
The Dalai Lama donated 1 million rupees (US$21,000) for social welfare programs in the area where the ceremony was held. The Bodh Gaya complex is located in Bihar, one of India's poorest states.
The Dalai Lama headed Monday to a conference in Varanasi and will then take a one-month retreat at his home in Dharmsala, in northern India. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after a failed 1959 revolt against Chinese rule.

The women were searching for herbs used for traditional medicine near Narku village in Dolpa district, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) northwest of the capital Katmandu, when the forest caught fire, the Kantipur newspaper reported.
The report quoted Surya Prasad Bhandari, the district chief, as saying a child had allegedly started the blaze.
Bhandari said the fire began at the bottom of the mountain where the women were, and quickly reached the top, giving them little time to flee the flames.
The village is in one of the most remote and undeveloped districts in this Himalayan nation, and cannot be reached by road. The only access is by plane, but there are no regular flights.

Police estimate some 1,400 teachers and students have been abducted over the past week from four war-torn districts in the Himalayan kingdom.
""The Maoists have been giving armed combat training and revolutionary education to the abductees to absorb them in the (rebel) army before the Maoists launch a nationwide attack,"" Bam Dev Kshetri, a Maoist central committee member, told AFP.
Kshetri declined to specify when the attack was planned for. The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to turn the world's only Hindu kingdom into a secular communist republic.
On Sunday, a bomb tore through a bus in Kathmandu outside the head office of state-run Royal Nepal Airlines, killing a civilian and wounding 21 other passengers.
Such attacks are rare in the capital. Deadly fighting is concentrated in the countryside where the Maoists have stepped up abductions of students and teachers to force them into indoctrination sessions.
Police say the largest-scale kidnappings in the past week were in the western Jajarkot district, where the rebels snatched at least 500 students and 300 teachers from 270 schools.
Suomi Sakai, the resident representative in Nepal of the UN children's agency UNICEF, appealed to the Maoists to release the hostages.
""To ensure schools as zones of peace, disruptive activities should not take place within 500 metres from its area,"" he said in a statement.
Leading Nepalese human rights activist Subodh Pyakurel estimated that more than 12,000 students and teachers have been abducted and released since the rebels ended a ceasefire in August.
""The Maoists provide them with revolutionary education for periods of 10 days to two weeks,"" said Pyakurel, president of the independent rights group Informal Sector Service Centre.
The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.

The World Health Organization is working closely with these countries at the four-day meeting, which opened Monday, to strengthen their health systems and ensure there is coordination between the animal health and human health sectors, WHO officials said.
""In this part of the world in many countries, the public health infrastructure is not as good as â¦ Thailand or some other countries,"" said Jay Narain, director of WHO's communicable diseases department for Southeast Asia.
The countries have each drafted pandemic preparedness plans, which address early detection and response. Narain urged cooperation between the agriculture and public health officials.
""We are pushing for multi-sectoral response. If we do an effective poultry outbreak containment, we should be able to prevent infection in human beings,"" Narain said.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has ravaged poultry farms across Asia and has been transmitted to humans, killing at least 67 people since late 2003. Almost all of them came into close contact with infected birds.
Experts fear that the H5N1 virus could mutate into a form that can easily be passed from human to human, sparking a global flu pandemic.

""The elections will be held in 36 municipalities only, in the other 22 there will be no contest because there are not enough candidates,"" said spokesman Tejmuni Bajracharya.
Some 608 candidates who initially registered have already dropped out of the election race ""for personal reasons"" and 18 candidates have been rejected leaving only 3,028 candidates for 4,146 seats, Bajracharya said.
The polls are part of King Gyanendra's ""road map to democracy"" after he sacked the government and seized power last February. They have been branded a farce by opposition political parties, and rebel Maoists have threatened to disrupt them.
Private media reported at the weekend that some candidates are living in army camps out of fear of Maoist attacks. One prospective candidate has been killed by suspected Maoists.
""Where there is only one contestant for the post, the district election official will declare him or her the winner,"" the commission spokesman said.
In each of the 22 municipalities where there will be no polling, there is one candidate for mayor, who will be formally appointed. However, he or she will be faced with severe staff shortages because there is no provision for appointing people to elected positions.
The Maoists, who have been fighting to establish a communist republic since 1996, have called a week-long, nationwide general strike, timed to coincide with polling day on February 8.
Last November the Maoists and Nepali opposition parties formed a loose alliance to demand elections for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for the kingdom. 
King Gyanendra has promised to hold general elections by April 2007.
Since the Maoists began their ""people's war"" a decade ago, more than 12,500 people have been killed.

"110",20031068,"Title: Nepal _ Government, Maoists make _incremental progress_ in peace talks.rtf; Date: May 10, 2003, Saturday; Text: Text of report by Yuvraj Acharya, carried by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 10 May
 Kathmandu, 9 May: The government and Maoists made incremental progress in the second round of peace talks today with the former agreeing to release a few jailed rebels and even limiting the Royal Nepal Army to within 5 km of their barracks. The two sides also announced the formation of a monitoring and evaluation committee to oversee the implementation of the all-important code of conduct which governs behaviour during peace negotiations. The measures were announced after three hours of negotiations at Shanker Hotel in Kathmandu after the second round of peace negotiations on Friday 9 May .
 Later, addressing a joint-press conference, both sides said the talks were held in a cordial atmosphere and dwelt in large part on the list of demands put forth by the Maoists in the first round. Minister Narayan Singh Pun and rebel negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who addressed the news conference jointly, announced the small but significant progress in today's talks.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 10 May 03
Pun said that the government agreed not to mobilize its armed forces for search operations beyond a perimeter of 5 km from the barracks. The government also agreed to expedite the process of releasing the Maoist leaders who are in government custody and decided to immediately release three of them. He added that the process of releasing the Maoist leaders would be expedited as per the government's commitment made during the first round of peace talks on 27 April. Neither side, however, said whether the Maoists too had promised to limit their fighters from roaming inside the areas under the control of security forces.
 In the press conference, both Pun and Mahara stressed that the talks dwelt at length on the agendas put forward by the Maoists during the first round of peace talks. ""There was no new agenda entertained during today's talks,"" said Mahara, the spokesman of the Maoist negotiating team. He added that the government had asked for some more time to do homework on the political agendas the Maoists. ""Today's meeting just revolved around the measures to facilitate and manage the peace dialogue in the future,"" he added.
 ""We have arrived at an agreement to enter the political agendas of the Maoists,"" said Narayan Singh Pun, the spokesman of the government negotiating team. ""Discussions on the political agendas will be held after the matter is intensively discussed at the home work committee,"" he said. The homework committee was formed during the last peace talks comprising two members from both sides. Pun and Ramesh Nath Pandey are representing the government side, while Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) from the Maoists.
 The Maoists had put forward a 24-point agenda before the government, including three major political demands. They have demanded for convening a round table conference of all the political forces in the country, formation of an interim government under their leadership and writing of a new constitution through constituent assembly.
 The implementation of the code of conduct was one of the major concerns from the both sides in the light of allegations coming from the both sides for violating it. Pun said the code of conduct could not be implemented due to technical shortcomings from the both sides. ""Some managerial aspects are responsible for our partial failure to abide by the code of conduct but it will be corrected at the earliest,"" said Pun.
 As informed during today's press conference, both the negotiating parties said they have decided to form a 13-member committee to monitor the implementation of the code of conduct for cease-fire they agreed on 13 March and the ongoing peace process.
 The monitoring committee will consist of one representative each from six institutions such as National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Nepal Bar Association (NBA), Federation of Nepalese Journalist (FNJ), National Women Commission (NWC), Nepal Dalit Association (NDA), Association of Nepalese Nationalities (ANN) and Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI). NHRC representative will head the committee. Other individual members in the committee are Bal Krishna Neupane, Hem Bahadur Singh, Khim Lal Devkota, Malla K. Sundar, Dr Birendra Jhapali and D.R. Lamichhane.
 Today's talks also formulated a code of conduct for the monitoring committee ""with a view to make its functions systematic"". As per the code of conduct made at the talks today, the monitoring team will be responsible for interpreting the code of conduct in case of differences. According to Mahara, the committee will also monitor the implementation of code of conduct and expand its branches to every district of the country.
 Similarly, a code of conduct for the facilitators, who were named in the first round of talks on 27 April, was also formulated at the talks. As per "

"6758",20084082,"Title: Lonely life as commoner for Nepal 's former king.rtf; Date: July 20, 2008 Sunday 1:49 AM GMT; Text: With few friends coming to visit and his son and one-time heir now living in Singapore, the new life of Nepal's ousted king as a commoner is by all accounts a lonely, meditative one.
Former king Gyanendra spends his time writing poetry, praying, surfing the Internet and taking walks in the forest around the Nagarjun hunting lodge where he lives just outside the capital Kathmandu, guards and his spiritual adviser said.
""The former king has been spending most of his time inside the bungalow,"" said a military guard at the lodge. ""Occasionally I have seen him sitting in front of a computer or reading books. The place is quiet.""
Kanchha Shrestha, who runs a small sweet stall opposite the guarded gates of the reserve, has also noticed a lack of activity at the lodge.
""I haven't seen many people coming to visit except some former royal secretaries,"" said Shrestha, adding that the ex-king rarely left the premises. ""Sometimes he leaves once a week, sometimes once in 15 days.""
Those outings are most likely to involve visits to his elderly step-mother, in her 80s, who continues to live in Narayanhiti Palace in the heart of the city.
The concubine of Gyanendra's grandfather, in her 90s, also continues to reside at the palace, which was turned into a museum after the king's departure last month.
Gyanendra's new life looks set to become even quieter after his son, former crown prince Paras, left for Singapore earlier this month. The departure was followed by that of Paras' wife and three children on Thursday.
But the former king may have taken some comfort this week as he watched the political parties that ousted him in May and ended the 240-year-old Shah monarchy fall out over their choice for a new head of state.
The three main parties had each put forward a candidate for president but a vote by assembly members on Saturday failed to produce a clear winner and end the political deadlock that has delayed the formation of a new government.
The post of president, which is expected to take on some of the ceremonial duties once carried out by the king, will largely be symbolic as the new Maoist-led government writes a fresh constitution for now republican Nepal.
There is little sympathy in Nepal for the dour-faced ex-king who was widely disliked by his former subjects, some of whom accuse him of having a hand in the 2001 palace massacre that catapulted him to the throne.
Gyanendra ascended the throne after his nephew Dipendra, then crown prince, killed most of his family, including the king and queen, in a drink- and drug-fuelled rage after being prevented from marrying the woman he loved.
The former king's spiritual adviser said Gyanendra had weathered his losses in a stoic fashion.
""Many people have a heart attack or go into shock if they lose their job,"" said Madhab Bhattarai, who occasionally visits the king to advise him on prayer ceremonies.
""He lost the state but he doesn't show any grief. From outside you can't see any difference in his face.""

"5949",20071482,"Title: Nepal MPs say Maoists trying to prevent poll by setting conditions.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: August 18, 2007 Saturday
Excerpt from unattributed report headlined ""Nepal legistlators accuse Maoists of trying to abort polls by setting conditions"" published by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 18 August
Kathmandu, 17 August: MPs have accused the Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist of trying to sabotage the constituent assembly elections by raising various conditions and making excuses.
Legislators from other parties made this accusation while speaking at the meeting of the interim legislature-parliament Friday [17 August] during time allotted by the Speaker. The legislators suggested to the Maoists that they cooperate in fostering an atmosphere free of fear for the constituent assembly elections, and to adhere honestly to the peace agreement.
[Passage omitted: allegation made by Prakash Jwala of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN-UML)]
Jwala said: ""Raising preconditions now about a proportional system of elections and proclamation of a republic is only to sabotage the constituent assembly poll"".
His question was: ""Were the Maoists asleep when they agreed to go for a mixed system of elections?""
Accusing the Maoists of still not reforming their ways, he said: ""By dousing an MP with petrol and trying to burn him alive, the Maoists have proved that they have not reformed.""
Arjun Joshi of the Nepali Congress accused the Maoists of showing an authoritarian character by assaulting and interfering with the independent communications sector. He said ""It is a tragedy for democracy to try to make the independent press toe one party's line"".
Urbadatta Pant of the CPN-UML said the recent activities and conduct of the Maoists appear as obstacles to the constituent assembly elections.
Legislators from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), however, said that an attempt was being made to defame the Maoists as a hindrance to the constituent assembly by highlighting minor incidents and failings. MP Bamdev Chettri said the Maoists are the most serious and committed [party], as far as the constituent assembly elections are concerned. He said: ""If there are some weaknesses, we are ready to rectify things"". He said it is up to the government to foster an atmosphere for the constituent assembly elections.
Another Maoist MP, Dama Sharma, said: ""A conspiracy is afoot to make a mountain out of a molehill in order to portray the Maoists as obstructionist, and to prevent the constituent assembly poll from taking place"".

"2667",20043051,"Title: Nepal government says will prolong ceasefire provided rebels don't attack.rtf; Date: October 26, 2004 Tuesday 1:33 PM GMT; Text: The Nepal government vowed Tuesday to extend a ceasefire in a deadly Maoist revolt as long as rebels refrained from launching attacks.
The two sides began observing the ceasefire last week for the annual nine-day festival Dassain, which marks the triumph of good over evil and is the biggest religious holiday on the calendar of the world's only Hindu kingdom.
The truce in the kingdom, reeling from the increasingly bloody eight-year insurgency, was due to expire Thursday.
""This (ceasefire) policy will continue until the Maoists break it from their side,"" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba told reporters.
The move followed widespread appeals to both sides from human rights groups and political parties to extend the truce in the impoverished kingdom whose economic woes have been deepened by the conflict.
There has been no violation of the ceasefire by either side since it began.
However, government spokesman Mohammad Mohshin said Nepal was keeping the   ""army and security on high alert in case the Maoists start any armed action"".
Over 10,000 people have died since the Maoists began their armed uprising in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and install communist rule.
The government said it wants to resume peace talks with the Maoists that broke down in 2003 over the rebels' demand for a constituent assembly that would ultimately aim for the establishment of a secular communist republic.
It also said it was determined to press ahead with long delayed general elections.
Nepal fell into political chaos in 2002 when King Gyanendra assumed executive powers, dismissing Deuba and disbanding parliament. He accused Deuba  of incompetence in crushing the Maoist revolt.
He reinstated the prime minister four months ago after violent street demonstrations and has promised to hold elections by next April.
Deuba set up a four-party coalition government but other parties refused to join it, including a faction of the Nepali Congress party, saying it had been formed by the king and was undemocratic. They have continued to stage protests.
""Our top priority is to hold a peace dialogue with the Maoists to end the current armed confrontation and secondly to go for elections,"" the government spokesman said.
""We were given two mandates when the king formed the present all-party government which were restoration of peace through talks and secondly the holding of elections for the transfer of people's sovereign rights,"" he said.
""If the rebels don't come forward for peace talks and suspend armed action, we'll seek to transfer the people's sovereign rights through elections,"" he said.
The rebels have been holding out for UN involvement in any peace talks, a demand the government has rejected.

"7301",2011376,"Title: Strong quake hits northeastern India ; 16 dead.rtf; Date: September 18, 2011 Sunday 6:38 PM GMT; Text: A strong earthquake shook northeastern India and Nepal on Sunday night, killing at least 16 people, damaging buildings and sending lawmakers in Nepal's capital running into the streets.
The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, struck at 6:10 p.m. local time and was felt across northern and eastern India, including in the capital of New Delhi. It triggered at least two aftershocks of magnitude 6.1 and 5.3, Indian seismology official R.S. Dattatreyan said. He warned more aftershocks were possible.
At least five people in India's Sikkim state were killed and more than 50 were injured, according to the state's top official, Chief Secretary Karma Gyatso. The north Indian state of West Bengal reported four deaths, and Bihar state reported two. Nepal's government said five people died and dozens were hurt there, including two men and a child who were killed when a brick wall toppled outside the British Embassy in Nepal's capital, Katmandu.
The full extent of damage was not immediately known because the region is sparsely populated with many people living in remote areas now cut off by mudslides triggered by the quake, state police Chief Jasbir Singh told The Associated Press.
TV stations reported buildings buckled, sidewalks cracked and two major roads collapsed in Sikkim's state capital of Gangtok, 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of the quake's epicenter near the border with Nepal. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police said two of its buildings had collapsed in Gangtok.
Small army columns fanned out across the city of some 50,000 overnight to search for anyone pinned under fallen debris.
""We have sounded a high alert. Police are on the streets in Gangtok and other major towns,"" he said.
Electricity and some phone service was interrupted in the area.
Power lines snapped in the West Bengal cities of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which ""are now in total darkness,"" state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said, according to Press Trust of India.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered to send troops to help, and summoned the National Disaster Management Authority for an emergency meeting. The air force sent five planes to help with rescue efforts.
The region has been hit by major earthquakes in the past, including in 1950 and 1897.
In neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh, the quake Sunday night sent residents rushing out of their homes, offices and shopping centers.
In Katmandu, members of parliament who were debating the national budget ran out of the assembly hall into a parking area. They returned 15 minutes later and resumed their session.
The quake was also felt as far as the Indian capital, with New Delhi residents also rushing out of shaking buildings.
Associated Press writers Binaj Gurubacharya in Katmandu, Nepal, and Julhas Alam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, contributed to this report.

 Kathmandu, 25 January: Five parliamentary parties said the student movement for a republic is just and constitutional and indicated their protest will be directed towards a republic from March.
 The political parties for the first time formally supported the on-going effective and spiralling student youth protest and said it was part of a peaceful joint popular movement.
 The five political parties said the movement will be stronger and more effective. While the government has accused the political parties for inciting the students towards unconstitutional activities, the parties backing constitutional monarchy have now formally backed the students.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 26 Jan 04
The parties decided to support protests of women, labourers, farmers, intellectuals and different professional organizations as well.
 Senior leaders who met in the capital Sunday 25 January agreed the assurances of the King in recent audiences could not be relied upon. They came to such a conclusion after sharing experiences at an all-party meeting following the parleys with the King.
 With commitment to constitutional monarchy, they agreed to take the movement to a decisive phase by mid-April.  passage omitted
 ""The slogans of the students are against autocracy,"" CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-(Unified Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said in response to queries by reporters who asked if political parties were inciting students.
 But Congress central committee member Krishna Sitaula said the movement launched by students questioning the relevance of monarchy was the second chapter of the fight against regression. He said: ""We hope the King will not force us to launch the third chapter of the movement."" He warned if the King becomes autocratic, the third chapter of the protest will move for a republic by declaring the end of monarchy.
 He told Rajdhani: ""Right now, the country is moving towards a republic. Maoists will give up violence and join us in the movement."" passage omitted
 UML Unified Marxist-Leninist leader Bharat Mohan Adhikari said five political parties supported the youth student movement for a republic.

""The Maoists have abducted at least 450 students in the past several days from Tanahun, Palpa, and Baglung districts"" about 300 kilometers (188 miles) west of Kathmandu, an army official said on condition of anonymity.
The army said it had little information on where the students were being held, but termed the abductions ""inhuman and a violation of human rights.""
Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has already claimed more than 11,000 lives.
Rebels have stepped up operations since King Gyanendra sacked a four-party coalition government February 1 saying it had failed to tackle the rebellion, and seized power himself.
Rebels have been known to round up students to indoctrinate them with Maoist ideology, but normally return most of them safely.
The practice has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups who have appealed to the guerrillas to protect students from the violence.
Earlier Sunday, four international aid agencies suspended their operations in another district in western Nepal after their aid workers were beaten by Maoist rebels.
The World Food Programme, Britain's Department for International Development, the German Technical Cooperation, and the Dutch Aid Agency SNV, all ended their operations after investigating alleged beatings in the village of Sukariya, 550 kilometres (340 miles) west of Kathmandu.
""The investigation concluded that Maoist cadres seriously assaulted one male and one female staff member,"" the statement said.
The groups expressed regret over the suspension of their work, adding, ""But we cannot put our staff at further risk.

Text of report by Biplav Maharjan by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 16 August
Salyan, 16 August: Maoists have stalled all activities of non-governmental organizations in Salyan District [western Nepal], claiming that NGOs are not complying with the ""People's Government"". The rebels have claimed that NGOs have started working on their own, ignoring Maoist policies, after the restoration of democracy in the country.
Earlier, NGOs as well as government offices, especially in the rural areas of the district, operated ""in coordination"" with the Maoists, as the rebels didn't allow any organization to operate without their permission. The organizations had to register with the Maoists and also pay tax to their parallel government.
""Maoists may have been offended because most of the NGOs, in recent times, have shown no interest in registering with the Maoists and paying tax to them,"" opined Min Bahadur Wali, chairman of an NGO called Sharada Nepal.
NGOs have been claiming that the rebels have not only halted development works but also their training programmes everywhere in the district. 
""Only recently, our programme coordinators who had gone to Shreenagar Bazaar to train war-affected women in goat raising - for income generation - were not allowed to conduct the training by the Maoists,"" said employee Salikram Chaudhary of Base Nepal, Salyan.
Meanwhile, officials of several NGOs here have started meeting with the Maoists to solve the crisis, a source said. Of the 300 or more NGOs registered in the district, only around 15 are operational.

Excerpt from report by Younten Dorji in English by Bhutanese official newspaper Kuensel website on 9 January
The National Assembly resolved that the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should hold more bilateral talks with the Indian government and try to secure new trade routes to Bangladesh via Assam from Samdrup Jongkhar and explore more markets for the Bhutanese potato and orange exporters.
The decision was reached after the public of Nubugang geog [village group] under Pemagatsel Dzongkhag [district] submitted that the primary source of annual cash income for the people in the eastern region was generated through the sale of orange and potato to Assam, and given the substantial difference in the rates between Assam and Bangladesh, the government could alleviate poverty by opening more trade routes.
The public of Sarpang Dzongkhag also submitted that it was risky for farmers who export apple, orange and other cash crops to trade with only one country, and therefore the need to secure more markets with other countries.
The Sarpang chimi [representative] said that such market-oriented difficulties deterred farmers from exporting, and thus created a monopoly in the business.
In response the trade minister, Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba, said that the trade route from eastern Bhutan to Bangladesh via Assam, Meghalaya to Dawki on Meghalaya-Bangladesh border was being surveyed by the Ministry of Trade and Industries and that the negotiations on additional trade routes were under way.
The trade minister also reminded the house that the country was a member of BIMSTEC [Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, grouping Bangladesh, India, Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal], SAFTA [South Asia Free Trade Area] and was also trying to join WTO and that the negotiations were going well. [passage omitted]
The Agriculture Marketing Services had been exploring exports markets in Sri Lanka and Thailand but due to the high cost of transportation and highly competitive exporters within the region (New Zealand, Australia) it had been difficult to capture export markets. [passage omitted]

 The New Delhi statement said the plane carrying equipment for the Nepal police left Bulgaria on Tuesday, landed in India on Wednesday and was cleared to leave for Nepal, according to agency reports. However, the Indian daily The Hindu reported that the plane was detained at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, since Saturday before it was allowed to fly to Nepal.

Text of report by Radio Nepal on 26 November; all times local
A Maoist was killed and seven arrested in a security operation in Katunje, Udaypur today. 
A half-hour clash occurred in the Lamidanda forest when Maoists attacked a security patrol at about 9.00 a.m. in the morning, according to our correspondent, who quoted the 18th Brigade of the Royal Nepalese Army based in Udaypur.
The Royal Nepalese Army said that terrorists have been closing down schools, carrying out extortion and terrorizing people in spite of their unilateral truce announcement. According to the Far Western Division Headquarters of the army, terrorists threatened schools in Raya, Bajhang, to close down on Mangsir 8 [23 November]. When they found out that the schools were still open, they took the teachers and students to an unknown destination, only to free them at 5.00 p.m. 
Similarly teachers, students and common people of Doti, Darchula and Baitadi Districts were forced to go to their district headquarters on Mangsir 7 and 8. They were threatened with fatal consequences if they did not follow their orders, army said.
Meanwhile, a so-called area member named Harka Bahadur Gandarbha was arrested in a security operation in Gajada of Bajura yesterday. Socket bombs, terrorist documents and a large haul of foodgrain were also seized. The security forces reached the site after being informed about people forced out of their homes and being taken for the Maoist campaign. Other terrorists are reported to have fled the scene during the course of the operation.

"856",20031483,"Title: Death toll climbs past 1,450 in unrelenting cold wave in South Asia.rtf; Date: January 17, 2003 Friday; Text: At least another 79 people have died from a cold wave that has claimed more than 1,450 lives continued to grip South Asia, sending temperatures in several north Indian cities plunging to their lowest levels in decades, officials said Friday.
In Bangladesh, 23 more people died overnight, pushing the toll in the country to over 700, newspaper reports said Friday.
After a slight increase in temperatures on Wednesday, the mercury fell Thursday to 9.7 degrees Celsius (49.5 degrees Fahrenheit) in Dhaka, the lowest recorded in the capital this season.
Meteorologists said temperatures were unlikely to change in the next few days.
Many rural areas of the subcontinent are ill-prepared for cold weather, as much of the year is hot and sticky.
The cold spell has badly affected agriculture in Bangladesh, with planted saplings yellowing from the lack of sunlight and stored seeds attacked by insects drawn by the damp weather.
The country has also been hit by a dense fog, blamed largely on heavy air pollution, which has disrupted transportation.
Meanwhile the authorities in the impoverished eastern Indian state of Bihar invoked a law banning the gathering of more than five people after federally-run schools ignored its earlier notices and refused to shut down.
The rare step was taken after reports that six schoolchildren had fallen ill due to the cold.
""The administration used prohibitory orders to close the schools till January 20 in the wake of reports of students falling ill in the schools of cold,"" district magistrate Deepak Prasad said.
The education officer has been asked to probe the reports of students illness during school hours, he said.
The media reported another 39 deaths in the state, taking the toll in the state to 582 and across northern India to 682.
The condition deteriorated Friday as the minimum temperature dipped to a record low, weather officials said.
""The late noon sun has made the maximum temperature rise up to 16 degree Celsius but the minimum temperature plummeted to a lowest of 1.9 degree Celsius in Gaya district,"" the director of the state Meteorological department, R.K. Mukopadhyay, said.
Gaya town and the adjoining Bodhgaya, which is hosting a Buddhist festival being attended by Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama, continued to be the coldest, with icy winds whipping of the Himalayas.
Official figures, however, maintain 11 persons have died of cold.
Weather officials said the cold wave would continue at least until the end of the weekend and perhaps until month's end.
The mercury plummeted to freezing point in Kanpur city in Uttar Pradesh state. The 0.6 degree celcius temperature recorded on Friday is the lowest in four decades, local metrological office said.
The main city of Calcutta in the eastern state of West Bengal recorded 9.4 degrees celsius earlier this week, making it the coldest day in 11 years.
Most parts of northern India continued to reel under intense fog, reducing visibility to near zero and severely disrupting road, rail and air traffic in New Delhi.
In Nepal, 17 more people died, pushing the death toll to 80 since the beginning of the month, reports said Friday.
Many schools in Kathmandu are closed because of the cold conditions, which began this month. In the worst-affected lowland Terai area, 90 percent of schools have been shut until the weather warms up.
In the Terai, the temperature on Thursday and Friday fell to minus two degrees Celsius (28.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

"266",20032615,"Title: Police tighten dragnet around Kathmandu after police chief slain.rtf; Date: January 28, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Police and soldiers Tuesday tightened their dragnet around Kathmandu, setting up roadblocks, patrolling streets, searching homeless shelters and rounding up dozens of people in their hunt for the assassins of the nation's police chief.
Security for police and army officials has been stepped up following Sunday's slaying of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, his wife and his bodyguard while on an early-morning walk in a Kathmandu suburb, an army official told AFP.
""The Maoists had been threatening the lives of army and police officers, and the killing of Shrestha has proved the threat to be real,"" he said. ""So we have taken extra precautions for the officials.""
High-profile security personnel have been warned, he added, to remain at home at night and not to move in public without their bodyguards.
A police spokesman said four people had been arrested in connection with Sunday's brazen attack while some 25 to 30 others were being questioned.
Shrestha was killed by suspected Maoist rebels, including a woman, who were dressed in black and fled the scene after the shooting, according to media reports.
One suspect was under police guard at a hospital where he was being treated for a gunshot wound to the leg sustained in the attack, police said.
Media reports Tuesday said the wounded suspect, Krishna Hari Sainju, had confessed to being a Maoist commander and that his group had been plotting Shrestha's killing for more than a month.
Police declined to confirm the report, saying investigations were continuing and that they were still awaiting forensic proof linking the four to the killing.
""We have established that they are associated with the Maoists and we are now trying to substantiate whether they were involved in the killing,"" a police investigator said.
He added that the streets of Kathmandu and outlying areas were being scoured for others linked to the assassination, with the security forces setting up roadblocks and searching cars, while also subjecting pedestrians to rigorous bag searches and identity card checks.
Those taking refuge at night in the scores of homeless shelters in Kathmandu were also being searched and questioned, he said.
Shrestha and his schoolteacher wife, Nudu, were cremated Monday on the banks of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu before one of the largest crowds ever to attend such an event. Among them were Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Shrestha's two orphaned daughters.
Slain bodyguard Surya Regmi Shrestha was cremated in his native village.
Shrestha was the first head of the 15,000-strong Armed Police Force which was created to fight the rebels in 2001, shortly before the army was first deployed against them.
Pressure has been mounting on Home Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa to resign over the assassination, with three ministers calling on him to quit.
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP or National Democratic Party) of Prime Minister Chand late Monday joined the chorus, saying in a statement Thapa should take responsibility for this ""serious error"" and resign.
However, Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Kuber Sharma dismissed the idea that the minister would step down.
""No cabinet member should resign following the terrorist assaults,"" Sharma told reporters, adding that the entire government should take responsibility for the ""lax security"".
Sharma on Monday said the killings would not affect moves to broker a truce with the Maoists, who have been fighting a ""people's war"" in the Himalayan country for almost seven years, the insurgency claiming more than 7,800 lives, according to army figures.
He warned, however, that if the Maoists did not show a willingness to hold talks, the government would respond with a ""bullet-for-bullet"" policy.

"5297",20065514,"Title: Nepal peace talks edge onward but communists unwilling to reject arms.rtf; Date: October 10, 2006 Tuesday 2:04 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's governing parties and communist rebels agreed Tuesday to form a committee charged with breaking through blocked peace talks aimed at ending a decade of strife, even as the sides stuck close to their demands.
The committee, comprising both government and Maoist rebel negotiators and representatives from the seven-party ruling alliance, would try to forge an interim constitution while suggesting solutions on the sticky issue of the guerrillas' weapons.
Commerce Minister Hridesh Tripathi said the panel was charged with presenting a draft interim constitution acceptable to both sides by Thursday, when Prime Minister Girja Prasad Koirala is scheduled to meet with leaders of the seven-party ruling alliance and top rebels.
""We hope to resolve all the political issues based on suggestions by this committee,"" said Tripathi. Rebel spokesman Krishna Mahara said talks would continue, but said the committee didn't represent a breakthrough in the stymied peace parley.
The peace process, aimed at ending a 10-year insurgency, had been stalled for four months on the issue of weapons management. In June, the political parties and rebels agreed that the communists should be allowed to join an interim government in return for surrendering their arms, but no progress has been made on either front.
The government and rebels traded blame Tuesday for the impasse.
""If the two sides are able to make headway on the issue of the rebels' weapons, most of the political differences can easily be resolved,"" said Ramesh Lekhak, labor minister and a government negotiator.
""We want the Maoists to transform themselves into a democratic and legitimate force by giving up their arms-based politics. We can reach an understanding on every issue if they assure us that weapons are not used for political purposes,"" said Mahesh Acharya from the Nepali Congress, the Himalayan nation's largest party.
""We suspect the government is backing away from its previous flexibility and appears more rigid on the issue of arms management. They are trying to force us to surrender arms in the pretext of separating them from our fighters, which is unacceptable to us,"" said Dev Gurung, a member of the rebel team.
More than 13,000 people have died in the communist insurgency since it began in 1996.
The government and rebels declared a cease-fire and began peace talks in April. At their last meeting June 15, it was agreed that an interim constitution would be put in place within a month, and that the rebels would join the interim government. Neither pledge has been followed through.
Instead, the two sides have exchanged accusations of cease-fire violations, and the rebels have threatened to launch anti-government protests.

"7126",20082307,"Title: Violence in Tibet as Monks Clash With the Police.rtf; Date: March 15, 2008 Saturday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Violence erupted Friday morning in a busy market area of the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, as Buddhist monks and other ethnic Tibetans brawled with Chinese security forces in bloody clashes.  Witnesses said angry Tibetan crowds burned shops, cars, military vehicles and at least one tourist bus.  State media said at least 10 people died.   
  The chaotic scene was the latest, and most violent, confrontation in a series of protests that began on Monday and now represent a major challenge to the ruling Communist Party as it prepares to play host to the Olympic Games in August. By Saturday morning, Chinese armored vehicles were reportedly patrolling the center of the city.
  Beijing is facing the most serious and prolonged demonstrations in Tibet since the late 1980s, when it suppressed a rebellion there with lethal force that left scores, and possibly hundreds, of ethnic Tibetans dead. The leadership is clearly alarmed that a wave of negative publicity could disrupt its elaborate plans for the Olympics and its hopes that the games will showcase its rising influence and prosperity rather than domestic turmoil.
  Thousands of Buddhists in neighboring India and Nepal took to the streets Friday in solidarity. Concerned that the protests might spread elsewhere in China, the authorities appeared to be moving the military police into other regions with large Tibetan populations.
  Roughly 1,000 special police officers were deployed in the town of Bamei, in Sichuan Province, the site of a temple sacred to Tibetans, witnesses said by telephone on Friday. Residents in Lhasa, reached by telephone, said the authorities had placed much of the city under a curfew by Friday night while military police officers were blocking many city streets. One resident reported seeing armored vehicles in the center of the city.
  The United States Embassy in Beijing warned American citizens on Friday not to travel to Lhasa. The embassy said it had ''received firsthand reports from American citizens in the city who report gunfire and other indications of violence.''
  In a meeting in Beijing on Friday, the United States ambassador to China, Clark Randt, urged Chinese officials to act with restraint, ''and not resort to use of force in dealing with the protesters,'' the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, told reporters.
  The Chinese authorities blamed the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, for the violence and said the government would maintain stability in Lhasa. ''The government of Tibet Autonomous Region said Friday there had been enough evidence to prove that the recent sabotage was 'organized, premeditated and masterminded' by the Dalai clique,'' reported Xinhua, the Chinese government's official news agency. 
  The Dalai Lama released a statement on Friday calling on both sides to avoid violence and appealing to China's leaders to ''address the long simmering resentment of the Tibetan people through dialogue with the Tibetan people.'' A spokesman for the Dalai Lama called China's accusations ''absolutely baseless.''
  The situation in Lhasa represents a complicated predicament for the Communist Party, which is now holding its annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing. Party leaders are already grappling with growing criticism of China's domestic human rights record and its ties to Sudan, which the United States has accused of waging a genocidal campaign in its Darfur region. 
  In the past China has not hesitated to crush major protests in Tibet or to jail disobedient monks. President Hu Jintao, who is also the general secretary of the Communist Party, served as party boss in Tibet during a violent crackdown in 1989. His support for the bloody suppression of unrest that year earned him the good will of Deng Xiaoping, then the paramount leader, and led directly to his elevation to the Politburo Standing Committee and eventually to China's top leadership posts.
  But Chinese leaders may be more reluctant to order such heavy-handed tactics as Beijing prepares for the Olympics. On Friday, different accounts emerged about how the Chinese military police in Lhasa handled the demonstrations.
  Radio Free Asia, a nonprofit news agency financed by the United States government, quoted Tibetan witnesses who described police officers firing into crowds of protesters and killing at least two people in the city's ancient Barkhor area. On Saturday morning, Radio Free Asia quoted witnesses who described seeing dead bodies around Lhasa. 
  Later on Saturday  Xinhua  reported  10 deaths had been confirmed. 
  A Chinese resident in Lhasa, reached by telephone, said stories were circulating among local Chinese that soldiers had been wounded and had not been allowed to fight back against Tibetans throwing rocks. Another Chinese man living near the Barkhor area said family members had told him that two soldiers died and that Tibetans were beating Chinese residents with iron rods.

"3643",20054173,"Title: Fewer new land mine victims last year around world, report says.rtf; Date: November 22, 2005, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: The number of reported land mine casualties worldwide declined for the sixth year in a row, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in a report Tuesday.
At least 6,521 people were killed or maimed by land mine blasts last year, compared with 8,065 in 2003, the group said in the annual report, which was released during a conference in Medellin, Colombia's second-biggest city, to discuss improving global assistance to victims.
Actual casualty figures could be as high as 20,000 since many cases go unreported, said Kathleen Maes of Handicap International, a victims' group that helped produce the report.
The majority of casualties were civilians, and one-fifth were children, the report said.
It identified nearly 250,000 land mine blast survivors in 121 countries, and said that ""medical care, rehabilitation and socio-economic reintegration services remain either inadequate or unavailable in too many countries.""
Fewer casualties were recorded in 2004 in some of the countries most affected by land mines, including Afghanistan, Angola and Sri Lanka, the report said. But several countries saw an increase in new mine victims last year, notably Colombia and Cambodia.
""The situation is especially worrying in Colombia,"" where the number of victims has nearly quadrupled in the past three years, Maes told The Associated Press.
Colombian military officials say leftist rebels who have battling since the 1960s to establish a Marxist-style state have resorted to the widespread use of mines in an attempt to slow a government offensive. Colombia has reported that land mines now cause one-third of military casualties.
The report singled out Russia, Myanmar and Nepal as the only governments that laid anti-personnel mines this year.

AP Enterprise: Thousands of children missing in Latin America each year due to poverty, corruption, weak laws
MEXICO CITY - It was a grisly discovery: the two boys had been disfigured by gashes, bruises, welts and burns. Their lifeless bodies were then bent into fetal positions, stuffed inside cardboard boxes and dumped in a dirty, vacant lot. The victims, 8 and 110, were the targets of a small band of criminals who had spent the past 15 years abducting young Mexican boys, then selling them in the United States for illegal adoptions. That's only part of the problem of the disappearances of children - and their kidnapping and trafficking - which is rampant throughout Latin America. BC-LA-FEA-GEN--Latam-Missing Children. By Lisa J.

Powerful Turkish fellowship threads careful path with leader across the Atlantic
ISTANBUL, Turkey - There doesn't seem to be much separating the politics of secular Turkey's leaders and an Islamic-oriented movement built around a preacher, author and mystic scholar named Fethullah Gulen. Both promote Western-style enterprise and education. They denounce Muslim radicals and agree on Turkey's main goal: European Union membership. So why has Gulen moved into self-exile in the United States after facing charges of seeking an Islamic-style regime in his homeland? BC-EU-FEA-REL--Turkey-Religious Leader. By Brian Murphy.

LA CLUSAZ, France - Tucked away in high hidden Alpine valleys of France's Haute-Savoie region are small, medieval villages with ancient church spires and stunning ski slopes, where the runs are open from the first winter snows until mountain flowers begin to poke up in late spring. La Clusaz, an 11th century village nestled in the soft folds of the Aravis Valley with its one main street, no stop lights and a bell that rings to remind you every hour that you are relaxed and happy, is one of them.

Former British spy chief-turned-novelist considers the challenge today's spies face in the war on terror
LONDON - Stella Rimington, who directed Britain's MI5 spy agency during a high point of IRA terrorism in the 1990s, has never liked the way that James Bond movies portray secret agents. As far as she's concerned, John le Carre's spy novels were much more realistic in their portrayal of international espionage during the Cold War.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 13 June
 Pokhara [western Nepal], 12 June: Maoists have shot dead senior educationist Ganesh Man Palikhe at a busy highway on Sunday [12 June]. Palikhe's two bodyguards also died in the incident.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13 Jun 05, p1
Palikhe was involved in the teaching profession for four decades. He was the principal of Janapriya Multiple Campus, national president of Nepal Public Campus Association and a member of the Tribhuvan University Council.
 He was attacked by Maoists at 5:10 p.m. on Sunday [12 June] on the busy highway in front of his house at Nagdhunga of Pokhara Metropolis. He was returning home from the campus. Eyewitnesses said Maoists opened fire right as Palikhe and his two bodyguards alighted from their vehicle.
 Palikhe was rushed to hospital where the doctors declared him dead. His two bodyguards - police constable Chun Bahadur Kumal and policeman Sujan Rai - died during treatment. [Passage omitted: Eyewitness account of the incident]
 On 8 March, students of All Nepal National Independent Students' Union (Revolutionary) [ANNISU-R] [student wing of the Maoists] had tried to burn Palikhe alive in his office. Then the district administration appointed two bodyguards for him. Palikhe defended himself when the students tried to set him on fire after sprinkling petrol on him. Students and teachers of the campus had caught an ANNISU-R cadre and handed him over to police. The Maoists then issued threats against him. [Passage omitted]

Judge Dilip Kumar Poudel issued a statement saying the Royal Commission for Corruption Control has one week to explain why it convicted Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and jailed him for two years, and to prove the decision was legitimate.
King Gyanendra set up the commission after he fired the elected government of Nepal, a constitutional monarchy, and set up his own Cabinet earlier this year. He claimed the takeover was necessary to quell an anti-monarchist communist insurgency and fight corruption.
The Supreme Court sought the commission's explanation of the conviction after the court began to review an appeal, filed by Deuba.
The commission convicted Deuba in July of misusing 370 million rupees (US$5.3 million; [euro]4.4 million) in awarding a contract related to a road-building project.
The project had already been awarded to a contractor, but the commission ruled that Deuba's government had reassigned it to a different one - which had been a big contributor to Deuba's party - for more than twice the original amount.
The commission sentenced Deuba to two years in jail and fined him 90 million rupees (US$1.2 million; [euro]990,000). The investigation and trial lasted three months.
Deuba claimed the commission was illegal and refused to answer all questions during the investigation and trial.
Opposition politicians say the commission is a tool to weed out opposition to the king's direct rule.

The main purpose of their trip is to attend the Hindu festival of Koti Home (""Sacred Fire"") at Kanchikamakoti Pith in southern India.
""The king is scheduled to meet both President Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Thursday or Friday (in New Delhi) before proceeding to Madras in southern India on Friday to begin his unofficial pilgrimage tour,"" a royal palace source said Wednesday.
Gyanendra is expected to discuss social and economical cooperation between Nepal and its giant neighbour.
Former foreign minister and former ambassador to India Chakra Prasad Banstola said he hoped the visit would help strengthen bilateral relations.
""The visit of the king will help to seek further cooperation of India to solve the Maoist problem in Nepal,"" Banstola said.
The Nepali government and Maoist rebels, who have been waging a seven-year insurgency, declared a ceasefire in January and said they will hold peace talks, though no date has been set.
It is Gyanendra's second trip to India since he ascended the throne of the world's only Hindu kingdom in June 2001.
Gyanendra became king after his brother King Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were gunned down at their palace.
The massacre was carried out by crown prince Dipendra, who turned the gun on himself. An official report said Dipendra was drunk and furious his parents had rejected his desired fiancee.

"4335",20062066,"Title: Lebanon truce put to test as Annan blames Israel.rtf; Date: August 20, 2006 Sunday 8:27 AM GMT; Text: An uneasy truce to end 34 days of war in Lebanon faced its biggest test Sunday after an Israeli commando raid against Hezbollah which UN chief Kofi Annan said was a violation of the ceasefire deal.
Israel insisted it would not hesitate to carry out more raids to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to Hezbollah and Syria, but Lebanon warned it could stop its troop deployment in the south of the country.
In the first serious violence since the UN-brokered ceasefire came into last Monday, Israel on Saturday airlifted troops into a Hezbollah stronghold in the Baalbek region of eastern Lebanon and clashed with Shiite Muslim fighters.
Annan voiced his concern at the raid, which has underscored the fragility of the truce accord as the United Nations struggles to put together a beefed-up peacekeeping force in war-battered south Lebanon.
""The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about a violation by the Israeli side of the cessation of hostilities as laid out in Security Council resolution 1701,"" a statement issued by Annan's spokesman said.
""The Secretary-General further calls on all parties to respect strictly the arms embargo, exercise maximum restraint, avoid provocative actions and display responsibility in implementing resolution 1701.""
A visiting UN envoy in Lebanon warned that such incidents threatened to spark war again and scare off states which may help boost the UN peacekeeping force.
""We may slip into war again, this is why incidents such as what happened yesterday are not very helpful,"" Terje Roed-Larsen was quoted as saying in Lebanon's leading Arabic-language An-Nahar newspaper.
""The incident does not help maintain the fragile ceasefire and will not encourage potential participants in the new international force to contribute with soldiers.""
Resolution 1701 calls for Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the Lebanese army and a strengthened UN force of 15,000 troops.
The United Nations has been urging countries, particularly European nations, to send troops, but most governments want more details on the precise mandate of the force before contributing.
Israel said Saturday's raid was aimed at halting weapons smuggling and accused Lebanon of violating the truce by failing to station troops on the border with Syria.
""As long as the Lebanese army and the international forces are not deployed, the Israeli army will not stop its flights in the region to stop the transfers of arms from Syria,"" Environmental Minister Gideon Ezra, who is considered close to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, told public radio.
Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora blasted Saturday's operation as a ""blatant violation"" of the truce, which took effect on Monday to end a conflict that has claimed close to 1,300 lives in Lebanon and killed 160 Israelis.
Lebanon warned it might suspend its troop deployment to Hezbollah's stronghold in the south, which began on Thursday, if the United Nations failed to ensure Israel honoured the resolution.
""I could ask the cabinet to stop the army's deployment to the south, as we did not send the troops to fall into an Israeli trap,"" Defence Minister Elias Murr said.
A Lebanese military official said Israeli commandos were dropped in by helicopters in the mountainous region of Afqa, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Baalbek, in the central Bekaa valley, at dawn Saturday.
Commandos then drove eastwards to the nearby village of Buday where they clashed with Hezbollah guerrillas, he said.
Israeli public radio said the mission might have been to free the two Israeli soldiers seized by Hezbollah on July 12, or at least to obtain information about them.
Their capture triggered Israel's massive offensive against Lebanon, the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century.
The Lebanese government announced Sunday cash donations to the victims of Israel's devastating offensive and their families of between 6,650 dollars and 13,350 dollars each.
Six civilians have killed since the truce took effect. There were also exchanges of fire last week that left at least four Hezbollah fighters dead, but both sides downplayed the clashes.
The Israeli raid came hours before French troops began deploying in Lebanon and as EU leaders hesitated to offer firm troop commitments in the absence of details on the precise mandate of the force.
France is contributing 200 troops, far short of the major commanding role many had foreseen for Lebanon's former colonial power, and an Israeli foreign ministry official said there was ""astonishment"" at the low numbers.
About 50 French soldiers from an engineering unit arrived Saturday and another 150 left France on Sunday.
""It's very important that Europe now steps forward,"" Deputy UN Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown said Friday, emphasizing that 3,500 troops were needed on the ground within 10 days.
He said that while Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal had all offered troops, there was a need to d"

  But even as the Maoists ended their siege of Kathmandu and other towns after an appeal from the country's seven main political parties, they endorsed a new series of protests planned for early next month. 
  The rebels and the parties also reaffirmed their 'strong commitment' on March 19 to a deal they struck last November to work together against King Gyanendra, who seized power last year.
  The blockade had choked supplies since March 14, raising prices of essential goods, causing fuel shortages and leaving thousands stranded across the nation that is wedged between China and India.
 ""There was a shortage due to blockade but now everything is ok. We are getting the regular supply of diesel and petrol and there's absolutely no problem,"" a petrol pump owner, Suman Bhattarai said. 
  Tourists who were stranded in India were also happy to return to Kathmandu as the transport service resumed.
  ""Kathmandu was off limits and the border had been blocked. We were facing a lot of problems. Altogether we were 300 people. Now we are happy that the blockade has been called off and we can move freely,"" a tourist returning to Kathmandu via Rupendehi, Sumbhapati said.
  Maoists had mainly enforced the blockade by threatening reprisals against anyone who broke it. They also set up some roadblocks and sporadically attacked vehicles.
  The rebels also called off a general strike planned for April 3. But they endorsed a strike and series of protests called by political parties beginning on April 6, in what analysts interpreted as a reaffirmation of their loose alliance.
  The alliance had run into trouble in recent months, with political parties alleging the rebels had continued to kidnap, extort and kill civilians. The Maoists had criticised the parties for not being able to mount sustained mass protests against the king.
  In November, Maoists also promised to rejoin the political mainstream in return for a promise by political parties to hold elections to an assembly that would draw up a new constitution to decide on the role of the monarchy, a key rebel demand.
  The Maoists began fighting in 1996 to topple the Hindu monarchy and set up a communist republic. 
  Nepal has been in turmoil since the king took power last year, saying his move was necessary to quell the ten-year revolt that has killed more than 13,000 people and shattered an economy dependent on aid and tourism. 
  The rebels last called a ceasefire in September but called it off in January after the government refused to follow suit.

Both of Thursday's bombs hit three-wheeled vehicles used for transporting people that were parked at stands in central Kathmandu.

 In a third case, an alert driver picked up and threw out the window a crude bomb left behind by a passenger in a microbus. That bomb failed to explode.

The meeting was drawing together health, agriculture and livestock officials from the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, a government statement said.
Representatives of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization also were expected to attend the daylong discussions.
About 80 million chickens have been slaughtered across Asia, excluding China, to curb the spread of bird flu, which has killed 14 people in Vietnam and six in Thailand. Although there have been no reports of bird flu in South Asia, there have been rising concerns about it spreading to the region.
Most countries in the South Asian grouping - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives - have banned the import of poultry and meat products from several Asian countries.
""The meeting will deliberate on possible cooperation for tackling the problem of avian influenza or bird flu which has emerged in some Asian countries,"" said a statement issued by India's ministry of external affairs.
The meeting was called after the WHO said bird flu could have a more devastating impact on Asia than last year's SARS outbreak, the statement said.
Although no cases of bird flu have been reported in India, prices of chicken have plunged by one-third in New Delhi and several other areas because of panic.
India's poultry industry was losing more than 100 million rupees (US$2.2 million) every day due to a fall in demand for chicken and eggs, the Hindu Business Line newspaper reported Monday.

 Tehran, 15 February: Deputy Foreign Minister for education and research affairs Ali Reza Mo'ayyeri said here on Sunday 15 February that regional peace and stability can only be materialized through cooperation and mutual understanding among countries.
 He added that to attain such an objective, various potentials in the region should be used.
 Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the second International Indian Ocean Region (IOR) Conference held at the Foreign Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies, he further noted: ""Indian Ocean is located in a sensitive and geopolitical region, which has long been appealing to world powerful countries.
IRNA news agency, Tehran, in English 1221 gmt 15 Feb 04
""The region has been the scene of rivalry between the Americans and the ex-Soviet Union during the Cold War era to access its diverse resources and advantages,"" he said.
 Turning to the region's major oil and gas resources as well as its transportation facilities, human resources and other privileges, he noted that despite its high potential, they have not yet been used to the optimum.
 ""Some 75 per cent of the world's total oil reserves lie in the Indian Ocean and if the Caspian resources are added to them, the high significance of the region will be revealed.
 ""However, though the Indian Ocean region houses almost a quarter of the world's population, its available economic opportunities have not yet been used properly,"" he added.
 Referring to the fact that disarmament is the main objective for promotion of security and peace in the world, he reiterated the belief that the Middle East should be converted into a region free from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and that Iran has always been in favour of annihilating nuclear arms there.
 Pointing to terrorism as a global issue, he reiterated the need for campaign against it by all world states, with the exception of one country which cannot have any claim to such a campaign.
 ""After the 11 September terrorist event as well as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Americans' approach towards the Middle East and Indian Ocean regions changed into one of security concern and the US military presence there has made the conditions still more complicated,"" he added.
 Mo'ayyeri referred to the proposal on establishment of a tripartite gas pipeline by Iran, Pakistan and India as one way for economic cooperation among the three neighbouring states which could be greatly profitable.
 The second two-day International IOR Conference entitled ""Security, Energy and IOR"" which opened at the Foreign Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies on Sunday is attended by experts and professors from Australia, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Canada, South Africa and Nepal.
 ""Perspective of Security in the IOR"", ""Concept of Energy Security in IOR"", ""Extra-regional Powers in IOR"", ""Gas Transmission Pipelines in IOR"", ""Environmental Security in IOR"" and ""Regional and Extra-regional Cooperation in IOR"" are among the focal points on the agenda of the two-day meeting.

Excerpt from report by privately-owned Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 27 November
[Report by Ram Krishna Gyawali] 
Pokhara: [Wednesday] 26 November: CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary Jhala Nath Khanal says no matter how revolutionary and strident some among the Maoists might sound, they are not in any position to resort once again to armed insurrection. He said categorically that they are no longer able to return to the jungle.
Inaugurating a gathering of party workers in Pokhara on Wednesday, general secretary Khanal said the Maoists are now no longer as capable of taking to the jungles with arms.
""The Maoists cannot return by the same hole out of which they came,"" he said, ""Even the ultra-revolutionary Maoists cannot turn back to the jungle.""
Khanal's comment comes at a time when a debate is under way among the Maoists on pressing for a people's republic.
Stating that state restructuring is the big challenge now, general secretary Khanal said the federal model for Nepal should not be like that of other countries but should be something in a Nepalese style. Indicating the model just disclosed by one of the ministers in the government, he said when going for federalism the main challenge is what kind of federalism to choose.
Disclosing that a high-level land reform commission would be constituted in a few days, he said the land reforms to come will be of the 21st century.
At a time when feudalism in Nepal has weakened, the same old thinking will not inform the land reform programme, he said, adding that land reforms in the 21st century will be of a different sort.
Addressing the party workers' gathering held in the context of the CPN-UML's eighth general convention, general secretary Khanal urged the party workers to strengthen the party organization, bearing in mind the jolt it received during the elections. Success will come easily if the party moves ahead, learning from past mistakes and weaknesses, he said.
Claiming the party will go to its general convention as one solid block, he said the past had taught what the fruits of division are. [passage omitted]

Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 9 August: The CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary, Madhav Kumar Nepal, who met CPN-Maoist supremo Prachanda and others earlier on Tuesday morning, reassured the party that the peace process has not derailed altogether ""given the normalization in the relations very soon"".

 Excerpt from report by Milan Mani Sharma, published by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 11 July
 Kathmandu, 10 July: With an aim to reduce export dependency on India and diversify export markets, the government is all set to formally approach China for duty free market access and other trade facilities to Nepali exports to China, including the Autonomous Region of Tibet.
 ""A formal discussion on the issues will be held shortly with the government and officials concerned at the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu,"" said a government source, further stating that it is expected to pave ways for talks at the appropriate level, including political level.
 This is regarded as a major breakthrough, as the concerned traders and experts had long been urging the government to seek tariff concessions from China to provide impetus to Nepal's trade with its northern neighbour.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 11 Jul 03
To date, the issue was discussed at informal level only. ""Nonetheless, China has been maintaining a positive tone on the matter,"" said the source. A Chinese embassy official concerned with the initiative, while talking to The Kathmandu Post recently, also expressed similar views.
 ""China is ready to enter into a new arrangement to boost trade with Nepal. But it can be worked out only when Nepal formally approaches the concerned Chinese authorities for discussing the issues at the appropriate level,"" said Qiang He, third secretary, economic and commercial office, Chinese embassy.
 China has been liberal to promote bilateral trade of late. Apart from the existing four functional trade points, China is for opening four more customs checkpoints with Nepal. In addition, the northern neighbour has also shown eagerness in developing necessary infrastructures to link the two countries.
 The government official also expressed optimism that China would pledge zero tariff facility to maintain strategic balance, as Nepal has been enjoying similar trade arrangement with India.
 Nepal has bilateral trade agreement with China since 1981. The treaty is being automatically renewed every three years with no proposal for reviewing coming from either governments. In fact, the two governments have never sat down together and assessed its impacts since the time of signing the bilateral treaty.
 However, Nepal has been short in registering significant trade with China while inflow of Chinese goods has soared drastically over the years, to the effect that Nepal has experienced a trade deficit of over 8bn rupees with China in 2002 alone.
 ""With China providing duty-free market access, Nepali products would capture Tibetan and other markets in China, thereby helping reduce the widening trade gap,"" said Pradeep Kumar Shrestha, former president of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).  passage omitted

At a meeting with President Joseph Kabila, the heads of the militias operating in Ituri promised to help facilitate the UN peacekeepers' mission in the district, Petronille Waweka, who chairs Ituri's interim assembly, said in a statement.
The pledge came as heads of Ituri militias met in Kinshasa to discuss peace in the troubled province -- where ethnic clashes have claimed 50,000 lives and displaced half a million people since 1999 -- as part of the overall peace process in the DRC.
A UN peace mission, known as MONUC 2, will take over on September 1 from the UN-mandated, French-led EU mission that has been stationed since June in Bunia, the regional capital of Ituri.
The militias also pledged their commitment to the success of a UN-trained police force to be deployed in Ituri, Waweka said.
MONUC plans to train 1,200 police officers by the end of the year to facilitate political transition in the country.
Some 2,000 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay and Bangladesh, are already in Bunia. A Pakistani and a Nepalese contingent will bring the total to 4,700 over the next few weeks.
The interim French-led MONUC 1 was confined to Bunia and was authorised to fire only in self defence, while MONUC 2 will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower, including attack helicopters.
MONUC 2 hopes that Bunia will be sufficiently stabilized so that it will be able to operate in the rest of the district.

[Presenter] The resident representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Nepal, Matthew Kahane, has said the country's army could be monitored and not supervised during the peace process. 
Kahane's comments come as the possibility of putting Royal Nepalese Army and Maoist arms under UN supervision is being debated following the conclusion of an agreement between the seven opposition parties and the Maoists.
[Kahane] In almost in all peace processes throughout the world when there is complete cessation of fighting, then there is some role for a third party, the UN. Not to supervise but to monitor to see that those who were fighting are no longer fighting. Monitoring disengagement, not supervising, yes that's a common practice, and there are very many officers in the Royal Nepalese Army who have worked and carried out precisely these roles in other countries around the world under the agreement of the United Nations. It's a role the RNA knows very well. 
[Presenter] Speaking after handing books to a public library in the capital today, he said the Royal Nepalese Army has great experience in monitoring weapons in other countries. Kahane also said the United Nations would not monitor municipal elections in February next year in line with its policy not to monitor local elections.

Two little-known ethnic groups, the Terai Army and the Nepal People's Army, claimed responsibility for the near-simultaneous explosions around Kathmandu on September 2.
""We have arrested four people for involvement in three blasts, one of whom is a police constable. They were arrested from different parts of Kathmandu,"" Upendra Kanta Aryal, a senior police officer told AFP.
""All of them have declared their affiliation with Terai Army but we don't know much about this group,"" he said.
Another nine people are being sought by police in connection with the attacks, Aryal said.
Nepal's former rebel Maoists condemned the attacks, saying they had been carried out to disrupt polls planned for November.
A decade of bloody civil war in the Himalayan nation ended late last year when the ultra-leftist Maoists signed a landmark peace deal with mainstream political parties.
But ethnic and communal unrest in the southern Terai region that has killed at least 120 people has cast a shadow over the peace deal.
Since the start of the year, at least a dozen small, armed ethnic groups have emerged. They claim to be fighting for greater autonomy for the fertile region along Nepal's southern border with India.
The people of the Terai, home to around half Nepal's 27 million-strong population, have long been underrepresented in Kathmandu, and the United Nations has warned the continued unrest endangers the holding of elections.

Text of report by Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao website on 23 October
[Article by Tan Wen-tien, a senior media person: ""The Dalai Lama is A Pawn of the United States""]
When I read the news about US President George W. Bush meeting the Dalai Lama at the White House on October 16, my immediate response was: Diplomatic or foreign affairs activities in the international arena should adhere to given norms, and even a superpower should pay attention to diplomatic ethics and good faith and should not play a double game and do as one pleases. Given that the United States has repeatedly reiterated that it upholds the one-China policy and has formed a strategic partnership with China, how can the US president meet with the Dalai Lama, the ""Tibet independence"" ringleader, in such a stately manner at the White House?
United States Pulling Strings from Behind
Even more shocking is that before meeting with the Dalai Lama and awarding him the ""Congressional Gold Medal"" (a gold medal of honour) at the US Congress, Bush actually said that he was meeting with the Dalai Lama and attending the ceremony in China's interest, saying that what he was about to do would not hurt US ties with China. As I see it, such position and logic are the ways of Martians, not the behaviours of people on this planet. This is like someone stabbing another person at the back and then say ""I'm doing this for his own good,"" as if nothing has happened. Are such justification and style not ""deceiving others as well as oneself""? Is this not ""shame-faced""? Is this not the hegemonic mentality of ""doing as I please""?
The Dalai Lama was the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism to start with, and our country respected and revered him in every possible way. He should have sincerely and properly served the Tibetan people and the country. To our dismay, he took part in and directed the rebellion in the 1960s and fled to India with his followers afterward, where he set up a government in exile. He also organized rebels to undergo military training in Nepal and accepted US military supplies and economic assistance. Rebel groups led by the Dalai Lama had repeatedly plotted to ""fight back to Tibet."" Of course these all ended in crushing defeat.
President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. Following the formal establishment of Sino-US diplomatic relations, it was no longer convenient for the United States to support the Dalai Lama militarily. However, it continued to give him economic assistance. The United States then changed its tactics by decking the Dalai Lama out as a ""religious leader,"" ""human rights fighter"" and ""peace-lover"" who preaches the Gandhi style of ""non-violence."" What is more, the United States even tried hard both openly and from behind the scenes to help the Dalai Lama win the ""Nobel Peace Prize."" The core of this tactics of the United States is to internationalize the so-called ""Tibet issue"" while making use of the Dalai Lama in ""anti-China"" plots and ""containing China"" from the western part of China. The Dalai Lama thus became a pawn of US and international ""hate-China and anti-China"" forces. Put in another way, the Dalai Lama is proud of being friendly with foreign countries and is happily playing the part of an ""international celebrity"" in the international community.
In the 1960s, the aim of all activities of the Dalai Lama was ""Tibet independence."" He was trying to build and rule the ""greater Tibet autonomous region"" (encompassing not only Tibet but also parts of neighbouring Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan) in a dictatorial model featuring ""the unification of the state and the church."" Of course this was just the wishful thinking of the Dalai Lama himself as well as that of his confidants. After the 1980s, the Dalai Lama and his spokesman repeatedly stated on open occasions that they were not after ""Tibet independence"" and were only seeking ""a high degree of autonomy."" Naturally this was only the ""hat-trick"" of the Dalai clique.
""Tibet Independence"" Nature Remains Unchanged
Actually, representatives of the Dalai Lama have been making contacts with the Central authorities and have gone to Beijing for negotiations behind closed doors on many occasions. However, since the ""Tibet independence"" nature of the Dalai clique remains unchanged, these efforts have come to naught. The Dalai Lama also refused to return to China because he failed to achieve ""Tibet independence."" In March 1997, the Dalai Lama visited Taiwan for the first time. ""Tibet independence"" and ""Taiwan independence"" flocked together like birds of the same feather. The Dalai Lama received huge ""donations"" in Taiwan and established a Taiwan-Tibet Exchange Fund there. He visited Taiwan again in January 2001. From this, we can see that no matter how appealing were his words, his ""independence"" nature remains unchanged. It is worth pointing out that Tibet already has a history of more than 40 years as an autonomous region and no longer ne"

Kathmandu, 14 April: The chief of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR] in Nepal, Lena Sundh, has drawn the attention of a Maoist minister saying that the Maoist behaviour in the villages has not changed even after the formation of an interim government.
Sundh told Minister for Local Development Dev Gurung, who had gone to meet the chief of UN Mission in Nepal, Ian Martin and UN arms monitors [on 14 April], that people in the villages are still afraid of the Maoists.
Sundh told Minister Gurung that the Maoists should act responsibly after joining the government, correct their behaviour and create an atmosphere free of fear.
Sundh informed Minster Gurung that Maoist people's governments and people's courts [vigilante courts] are still in operation in the villages though Maoist Chairman Prachanda has already announced that the people's governments and Maoists' people's courts [vigilante courts] have been scrapped.
She told Minister Gurung that the Maoist workers were continuously taking law into their hands under various excuses and asked the minister to immediately stop such activities.
Minister Gurung, in reply, told Sundh that the Maoist leadership had issued instructions to the party's grassroots not to do anything that could affect normal life. He also expressed commitment on behalf of the Maoist party that the Maoist party would do nothing that could affect the peace and security, according to a source.
The source said Martin and Gurung, during the meeting discussed the second phase of registration and verification of camped Maoist combatants.

"5118",2006396,"Title: Cooking gas shortage in Nepali capital.rtf; Date: January 14, 2006 Saturday 3:00 AM EST; Text: Shortage of cooking gas has hit  the Kathmandu Valley. The seasonal crisis, which hits consumers of the Valley every winter, deepened this week as supply from the  Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) went irregular.
    ""I have been queuing at my dealer for about two weeks and am  still not being provided with a cylinder of gas,""  a resident of  the Valley told reporters here on Saturday. 
    Geeta Ojha said that she has shifted back to kerosene stove  once again to cook food after her regular supplier, dealer of  Nepal Gas failed to supply her with the fuel.
    Officials at the Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), meanwhile, said  that the corporation was making sure that the adequate gas is  being brought in the country to normalize the situation. 
    ""We are seriously committed to maintain the supply and bring  the situation back to normalcy,"" acting chief of the NOC Umesh  Dahal said. NOC data shows that cooking gas in excess of 260 tons  was imported daily this week, he said. 
    However, senior officials of the gas companies said that the  volume of gas currently being imported was inadequate to address  the shortage, which was the result of short supply recorded during the last three months.
    Citing the cause of repair and maintenance of refinery, the IOC had curtailed the supply to 6,100 tons of gas during October to  December. The effective monthly demand of gas in the country is 6, 500 tons and during the winter season it goes up to 7,200 tons.
    ""Shortage of about 700 tons was already building pressure in  the market. Complete stall of raw supply for the first six days of January resulted in sudden explosion in the situation,"" said Saroj Pandey, president of Nepal Liquified Petroleum Gas Industries  Association, explaining the crisis.
    The supply was stalled during the period due mainly to holidays and breakdown of dispensary in Barauni refinery of IOC, he added.
    NOC records show that over 300 tons of gas entered the country  each day for three days last week and daily imports was recorded  at over 250 tons this week. 
    But, given the backlog and the increased outflow of cylinders  in the market, which happens during the crisis, volume of gas  being received was inadequate, he said.
    The association has stated that the NOC must ensure import of  over 400 tons of gas every day for next two weeks for the supply  to normalize.
    It has urged their dealers in the Valley to manage the crisis  by supplying the fuel in a queue by maintaining a demand register  and following it strictly by supplying the gas on first-come first- serve basis.

"6712",20083244,"Title: India stops recruiting Nepalese Gurkha soldiers - paper.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 16, 2008 Sunday
Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 16 November
[By Khim Ghale] 
Kathmandu, [Saturday] 15 November: Breaking an over 200-year-old tradition, India has stopped the recruitment of [Nepalese] Gurkha soldiers. 
Officials have said that the Gurkha recruitment centre in Gorakhpur [northern India] has not been operational for the past one year. The Gorakhpur recruitment centre used to enrol Gurkhas to serve in the Indian Army. 
""There is no formal announcement of the closure of the recruitment centre, but they have not enlisted our youth,"" said ex-Indian Gurkha serviceman Subedar Jas Bahadur Gurung in Pokhara. With the closure of the recruitment centre, our youth will not only lose employment, it will have a negative effect on the national economy as well, he said. 
Gurung said that he was trying to get the recruitment resumed. He said that an assurance to the effect had been given. 
""We are hopeful the halted recruitment will restart,"" Gurung said. 
Raising the issue of the halted recruitment of the Gurkha soldiers, legislator M.S. Thapa had sought information on the issue from the government in the parliament session on Friday. 
However, Indian ambassador to Nepal Rakesh Sood has said that recruitment has not stopped. The recruitment frequency has gone down just because there are fewer vacant posts available, he said. In a letter to legislator Thapa, Sood has clarified that the tripartite agreement [between Nepal, Indian and the UK] has not been amended. 
India started recruiting Gurkhas since the tripartite agreement was signed in 1947. Nepal's Gurkhas in the Indian Army have been deployed in wars with Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and India's Kargil [as published]. 
Legislator Thapa said that he came to know about the discontinuation of the recruitment after aspiring youths talked about the halted recruitment. If the recruitment has really stopped, thousands of Nepalese youth would lose employment, legislator M.S. Thapa complained. The government needs to come up with a clear view on this issue, he said. At a time of global recession, a good and secure and employment opportunity is being lost, Thapa said. Not only has the recruitment been halted, the medical facilities being provided to ex-servicemen and their families have also been stopped. This will have a negative impact on the lives of veterans who spent most of their lives in the Indian Army, he said. 
President of the Nepal Ex-Servicemen's Association Dipak Bahadur Gurung said that the recruitment was stopped following pressure from Indian regions with Nepali-speaking communities, such as Assam, Dehradun and Darjeeling, to recruit their youths into the army. 
Indian recruitment for Gurkhas had been giving reliable employment opportunities for youths from the western hills of Nepal. Around 250,000 Gurkhas have been receiving a pension from the Indian Army while about 60,000 are still serving. Three thousand youths were recruited last year alone. 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suresh Pradhan said he had no knowledge of the discontinuation of Gurkha recruitment by India. 
""No formal notification has been made so far on the issue,"" he said.

"5239",20065548,"Title: Nepal 's government, Maoist rebels take tentative steps to peace.rtf; Date: May 27, 2006 Saturday 2:01 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's government and communist rebels agreed to a 25-point code of conduct at peace talks to end a decade-long insurgency, solidifying a new bond between the two sides forged during demonstrations to oust King Gyanendra.
During their nearly six-hour meeting Friday, the two sides pledged to continue talks although they set no firm date for future discussions, Home Minister Krishna Situala and Maoist rebel spokesman Krishna Mahara said.
Even before the talks began, the government and rebels had agreed to elect a special assembly to rewrite the constitution a key rebel demand that had stymied earlier efforts to achieve peace.
""We agree on the main agenda that there should be election for constituent assembly and we will continue to work together to achieve this task,"" said Sitaula, head of the government's negotiating team.
Under the code of conduct, both sides agree to not provoke violence, will cease attacks and end military recruitment and fund-raising.
""The agreement on a code of conduct is the first step to achieve our goals. It has created an atmosphere of trust,"" Mahara said after the meeting at a golf club on the eastern edge of the capital, Katmandu.
No date has been set for next round of peace talks, but the two sides said it would take place soon.
Nepal's government took power after Gyanendra was forced out of office by weeks of protests organized largely by the politicians now in power and backed by the rebels. This joint action helped to form a bond between the new government and the insurgents, smoothing the way for a peace dialogue.
The government has released hundreds of rebels from jail, dropped terrorism charges against them, and agreed to a cease-fire.
Earlier Friday, Mahara met with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to decide on an agenda for the peace talks, officials said.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist state in 1996.
""We don't want to return to war again ... We don't want bloodshed in the country,"" Mahara said.

Last January, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed during a visit here to provide new weapons to Nepal to bolster the Himalayan kingdom's antiterrorism campaign.
Washington has also pledged $17 million in military training and equipment, including light weaponry and night-vision gear.
The 3,000 M-16 A-2 assault rifles will replace the Nepalese army's traditional self-loading rifles, the source said.
Nepal had earlier procured about 5,000 M-16 guns, which its uses mainly to train Nepalese soldiers for U.N. peacekeeping missions. Another 500 sub-machine guns imported from Belgium are also expected to arrive this week.
Nepalese human rights organizations have criticized the government's procurement of modern weapons, saying it will escalate the violence and result in more killings of innocent civilians.
There are also widespread fears the new weapons could fall into rebel hands.
Maoist rebels have no known source of arms and supplies, but they have captured weapons from security forces during raids at police posts and army barracks.
According to unofficial figures, the rebels have so far snared more than 1,000 weapons, including light machine guns and Belgian-made automatic rifles.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996, demanding a new constitution to replace Nepal's current basic law.
They want to overthrow the country's monarchy and establish a one-party communist republic in Nepal.
According to government figures, more than 7,200 Nepalese have been killed since the outbreak of the communist insurgency.

"316",20032728,"Title: Gifted Sherpas key to success on Everest.rtf; Date: May 16, 2003 Friday; Text: Since the earliest attempts to conquer the world's highest peak, climbers from around the world have relied on the strength and bravery of the Nepalese Sherpas.
""The Nepalese Sherpas are a naturally gifted community who without any proper training are able to climb tall mountains in the Himalayas carrying heavy loads for the climbers,"" said the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), Ang Tshering Sherpa.
""Most of the Sherpa community spend their childhood grazing their cattle or yaks at high altitudes, routinely climbing to heights of between 5,500 and 5,800 metres (18,000 to 19,000 feet) without jackets or mountaineering gear,"" he added.
Of Tibetan origin, the Sherpas crossed over the Himalayan passes and settled in the foothills of the highest mountains in the world, many of them being born and raised at heights of 4,000 to 5,000 metres (13,000 to 16,5000 feet).
It is their ability to perform at high altitudes and their intense knowledge of the mountains that have made them key to the success of international expeditions, especially up Everest.
Fittingly a Sherpa -- Norgay Tenzing -- was the first to summit Everest, along with New Zealand beekeeper Edmund Hillary, on May 29, 1953.
Norgay's son Jamling, 38, says the role of Sherpas in Himalayan expeditions has been vastly understated by foreigners.
""For 99 percent of the expeditions going to Mount Everest it would not be possible to scale the peak without the help of the Sherpas,"" Jamling Norgay told AFP.
""Sherpas climb Everest for their livelihood but not for pleasure as rich mountaineers do.
""The Sherpas serve as the backbone of all the expeditions, doing jobs such as fixing the ropes on the rocks, paving the route on the steep climb and clearing the icefall and the Hillary step,"" said Norgay, who followed in his father's footsteps as a member of the Everest IMAX Filming Expedition in 1996.
""Without Sherpas it is not possible to climb Everest,"" he added. ""But there is not much recognition of them in the world and they are not brought appropriately into the limelight.""
Sherpas are called on to rescue mountaineers when trouble develops, often risking their own lives, he said.
In their book ""Nepalese Climbers on Everest"", authors Ang Phurba Sherpa and Ramesh Raj Kunwar speak bitterly of the treatment of Sherpas by foreign mountaineers.
""Sherpas have become only the vehicles for taking them to the summit of Mount Everest,"" they write. ""They have only got oral appreciation and negligible tips. They are just hired for fulfilling one's goal. They have been treated as a commodity and are put on sale.""
More than 360 Nepalese Sherpas have climbed Mount Everest since the first ascent, while 57 have died on the mountain.
Some 15,000 Sherpas work in the mountaineering industry, holding jobs ranging from cooks and kitchen staff to porters and high-altitude guides.
The term ""sherpa"" is loosely applied to a Nepalese from any ethnic group engaged in trekking and mountaineering, but in the Everest region the job of ""sherpa"" is handled solely by members of the Sherpa ethnic community.
""While guiding climbers or carrying loads to the mountains many Sherpas every year get frostbitten and lose their toes and fingers, or get killed in accidental falls,"" said NMA executive member Hari Prasad Shrestha.
In view of the risk Sherpas face in the mountains, the Nepalese government in 2002 raised the insurance premium from 100,000 rupees (12,970 dollars) to 500,000 rupees (6,458 dollars) for the variously-ranked Sherpas.
The regulations forbid attempts on Mount Everest and other peaks by anyone aged less than 16, which has protected the record set by Temba Chheri, who scaled Everest from the Tibetan route at the age of 15 years 18 days in 2001.
Sherpas also hold most other Everest records, including the greatest number of ascents -- 12 by Apa Sherpa, and the fastest ascent from base Camp -- 16 hours 56 minutes by the late Babu Chhiri.
Tenzing Norgay, however, stands out.
""The Nepalese Sherpas take mountaineering as their job for remuneration but Tenzing Norgay Sherpa was unique as he wanted to earn name and fame and to be the first to scale Mount Everest -- no matter what the cost,"" said Nepalese geographer Harkha Bahadur Gurung.

"158",20031064,"Title: French -led troops to pull out of eastern DRCongo on 1 September.rtf; Date: August 27, 2003, Wednesday; Text: Text of report by Ugandan newspaper The Monitor web site on 27 August
 Entebbe - The French-led multinational peacekeeping force mandated to pacify Bunia town in eastern DRCongo pulls out next week.
 Capt Charie Vigilant, the force's press attache, said yesterday the 1,500 troops would be out of Bunia by 1 September and would fly out of Entebbe Air base by 15 September.
 The French-led force comprises of Belgian and British troops. The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan yesterday appealed to the Security Council to extend the force's mandate in DR Congo.
The Monitor web site, Kampala, in English 27 Aug 03
Vigilant, however, said the troops had to leave. ""We have to leave. Our mandate is finally over. We are handing over to Task-Force II under the Bangladeshi and Pakistani troops,"" he told The Monitor at his Entebbe base.
 The French troops have since June been leading the European force, under UN mandate, stationed in Bunia, the commercial capital of Ituri region. The French-led force has been referred to as Task Force I.
 Ituri has been a trouble spot since foreign troops, including Uganda and Rwanda, moved into DRCongo in 1998 to topple then president Laurent Kabila. Violence between the ethnic majority Lendu and minority Hema peoples has claimed an estimated 50,000 lives since 1999 and displaced a million others.
 Mission accomplished
 Capt Vigilant said the troops' mandate had been ably executed because the European force managed to restore total peace and calm in Bunia. He said the force had not lost any soldier. The French-led task force was confined to Bunia and was authorised to fire only in self-defence. Vigilant said the troops under Task Force I were pulling out to beat the 1 September deadline.
 Air base busy
 The section occupied by the troops at Entebbe Air Base is busy as soldiers prepare to ship out. Two AN-124 disengaging airplanes, which are normally used to carry troop fleets, were parked at the air base ready to fly the soldiers back. Five French spy-planes, including one ATL-2 and four FI-CA's, had also been withdrawn and are parked at the air base. The C-130 transport planes were still flying to DR Congo and would be used to ferry the troops next week.
 Enter Task Force II
 About 2,000 peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay and Bangladesh, are already in Bunia under Task Force II. Pakistani and Nepalese troops are expected to bring the total to 4,700 in September. Task Force II will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower, including attack helicopters. Their mission is to sufficiently stabilize Bunia and will also operate in the rest of Ituri Province.

"4508",2006478,"Title: Nepali gov't refutes allegations of arms import from India.rtf; Date: September 13, 2006 Wednesday 8:30 AM EST; Text: The Nepali government on  Wednesday slammed the allegations of arms import from India as "" baseless,"" and clarified that the vehicles had been brought in to  transport Nepali soldiers as United Nations peacekeeping forces to Lebanon.
    The government also said it was unfortunate that strikes  founded on baseless rumors had taken place and urged the  guerrillas and other concerned parties stop such activities.
    Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula made the comments at the  Wednesday's sitting of the House of Representatives. 
    ""The talks of weapons entering Nepal are just rumors,"" Sitaula  said.
    According to a government decision, 33 army vehicles had been  brought in to help dispatch the 850 peacekeeping troops being  deployed on the UN's request, Sitaula said, adding that the  vehicles had been in the process of getting a paint-job.
    The home minister also requested the guerrillas not to harbor  any suspicions regarding the army vehicles on their way to  peacekeeping duties, adding that protests and strikes will only  serve to complicate matters. 
    Stating that the government remains steadfast towards upholding its commitments, Sitaula said, ""The government cannot imagine  going back to war.""
    Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (IMEA)  refuted the guerrillas claim that a big consignment of weapons  entered Nepal from India on Tuesday.
    The Nepali guerrilla Wednesday called for a strike outside the  capital city Kathmandu Valley against what it calls ""massive  import of arms cache"" by the Nepal Army (NA) from the country's  eastern frontier.
    Labeling the alleged weapons inflow in the face of the on-going peace talks ""a direct violation"" of the cease-fire code of conduct, the guerrillas have halted all traffic in various highways  throughout the country since Wednesday morning.  
    The guerrilla's Spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said, ""We are  currently trying to find the facts behind the allegations,"" adding that if the NA has indeed imported the arms cache, it will not be  allowed to enter the capital.
    According to the guerrilla's leader Barshaman Pun alias Ananta, four Mine Protected Vehicles, 20 mini trucks, two trucks and five  jeeps carrying arms and ammunition from India entered Nepal via  Birgunj and arrived at the Nepal Army barracks.

"5484",20063486,"Title: India continues mass slaughter of fowl after bird flu outbreak_1.rtf; Date: February 20, 2006 Monday 4:51 AM GMT; Text: Health officials searched houses Monday in western India for signs of people infected with the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus as a massive poultry culling operation entered its second day.
Heavy earth movers were used to dig deep pits at poultry farms in Navapur where workers Sunday dumped more than 200,000 bird carcasses along with the gloves, goggles and blue gowns used by health teams. The pits were coated with chemicals, including disinfectant, before dirt was shoveled over them.
Other farmers burned the chicken carcasses and plumes of black smoke filled the air over now-deserted poultry farms around Navapur, more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Bombay.
The government has said it plans to slaughter some 500,000 birds within a 3-kilometer (1.5-mile) radius of the outbreak.
On Monday, inspectors visited homes and farms surrounding Navapur, a town of 30,000 people, searching for signs of illness and making sure even domestic chickens were killed and properly disposed of.
""It's like a war they come in completely covered with masks and goggles and check if the carcasses are disposed properly,"" said Ghulam Vhora, a member of a Navapur poultry farmers' association.
Since early Sunday, more than 200,000 chickens had been culled around Navapur, a major poultry farming region, where the H5N1 strain of bird flu was found in some of 30,000 dead chickens.
Checkpoints have also been set up to stop people carrying poultry out of the area.
""There must be no movement of poultry out of Navapur,"" said O.P. Tiwari, a health officer in neighboring Surat district.
Local officials near the affected area, meanwhile, reported a 27-year-old poultry farm owner had died of bird-flu-like symptoms, though tests had yet to determine what killed him.
""At this juncture we can only suspect that the cause of his death could be bird flu,"" Surat district officer Vatsala Vasudev told the Press Trust of India news agency, adding officials were still waiting for tests to be completed.
Samples from at least eight people hospitalized for flu-like symptoms near Navapur were also being tested Sunday at The National Institute of Virology. Milind Gore, the institute's deputy director, said results were expected in three days.
The eight were being kept in isolation at Navapur hospital, said Anbalatan, the district health officer, who goes by just one name like many other people in the region.
Bird flu has devastated poultry stocks and killed at least 91 people, mostly in Asia, since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Most human cases of the disease have been linked to contact with infected birds.
But scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that is easily transmitted between humans, sparking a pandemic.
The disease had ravaged some poultry farms in the area.
""We tried everything but (the chickens) never responded to treatment. Within two weeks not even one survived,"" said Danesh Rama, the manager of a farm in the area, which lost thousands of chickens to the flu.
But other farmers, weighed down by fears of huge losses, appealed for more tests in the face of the mass cull.
""We asked the government to do another round of tests to make sure, or people here face ruin,"" said Vhora, from the poultry farmers' association.
The India poultry industry will suffer badly. India exports some US$84.4 million (euro70.6 million) worth of poultry and eggs annually, mostly eggs and egg powder to Europe, Japan and the Middle East.
Neighboring Nepal on Sunday said it was banning imports of all poultry and poultry products from India, while Bangladesh said it would step up surveillance along its border with India to prevent smuggling of birds into the country.
Associated Press reporter Ramola Talwar Badam in Bombay contributed to this report.

 Government's rehabilitation programme for those abandoning violent insurgency has attracted many rebel activists. The experience and response of the former rebels who have been rehabilitated at Dhakaltar in Tanahu is positive.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 4 Feb 04Government has won their hearts and minds. It is now essential for the state and government particularly to give the programme continuity on a long-term basis. It is not enough for the government to give surrenders resettlement opportunities only. The state should treat those who have been misled or coerced with love, care and understanding. Some of the surrenderers may have been forced by circumstances to join the rebels. They need the state's love and understanding. As much as they need physical security, their livelihood must also be guaranteed.
 The rehabilitated former rebels have received a new lease of life at the centre yet they are concerned about their future. But the government has not yet made public its plans and programmes for their security and livelihood. Therefore, a situation has emerged for the government to announce without delay specific and practical plans and programmes for the individual security and independent livelihood of the rehabilitated former rebels. The desire of the rehabilitated at Dhakaltar after abandoning the insurgency is to live independently in a safe environment. They are not in a mood to be guests of the state or a burden.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 20 January
Palpa [west Nepal], 20 January: A security operation has been launched in the jungle area of eastern Palpa district, three days after entry into the jungle was banned.
Security sources said that air and land security personnel have been mobilized in the operation.
A security operation was conducted in eastern Palpa's Bakamalang, Mityal and Jhirubas villages, the local people said. The operation was launched in Palpa on the suspicion that the Maoists who had been dislodged by a similar operation in [neighbouring] Syangja district might have come and taken shelter in the jungle, said the source.
Army helicopters conducted five flights to transport troops for the Palpa operation. Security reinforcements are being made for the operation. The local administration issued prohibitory orders in 22 villages in Palpa on Tuesday [17 January].
Meanwhile, the local people said that four Maoists who were wounded in the Syangja clashes died after their arrival in Palpa. Two of them died at Bakamalang and one each at Jalpa and Khaliban villages.
Our reporter in Kaski [west Nepal] reports that security forces have arrested two Maoists at Buddha Chowk in Pokhara. The rebels were caught in possession of revolvers, said the sources.
The Maoists have admitted that two of their activists were arrested. The rebels have urged human rights workers to ensure the safety of the lives of the arrested workers.

The council re-elected former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda as party president and adopted a political resolution saying ""the demand for reservation in private sector has to occupy top priority while formulating a political agenda"".
  The party said the pursuit of a neo-liberal agenda and withdrawal of the government from social sectors like education and health had thrown the poor to the mercy of the market. Announcing the party's resolve to bring ""all like-minded parties on an alternate radical platform"", the resolution suggested the people's resistance against policies of liberalisation could provide the basis for the new political platform.
  People could be empowered to fight for control over natural resources - peasants for land, fishermen over ocean resources and adivasis and tribals over forest land. In the international sphere, the party said the poor nations should fight globalisation by ""re-organising and strengthening the non-aligned community and India should spearhead this resistance"".
  Moved by Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister M.P. Prakash, the political resolution asked the government to abandon the structural adjustment programme, which had increased the misery of the common man and marginalised him. Criticising the government for ""leaning dangerously towards the USA"", the foreign policy resolution moved by general secretary Kunwar Danish Ali said the vote against Iran at the IAEA showed the government had not followed assurances given by its own foreign minister. The party condemned the repressive measures adopted by the Nepal King in suppressing the agitation for democratic rights.

"1102",20032874,"Title: 10,000 landmines laid by Nepalese army_ NGO.rtf; Date: June 15, 2003 Sunday; Text: The Nepalese army has laid 10,000 anti-personnel mines across Nepal, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).
""10,000 landmines have been laid around 50 army posts as defensive measures,"" said Miriam Coronel Ferrer, one of a six-member ICBL team which has been in Nepal for the last week.
She said they had been given the figure by Director of Military Operations (DMO) Brigadier General Kul Bahadur Khadka.
Khadka told them the army would clear the landmines before they left the posts. It was not known when they were laid.
During a week-long visit, the team met with government and army officials and Maoist rebel leaders to discuss banning the use of landmines in the Himalayan kingdom.
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire on January 29 and have since held two rounds of peace talks aimed at ending seven years of insurgency.
""Since the ceasefire, the Nepal Campaign to Ban Landmines received only one report of a civilian injured by landmines,"" Ferrer told reporters late Saturday.
""But there is a danger that people will fall victim to these mines unless the security forces and the Maoists commit not to use them and clear those areas,"" she said.
Ferrer said they had met senior Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara who said he would consult the rebel leadership on a long term commitment to a total ban on the use of landmines.
Nepal is not a signatory to the 1997 Ottowa Convention, ratified by more than 130 countries, which bans the production and use of anti-personnel mines as well as their storage and transportation.
Ferrer said that between January and December 2002, 5,946 people were killed in fighting between security forces and the Maoists.
They included 4,760 rebels, 539 policemen, 219 soldiers, 22 children and 26 women, Ferrer said, adding the figures were based on reports from ex-lawmakers, newspapers, the army and the police.
She said 720 of those killed were killed by mines.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising as claimed nearly 8,000 lives, according to official figures.

"1985",20042952,"Title: Kashmiris seen upbeat after Nepal conference.rtf; Date: December 14, 2004, Tuesday; Text: Text of report by Tilak P. Pokharel, published by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site on 14 December
 Kathmandu, 13 December: The Pugwash Conference on Kashmir concluded here on Monday 14 December emphasizing on a peaceful settlement of the five-decade old Kashmir dispute.
 The face-to-face meeting of the ""divided Kashmiris"" for the first time in 57 years itself is seen as the biggest achievement of the conference.
 Ghulam Rasoor Dar ""Eiddie"", general secretary of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), once a banned organization in India, which has been fighting for Kashmir's independence since the 1960s, said the conference provided them a platform to meet and interact, for finding solutions to their problem for the first time after the problem erupted in 1947.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 14 Dec 04
""It proved to be a platform for interaction and discussing about our difficulties,"" he told the Post.
 Abbas Rashid, member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning NGO Pugwash that organized the meeting, told the Post that the idea of the conference was to encourage the people from Indian Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir to engage in dialogue for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.
 Rashid said both the governments - India and Pakistan - have taken cognizance of the conference, with the participation of officials from both the countries as observers. ""Pugwash doesn't want to exclude governments,"" he said.
 The conference has generated a momentum for solution of the Kashmir dispute, Rashid said, adding, ""The people from both the Kashmirs were very much comfortable with each other."" He said one of the outcomes of the meeting is it has recognized the Kashmiris as party to the solution of the problem. They also recognized the complexities of the situation, he added.
 ""We want trilateral talks (between India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris),"" Eiddie told the Post. ""India and Pakistan cannot decide our fate. If it is only up to them to decide over us, it won't be acceptable."" He added, ""We are very optimistic about the conference and we fully support it."" Dar also said the next conference may be held some time in March-April (2005).
 The conference was participated by at least 12 leaders from Indian Kashmir and six from the Pakistan-administered Kashmir, among some 55 participants also comprising Kashmiri separatist leaders, politicians, former army chiefs, former bureaucrats, among 80 invitees from Britain the United States besides India and Pakistan.

"2933",2004971,"Title: Nepal unable to fund mosquito nets for all in need.rtf; Date: May 30, 2004, Sunday; Text: Excerpt from report by Nitya Nanda Timsina, published by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site on 30 May
 Kathmandu, 29 May: With the ambitious target of reducing malaria cases in the country by up to 50 per cent in five years, the government is going to distribute 48,000 insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) in the malaria endemic districts of Jhapa far southeastern Nepal , Kanchanpur and Kailali both far western . Even these nets are to come from the World Health Organization (WHO).
 According to Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of the Department of Health Services, 65 out of 75 districts in Nepal are malaria-prone. Out of 65, 12 districts in Terai lowlands are malaria-endemic, with 70 per cent of the total cases reported every year from these places.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 30 May 04
Another 15,000 cases of dangerous form of malaria, plasmodium falciparum (PF), are reported in Jhapa, Kanchanpur and Kailali alone.
 But the decision to distribute one mosquito net to each household is unlikely to protect the entire family members because not all the family members share the same bed.
 Even if one or two kids sleep regularly under one net with their pregnant mothers, rest of the family members are unlikely to be protected from the parasite, which killed four people in Jhapa and Kanchanpur last year.
 It is also unlikely to cover 80 per cent of the approximately 1.6 million people (291,889 households) in the three target districts, given the small number of ITN and large malaria-prone population. Even in those high-risk districts, on an average, the proposed ITN coverage will be about 16 per cent of the total population.
 ""We are providing bed nets mostly to 'needy' - pregnant women and children - the rest should purchase it,"" said Dr Mahendra Bahadur Bista, director, EDCD. But the lack of cash in hand with the people will come as a big bottleneck for the people to buy any extra ITN, a health worker said here during a workshop on implementation of malaria component of Global Fund on Friday 28 May .  passage omitted
 The government requested the Global Fund for a total of 7,624,668 US dollars for the five years, out of which the fund granted 2,622,929 for two years to Nepal to fight malaria and reduce its prevalence by up to 50 per cent in five years.
 The fund has already sanctioned 998,998 dollars to Nepal as first instalment to begin combating the disease.
 Out of the fund, EDCD Department of Health Services wants to purchase vehicles, computers, microscope and ITN as part of its strategy to fight malaria in those districts a la African nations.
 According to a study, with the use of ITN, mortality among children has declined by 25 per cent in Gambia, 33 in Kenya and 17 per cent in Ghana.

"6672",20081636,"Title: Maoists among Bhutan 's Nepali refugees say ready for battle.rtf; Date: October 16, 2008 Thursday 3:05 AM GMT; Text: In a secluded corner of a refugee camp in southern Nepal, Nirmal Chettri outlines his plans for waging a bloody ""people's war"" on the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.
With the intense stare of the ideologically fervent, the 26-year-old said his organisation, the Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist), was ready to start killing for its cause.
He also warned that his faction would step up attacks on thousands of Bhutanese refugees who are leaving the camps in Nepal to start new lives abroad.
""There will be a lot of casualties and destruction but we cannot shy away from fighting for justice,"" said Chettri, one of around 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepalese origin who were forced to flee Bhutan in the early 1990s.
The refugees have languished in UN camps in southern Nepal for more than 15 years, and now -- after the United States offered to resettle at least 60,000 -- many are preparing to leave.
Around 50,000 have signed up for international resettlement, and 5,000 have already left.
But Chettri and his comrades want to stop the exodus, because he believes the refugees have been ""brainwashed and hypnotised"" and that the resettlement programme reduces his party's chances of destroying Bhutan's monarchy -- despite the country having become a constitutional monarchy earlier this year.
In March, Bhutan held its first ever direct parliamentary elections,  ending 100 years of direct royal rule. King Jigme Singye Namgyel Wangchuck remains the constitutional head of the state, and the ruling Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) party has said it still looks to the young monarch for guidance.
Despite the introduction of democracy, Chettri, the Maoist, said this does not alter his party's plans to get rid of Bhutan's royals.
""The changes that they are trying to show the world are farcical and meaningless,"" said Chettri.
""It is still the royal family that runs things, whether they call themselves democratic or constitutional, and we will fight to get rid of them.""
The International Office for Migration (IOM) -- which arranges resettlement -- has been bombed by radical Bhutanese Maoists, and empty buses that ferry refugees to the airport to begin their journeys abroad have also been attacked.
""We hope Nepal's new Maoist government will stop the resettlement. If it is not stopped within the next three months there will be bloodshed,"" said Chettri.
Another Maoist, who gave his name only as Umesh, said their group had been involved in bombings that rocked Bhutan the elections and the government in Bhutan has said the emergence of these Maoist groups is a grave concern.
""Bhutan does not have the capacity to deal with increasing terrorist activities from refugee camps in Nepal, especially as it is focused on ensuring the success of parliamentary democracy,"" Kinzang Dorji, Bhutan's spokesman, told AFP.
Umesh said his party would target the resettlement programme.
""We believe this issue is entirely political in nature, but the United Nations, America and the Nepal government have treated it as humanitarian,"" said the softly spoken 27-year-old.
""Resettlement will only make things more complicated.""
The ultra-leftist said the only solution to the refugee issue was to topple the Bhutan government to allow the refugees to return.
""The root cause of this problem is the autocratic, feudal tyrants and the age-old system that has exploited the people of Bhutan. To solve the problem we have to eradicate this system,"" he said.

Over a hundred people have been injured in the 6.8 magnitude tremblor which has caused extensive damage to buildings and roads in Sikkim and several other places.
The casualties have occurred mostly in the North District and in towns and villages like Rangpo, Dikchu, Singtam and Chungthang located along the course of Teesta river, they said.
In Gangtok, power was restored this morning. Residents had spent the night outside their houses fearing aftershocks. At least 20 aftershocks throughout the night had created panic in the city. The road network and telecommunication system have been affected.
There are fears that several tourists may still be trapped in Gangtok and the surrounding areas. Gangtok is barely 54 km from the epicentre and several tourists may be spread across the many tourist spots around the capital city.
Meanwhile, rain and landslides have hampered the massive rescue efforts of hundreds of workers searching for survivors.
According to reports from Union home ministry, there are 16 landslides in a stretch of 10 km in Sikkim. Reports say several important roads in the state have been washed away and the main highway has been blocked.
Nearly 400 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) reached the Bagdogra airport on Monday morning. The NDRF personnel will be airlifted to the epicentre of the earthquake for the rescue operation. Five more rescue teams have also left Kolkata for Gangtok.
The earthquake has also triggered off landslides, blocking off nearly all roads towards Sikkim's capital Gangtok. Personnel of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) are working on a war footing to clear the blocked roads.
712 personnel of ITBP are already engaged in rescue and relief operations in Sikkim.
The Army has deployed a total of 72 columns including infantry troops and combat engineers, four Dhruv and five Cheetah helicopters.
IAF has deployed 2 C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindan airbase to Bagdogra, carrying 9 tonne of relief material and 200 National Disaster Relief Force personnel. One IL-76 plane hsa been sent from Agra to Bagdogra via Kolkata, carrying 8 tonne of relief material and 110 passengers. Also, an AVRO from Palam, with a 20 member Medical Team, 2 AN-32 medium lift aircraft from Agra, and 8 helicopters have been pressed into service for relief and rescue operations.
West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has left Kolkata for Darjeeling to hold a meeting with the administration at Kurseong at 3pm. Banerjee will be assessing the situation after the meeting in Kurseong with the top brass of the administration. She is likely to visit some worst hit areas in Darjeeling district and give necessary instructions for the rebuilding work.
Mamata Banerjee has announced compensation worth Rs 2 lakh to the family of the deceased. The West Bengal chief minister has postponed her election campaign in Bhawanipore to September 22, where she was supposed to hold a rally on Tuesday. Banerjee is looking to get elected from Bhawanipore assembly constituency in the assembly byelection.
Meanwhile, the quake was felt all the way to Delhi as well as in Bangladesh, shaking buildings. At least 10 people were injured and some buildings suffered minor damage.
Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua reported that at least seven persons have been killed and 22 others injured in Tibet in the quake which has caused landslides and has disrupted traffic, power and water supplies as well as telecommunication in Yadong County, an area 40 km away from Sikkim.
Three people were killed at Lainchaur in Kathmandu, two in Sunsari district, and one each in Dhankuta and Sankhuwasabha districts in eastern Nepal, according to home ministry sources in the Nepalese capital.

Studies show more than 90 per cent of water available in such 'sealed' jars contain bacteria harmful to human health.
One of the studies conducted by Munal Subedi, a lecturer at the Microbiology Department of Amrit Science College, said, of the total 57 jars collected randomly from across the Kathmandu Valley, when put to laboratory test, 91.2 per cent were found contaminated with coliforms and 59.6 per cent with faecal coliforms.
Officials at the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control could not agree more. ""We have found jar water as one of the most contaminated items in the market,"" said Pramod Koirala, Spokesperson, DFTQC.
Only 100 companies producing jar water are registered at DFTQC, say officials. But more than 200 manufacturers are involved in water business. ""By law, the companies must register with DFTQC,"" added Koirala.
DFTQC, on the other hand, itself is in deep water: There are thousands of items in the market needing monitoring, and it has only 10 food inspectors at its disposal.
According to DFTQC, about 20 samples, collected randomly from the market and put under scanner in the last one month, have been found exceeding 'the level safe for consumption' set up by the government.
Worse, despite DFTQC warning and studies showing high level of contamination, water business is thriving, thanks to bureaucratic red tape. DFTQC, every time it finds cases of contamination, forwards them to district administration office to initiate necessary action, but DAO just washes its hands of the issue and refuses to provide data. ""We have initiated action against the companies as per the existing rules,"" shrugged Kailash Shrestha, officer, litigation section, DAO, Kathmandu, and refused to provide exact number of companies that have been penalised.
According to Subedi, about 78 per cent of 525 households surveyed for people's perception on jar water, however, were not sure about its quality.
Ironically, the government and its partner agencies, to coincide with World Water Day, though discussed issues of safe drinking water at length today, commercially sold jar water and ways to improve its quality didn't figure on their agenda. Must have thought the issue is just a big drink of water!

Text of report by Praveen Swami headlined ""Lashkar men's arrest averted strike on BSE"" published by Indian newspaper The Hindu website on 27 March
[Introduction by the paper] Having survived the attack in Rampur, the two fidayeen [suicide attackers] were tasked to execute a similar strike in Mumbai. Both fidayeen had carried out assault on CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] training camp in Rampur. All three BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange] assault-team volunteers held Pakistani passports. 
New Delhi: A group of Lashkar-i-Toiba operatives, arrested in Uttar Pradesh last month, were just days away from executing an attack on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), police sources have told The Hindu. 
Investigators say Fahim Ahmed Ansari, who was arrested last month along with seven other suspects, planned to travel from Rampur to Mumbai in mid-February with two specially trained Pakistanis who were to carry out the strike. 
Both fidayeen, Imran Shehzad from Bhimber in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Mohammad Farooq Bhatti from Gujranwala in Punjab, had carried out the New Year-eve assault on a Central Reserve Police Force training camp in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. Having survived the high-risk attack, the two men were tasked to execute a similar strike on the BSE. 
Officials believe Shehzad and Bhatti could have claimed dozens of lives as guards at the BSE are neither trained nor equipped to prevent a fidayeen-type strike. Typically, fidayeen storm the gates of premises using grenades, following it up with the indiscriminate firing from assault rifles - a tactic used with effect at Rampur and in dozens of similar operations in Jammu and Kashmir. 
Lashkar cells have made repeated plans to hit the BSE in the past. In 2004, for example, Javed Sheikh and Manzoor Ahmed Chilloo are believed to have planned a fidayeen strike. However, the Lashkar succeeded in attacking the exchange during the 1993 serial bombing of Mumbai that claimed over 250 lives. 
The owner of a small-scale paper-envelope manufacturing business, Ansari is believed to have been recruited by the Lashkar during a visit to Dubai in 2003. A one-time activist of the proscribed Students Islamic Movement of India, he received advanced weapons and spy craft training at Lashkar camps in Pakistan over the next four years. 
Uttar Pradesh police officials say Ansari returned to India through Kathmandu in late 2007. He stayed at the Sunlight Guest House from 28 November to 10 December before renting a room off Falkland Road. Ansari then secured a driving licence under the alias Samir Sheikh and enrolled himself as a student at a computer institute near the BSE. 
All three BSE assault-team volunteers held Pakistani passports, which they hoped would enable them to escape through Nepal. Shehzad carried passport number EK5149331, issued on March 14, 2007, while Bhatti used passport number AW3177021, issued a day earlier. 
Ansari's Pakistani passport, BM 6809341, issued on November 1, 2007, bears the pseudonym Hammad Hassan. 
Bangalore connection
Uttar Pradesh authorities say the three men operated under the direct command of Bihar-born Mohammad Sabahuddin, one of the Lashkar's seniormost Indian operatives. Sabahuddin in turn reported to a Pakistan-based commander code-named Muzammil, the man believed to have overall charge of the organisation's offensive operations in India outside of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Like Ansari, who was a one-time SIMI [Students Islamic Movement of India] activist, Sabahuddin also trained at Lashkar camps from 2003 under the tutelage of Muzammil. In mid-2005, investigators say, he returned to India via Dhaka and Kathmandu, traveling on a Pakistani passport. Posing as a medical student, he proceeded to rent a house in Bangalore and study potential targets in the city. 
IISc [Indian Institute of Science] convention
Sabahuddin was eventually drawn by the publicity surrounding the Indian Institute of Science's 2005 convention. Observing that the institute had almost no security cover, he decided a single terrorist would be able to shoot at delegates. Lashkar leaders then despatched a Pakistani fidayeen code-named Hamza, whom Sabahuddin had earlier seen working in Muzammil's office, to execute the strike. 
Identical tactics were used to stage the Rampur attacks. Investigators have found that Sabahuddin's group at first planned to target a military convoy near the headquarters of the Central Army Command at Lucknow. However, these plans were dropped after the group determined the attackers would have a low chance of success.

Schools and businesses were closed while cars and buses stayed off the streets in Katmandu. Government workers were forced to walk to work.
The strike was called by the seven major political parties to protest the killing of 12 civilians by a soldier after an argument in a village near Katmandu.
There were brief scuffles reported Friday between students enforcing the strike and riot police in Katmandu.
Students blocked streets by burning tires and throwing rocks at police.
Hundreds of riot police were stationed on the main streets and patrolled the city.
The strike was announced despite government assurances of an independent investigation and compensation for the victims' families. The government said it would give the family of each fatality 150,000 rupees (US$2,000; [euro]1,660) and cover the costs of medical treatment for those injured.
The Royal Nepalese Army identified the soldier as Basudev Thapa and said he was killed in the incident at Nagarkot village, but did not say how he died.
Thapa, who was reportedly intoxicated, got into an argument with the villagers and returned around midnight on Wednesday and sprayed them with bullets, killing 12 and injuring 19 others, witnesses said.
""The soldier was a frequent visitor to the village but on that night he got in an argument with some of the villagers. Most people fled when the shooting started and hid in nearby areas,"" said Bijaya Thing, who was shot in the arm.
Since King Gyanendra seized absolute power earlier this year, saying he needed total control to defeat communist rebels, the army has faced stepped-up criticism from human rights groups for using excessive force and killing civilians.
The Himalayan country's military has been repeatedly accused of violating human rights in its fight against the rebels.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's monarchy and establish a communist state. About 12,000 people have died in the insurgency.

The fighting, which took place on Saturday at Khandaha village in the district of Arghakhanchi, 335 kilometres (209 miles) southwest of the capital, lasted nearly three hours, Lieutenant Colonel Navjiv Rana said.
""Among the dead, six were soldiers and six policemen while six others were injured during the clashes with the rebels,"" he said.
Rana said the army repulsed the ""huge"" Maoist attack by bringing in reinforcements including ground forces and helicopters.
""They wanted to snatch arms from the security personnel but failed,"" he said.
Monday's Kantipur newspaper had said that 21 soldiers and police were injured in the attack. The Nepali-language daily also said there were ""heavy Maoist casualties"" but Rana was unable to confirm this.
The rebels, who frequently stage hit-and-run raids on security checkpoints and patrols, have stepped up their attacks since King Gyanendra seized power in February.
The king said he took the action to halt the increasingly bloody Maoist revolt which was launched in 1996 and has claimed more than 11,000 lives.

The secretary of the public relations office, Bharat Dhungana, issued a press statement announcing the closure, saying it was linked to the government's close monitoring of the rebels' activities.
Dhungana appealed to the public to strongly protest against what he said was regime's intention to foil the peace process.
""We appeal to the people to strongly protest against such a deceptive move â¦ and pressure (the government) to create a congenial atmosphere for the third round of peace dialogue.""
The government and the rebels have held two rounds of informal talks in the past 10 days in a bid to resolve disputes holding up negotiations to end the seven-year conflict, but have made little headway.
The rebels and the government declared a ceasefire in January, halting the insurgency that has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
They have held two sessions of official talks but the last was more than two months ago and no date has been fixed for a third.
Dhungana said he had been ""kidnapped"" in broad daylight while waiting for a bus on the outskirts of Kathmandu last week.
""While under the security personnel's custody, I was blindfolded, tortured and insulted in the course of interrogation forcing me to inform whether or not the Maoist high command is desirious of holding peace talks,"" he said.

"7796",20116031,"Title: No army cover for GMR project in Nepal.rtf; Date: June 25, 2011 Saturday; Text: Kathmandu, June 25 -- The Nepal government has decided not to deploy army personnel for security of Upper Karnali, a hydropower project being developed by GMR Energy, which was attacked by Maoist cadres last month. Although the cabinet had approved deployment of Nepal Army at the project site on June 15, it was forced to
backtrack following pressure for Maoists, the biggest constituent of the ruling coalition.
Three office buildings belonging to the Indian company were burnt down by a mob on May 22 and two people severely beaten up. Others including 11 Indians working at the site fled to a nearby army camp to save themselves.
""Army will be deployed at Upper Karnali only if the police fail to provide security,"" deputy Prime Minister and home minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara told a parliament committee on Friday.
Citing it as against Nepal's interests, Maoists have been opposing GMR's involvement in the 900 MW project spread across the Dailekh, Accham and Surkhet districts of western Nepal.
Following the cabinet's decision to deploy Nepal Army for security of the project, senior Maoist leaders had been voicing anger and pressurizing the government to stop the move.
""We will launch protests within the parliament and on the streets if the government doesn't revoke the decision,"" Maoist politburo member Dharmendra Bastola had warned earlier this week.
Despite witnesses identifying several local Maoist leaders as being present in the attack on GMR's offices last month, Maoists have denied any involvement in the incident. No arrests have been made yet.
Maoists had also targeted the Upper Karnali project earlier and during his Nepal visit in April, External Affairs Minister SM Krishna had strongly taken up this issue with Nepal government and the Maoist leadership.
Maoists have refused to let GMR continue work on the project and are demanding cancellation of the contract. The party has also imposed fresh conditions like renegotiation of MoU.
GMR started work on the project after winning a global bid. The same group is also developing the 600 MW Upper Marsyangdi-II project in Lamjung and Manang districts in central Nepal.

"6684",2008419,"Title: Maoists ahead in early Nepal counting.rtf; Date: April 11, 2008 Friday 4:09 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, April 11 -- In a boost to their electoral prospects, Nepal's Maoists have established leads in 32 of the 62 constituencies for which trends were available late on Friday evening. The former insurgents look to be doing well in Thursday's Constituent Assembly elections, whose winners will frame a new statute for Nepal.
  According to available trends, the CPN (UML) was leading in 14 constituencies and the Nepali Congress in 12. Other parties were ahead in four seats. The first result came from Kathmandu 1 constituency, where EVMs were used, with Prakash Man Singh of the Nepali Congress defeating Education Minister Pradip Nepal of the CPN (UML).
  The process of counting for 239 seats under the first-past-the-post system started late on Friday even as re-polling was announced in 33 polling stations across the country. Counting in the mountainous constituencies is likely to start from Saturday morning as officials took several hours to reach counting centres with ballot boxes.
  Unidentified militants detonated a bomb near a counting centre in Birgunj. Most results are likely to come by Saturday afternoon, election commission officials said. Also, in Kathmandu, Maoist chief Prachanda was leading in constituency 10, while the Nepali Congress is leading in constituencies 3, 4, 5 and 9. The Maoist candidates are ahead in four constituencies, and Yogesh Bhattarai of CPN (UML) is leading in constituency No. 6.
  Veteran politician, Madhav Kumar Nepal, who is the general secretary of CPN (UML) is trailing in Kathmandu 2. The CPN (UML) appeared to have suffered a setback in Kathmandu, which has been its bastion.
  The Madheshi Peoples Rights Forum (MPRF) is doing well in Banke district; leading in two out of the four seats. However, Maoists are leading in Banke constituencies 1 and 4. In Bardiya district, the Maoists are leading in all the four constituencies, while they have established leads in three districts of Dang district.
  Maoist spokesman and Information minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara was also leading. In Lalitpur district, social welfare minister Pampa Bhushal is leading in constituency 1, while Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula is trailing in Jhapa-6 constituency. In Bhaktapur district, the Nepal Workers' and Peasants Party is leading in both the constituencies.
  The election is the final step of a peace process that ended the Maoists' decade-long armed struggle, leading to polls for a 601-seat assembly that will most likely abolish King Gyanendra's rule in the world's only Hindu monarchy.

Trilochan was killed during a clash last year. His wife remarried another man just a month after he was killed, leaving the children behind without any care. Since then the children have been living on aid donated by villagers.
 ""After mother's re-marriage, we lived on whatever food was left in our home. When we ran out of food, we lived for days without food,"" says Srijana.

"3925",2005550,"Title: Post Bihar, reds eye Orissa industry nodes.rtf; Date: December 15, 2005 Thursday 10:26 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Dec 15 -- AFTER RETURNING with a bang in the killing fields of Bihar's Jehanabad district with a daring jail raid last month, it is battleground Orissa for the red army.
  In keeping with its renewed objective of targeting large industries displacing the poor - announced at a recent rendezvous with the press at an undisclosed destination along the Indo-Nepal border - the Maoists are mobilizing cadre at Kalinga Nagar near Jajpur. It is the state's new industrial nervecentre.
  While Nilachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) and Mid-east Integrated Steel Limited (MISL) have set up steel plants in Kalinga Nagar, Tisco is acquiring land for a Rs 15,000-crore project. Posco and Essar are also planning mega-projects in Jagatsinghpur, not very far from Kalinga Nagar.
  The Maoists have launched a covert movement to win over people likely to be displaced by the steel projects. Sukinda legislator Prafulla Ghadei, also the state's finance minister, told HT, ""The Maoists are trying to strike base in the Orissa jungles. Their immediate goal is to cash in on the simmering resentment of the local people. To counter the Maoists, we have launched an outfit Biju Sena comprising nearly 1,000 youth activists to interact with the local people."" State intelligence officials smell Maoist hand behind the agitations against the steel projects at Kalinga Nagar by the displaced. They fear that the Naxals are also eyeing the iron-ore mining areas of Barbil and Joda in Kheonjhar districts bordering Jharkhand.
  The area is a virtual goldmine for the guerrillas. A successful raid would not only give them access to explosives, used in mining, but also ample cash. The mines keep ready cash at their disposal to pay the temporary workers. DIG, western range, Satyajit Mohanty, told HT, ""The Maoists have spread their roots in Gua and Noamundi areas of Jharkhand's West Singhbhum district. We have been conducting joint raids to bust their hideouts.""
  So long, the Maoists were operating on the Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh border. No 'liberated zone' or 'red corridor' links their bases in the south and west to Kalinga Nagar. Hence, the government rules out immediate raid. But whenever the reds strike, the state machinery wriggles out citing intelligence lapse.

"7616",20111827,"Title: Haiti leader demands probe of alleged UN assault.rtf; Date: September 5, 2011 Monday 1:04 PM GMT; Text: Haitian President Michel Martelly has ""vigorously condemned"" an alleged sexual assault by U.N. troops against an 18-year-old man, an incident that has aggravated mistrust between Haitians and the peacekeeping mission.
A news release from the president's communications office late Sunday described the incident as an ""act that revolts the national conscience"" and it said that Martelly is awaiting a detailed report. He asked Haitian officials to meet with U.N. officials to prevent such acts from happening again, it said.
The U.N. is investigating allegations that five Uruguayan naval personnel at a U.N. base in southern Haiti sexually molested an 18-year-old man in an attack reportedly captured by a cell phone camera. The soldiers were confined to their barracks pending the outcome of the probe.
The U.N. mission learned of the charges last week and the scandal prompted Uruguay to sack its naval chief in Haiti.
The clip shot with a cell phone camera shows several men in camouflage uniforms laughing as they pin down a young man on a mattress. The men seem to be saying ""no problem"" in Spanish as they hold the teen's arms and hands behind his back. The camera jumps around, and it is not clear from the video what's happening.
A magistrate in Port-Salut, the southwestern coastal town in which the assault allegedly happened, has gathered testimony from the alleged victim and his mother and filed it in court
Some residents in Port-Salut planned to demonstrate against the U.N. on Monday in support of the alleged victim and his family and to call for the ouster of the peacekeepers there.
Martelly has called for a reduced U.N. presence in Haiti, with troops focusing more on development instead of security matters.
When he ran for office, he called for revival of the Haitian Army, which was dissolved in 1995 because of human rights abuses. It is unclear who would finance a new military, and the nearly 12,000 U.N. soldiers and police deployed nationwide have been key in supporting Haiti's economy and providing security.
The U.N. peacekeeping mission arrived in Haiti in 2004 after former President Jean-Bertrand was toppled in a rebellion. Relations between the troops and many Haitians have been strained, with critics accusing the force of using heavy handed tactics.
Tensions worsened last year after a unit of peacekeepers from Nepal was blamed by many people for an outbreak of cholera in Haiti. The epidemic has killed more than 6,200 people and sickened more than 438,000, Haiti's Health Ministry says.

 Kathmandu, 1 May: Some 15,000 workers and trade union activists Sunday [1 May ] came on the streets of the capital to mark the May Day demanding trade union rights, restoration of multi-party democracy, and human rights in the Himalayan kingdom seething in protests after King Gyanendra upturned an elected government and appropriated power on 1 February.
 The rally came after a day the government in a laconic statement said it had lifted the state of emergency, but kept press censorship and ban on political activities in place.
 Organized by five trade union conglomerates, including Nepal Trade Union Congress affiliated to the Nepali Congress and General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GFONT), the rallyists had compatriots from India, Japan, Belgium and Sweden marching with them.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 13:47 GMT, 1 May 05
The demonstrators went round the city carrying placards and banners demanding democracy and trade union rights but remained outside the prohibited area in the capital avoiding direct clash with the heavily deployed police personnel. They converged on Nayabaneshwor, in front of the office of the king-appointed powerful Royal Corruption Control Commission (RCCC).
 ""Our movement is aimed at restoring multiparty democracy, basic human rights, trade union rights and press freedom, said Achyut Raj Pandey, general secretary of NTUC affiliated to Nepali Congress.
 ""We extend solidarity to the movement for restoration of democracy being launched by the five major parties,"" he said.
 Among the prominent international representatives who took part in the rally were Guman Singh, organizing secretary of the Indian National Trade Union Congress and R.A. Mittal of Hind Majdur Sabha, India, and N. Suzuki, general secretary of International Confederation of Free Trade Union-Asia and Pacific (ICFTU-APRO).
 Journalists, lawyers, schoolteachers, professors, human rights activists also took part in the rally to express solidarity. Meanwhile, representatives from 25 human rights groups in a joint statement condemned the government's acts of indiscriminate arrests and blocking of political activities.
 ""We strongly oppose last week's police intervention at the central office of Nepal Communist Party-UML; arrest of deposed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba at midnight on corruption charges and indiscriminately arresting political activists by security personnel,"" said the statement.
 Subodh Pyakurel, president of Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC), human rights activists Gopal Siwakoti and Sobhakar Budhathoki, who signed the statement, also demanded the government to maintain rule of law, guarantee political freedom and respect International Human Rights Declaration.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 24 January
Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 24 January: The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday for a new mission in Nepal, expected to include 186 military monitors to help enforce a fragile peace pact between the government and Maoist rebels.
The council last month approved an advance group of 35 monitors in response to formal requests from both sides that the United Nations intervene immediately to monitor disarmament of the rebels and make sure the army stays in its barracks. [passage omitted]
The British-drafted resolution says the new operation would be called UNMIN, the UN Mission in Nepal, headed by a special representative, currently Briton Ian Martin.
The council also took note of the secretary-general's expectation that the operation ""will be a focused mission of limited duration"".
The resolution outlined main tasks for the mission, which will manage arms and armed personnel from both the government and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), in line with the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and support this year's planned elections.
As part of its work, the UNMIN will ""provide technical support for the planning, preparation and conduct of the election of a Constituent Assembly in a free and fair atmosphere, in consultation with the parties"" and ""provide a small team of electoral monitors to review all technical aspects of the electoral process, and report on the conduct of the election"".
The council noted that both sides had asked for UN assistance in implementing key aspects of the peace deal, and also recognized the ""strong desire of the Nepalese people for peace and the restoration of democracy."" The 15-member body further highlighted the need to pay ""special attention"" to the needs of women, children and traditionally marginalized groups in the peace process.

A three-member team from Epidemiology and Disease Control Division arrived in Nepalgunj to investigate the claim. The team comprises Dr Suman Thapa, Dr Prakash Ghimire and Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, according to the District Public Health Office (DPHO).
Of the people who sought treatment after falling ill following consumption of the medicine against elephantiasis, Salman Shesh of Nepalgunj-1, 65-year-old Bhuresh Kandhu of Belbhar-6, one-year-old Adhi Dhobi of Belbhar-8, and 80-year-old Tilku Chaudhary of Shumshergunj-6 passed away, their family members claimed.
DPHO Chief Dhir Jung Shah, however, did not confirm the cause of the deaths.
Medicine against elephantiasis was administered in 36 districts, including Banke, last Saturday. A large number of people fell ill after consuming the medicine. The number of people reaching hospitals to seek treatment at Bheri Zonal Hospital and Nepalgunj Teaching Hospital after falling ill has steadily risen.
Hospital sources say more than 150 people have sought treatment for complications they developed after taking the medicine.
Shah, however, said that common side effects like dizziness, stomachache, and fever subside after a few days.
Meanwhile, at a press conference, Dr Suresh Kanaudiya, president of Bheri Doctors' Association, and Sunil Shrestha, chief of Appellate Bar Association, among others, have demanded clarification from the government about the quality of medicine that was administered.

Dhangadhi [town in far western Nepal]: The Samyukta Tharu Rastriya Morcha [United Tharu National Front] constituted in the western Tarai [southern plains] by a group rebelling against the Maoists shut down the Tarai on Monday [13 August]. The front has also announced a shutdown of Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur [districts in mid-western and far western Nepal] on Tuesday.
The chairman of the front, Laxman Tharu ""Roshan"", issuing a communiquÃ© on Sunday, said the first amendment of the interim constitution on 9 March 2007 declared the 20 districts of the Tarai as Madhesh, thereby locking up the 3m Tharu people into internal colonial exploitation and ending their communal identity and also thoroughly insulting them, and the shutdown was organized in protest against all that.
""The ill intention of trying to turn the Tarai into Madhesh and the Tarai people into Madheshis in spite of their separate identity, language and culture will never be acceptable"", the communiquÃ© states. The front said that a peaceful movement would be taken up against the insult meted out by the state and for their political rights, inclusive of ethnic identity.
CPN [Communist Party of Nepal]-Maoist Unified Rebel Front western command in-charge and United Tharu National Front leader Antic accused Maoist chairman Prachanda of running away from the revolution. He said they had taken to revolting and initiated a struggle as there was need for a people's war-part two and a popular movement-part three. He said, in clarification: ""But this movement will not be sectarian as in the eastern Tarai"".

US Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made these designations, which came into effect on April 29.
""As a result of these designations, the US government excludes members and those providing material support to such entities from the United States.

They were released by immigration officials from Dilli Bazaar Jail in Kathmandu, but picked up by the police, Wangchuk Tshering, head of the Tibetan Welfare Centre, told AFP.
Twenty-one Tibetans were arrested here in mid-April after entering Nepal en route to Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama and other leading Tibetan figures live in exile.
Three of them were young children who were handed over to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), according to an immigration official here.
The others, including eight aged younger than 16, were detained and ordered to pay fines of up to 64 dollars each.
On Thursday, Tibetan activists said they faced deportation to Tibet after the intervention of Chinese officials and faced being sent to concentration camps as punishment for fleeing Tibet.
""These destitute Tibetans are now detained at the local police cell at Hanuman Dhoka and it is not immediately known whether they will be deported to Tibet or to India,"" Wangchuk said.
He said about 100 Tibetan refugees living in Nepal had gathered outside the jail.
The head of the Immigration Department Shubarna, Lal Shrestha, denied that the Tibetans had been handed over to Chinese embassy officials.
""These 18 Tibetans detained in a local jail for over a month were released Thursday,"" he said.
UNHCR official Giulia Ricciarelli-Ranawat said they had asked the Nepalese government to hand the Tibetans over to them.
""We have appealed to the Nepalese government that they should not be handed over to the Chinese authorities.""
There are between 30,000 and 35,000 Tibetan refugees settled in Nepal, but the kingdom is careful not to anger Beijing and has refused to let the Dalai Lama visit.
The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize three decades later for his non-violent opposition to Beijing's presence in Tibet.

He said after looking at the nature of protests late Tuesday (31 August) at Ratnapark area, they had requested deputy prime minister, home minister and other senior officials to declare curfew from early Wednesday.

Even though the government has not succeeded in incorporating the parties into the Council of Ministers in the past, the strategy is to make the parties supportive of the plan from without.
 ""The matter was on the agenda of Friday's 10 October cabinet meeting,"" said one minister. ""Before the election processes are complete, the government is trying to implement the programmes that it had made public earlier."" The plan presented by the government during the Maoist peace talks is to be implemented under the ""mobile government"" programme announced one and half months ago.
 The agenda points presented in the talks with the Maoists will be implemented in the ""mobile government"" programme under the one-year work plan. The issues include special treatment of women, the downtrodden, ethnic minorities, indigenous people in education and employment, and positive discrimination in areas of public representation, distribution of citizenship papers, and assurance regarding security.
 The government is to hold the local elections from next Baisakh April to Asar June and the general elections six months after that.

Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 16 April
Kathmandu: The Maoist-affiliated All Nepal National Free Students Union (Revolutionary) has admitted that their outfit is freely involved in the current street protests of the seven parties.
We are freely taking part in the street protests because the movement is the result of the agreement between the seven political parties and the Maoists. ""This is our right,"" the union has said.
We are not infiltrating. We are participating in the movement in an open way, the rebel student union said in its statement issued after its two-day long central committee meeting.
The student union chief Lekh Nath Neupane said that many district and local student leaders were seriously injured during the street protests. He requested the help of the human rights workers and journalists as there is  the growing possibility of the arrested leaders and workers being disappeared by the government.
The rebel students organization has announced a six-phase protest programme against the government which include banning certain school textbooks and declaring the educational institutions as ""Republican Institutions"".
The meeting of the students union has decided to change the names of university and colleges which are named after the royal family members.
The rebel students have decided to prepare and publish the details of the army and police personnel who were involved in killing and injuring the protesters during the ongoing movement. Actions will be taken against them, the students have said.
The Maoist-affiliated students have also announced that they would destroy the statues [of kings] and monuments and donate blood to treat those injured in the movement.

PIA's marketing director, Kamran Hasan, said the airline also plans to boost its total flights to India to 12 in March, the same number it flew before the ban was imposed due to strained relations.
Beginning the first week of January, the airline will operate two flights each on its Karachi-New Delhi, Karachi-Bombay and Lahore-New Delhi routes, Hasan said.
Earlier this month, as part of confidence-building measures, India and Pakistan agreed to restore airline overflight and landing rights by Jan. 1, two years after the nuclear-armed rivals cut all transportation links amid tensions that took them to the brink of war.
Hasan said PIA, Pakistan's state-run airline, also plans to resume six flights to three other South Asian destinations in January: two to the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka; two to Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo; and two to Nepal's capital, Katmandu. PIA closed these flights because they were too costly when India barred Pakistani overflights in early 2002.

 Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari had arrived Washington DC to participate in the meeting of World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He spoke to Girish Pokharel for Gorkhapatra on Wednesday afternoon 6 October at the Royal Nepalese Embassy in Washington. Excerpts from the conversation:
 Q: These days you are calling for informal talks to get formal talks started. Why? We have heard that informal talks are continuing. Your party's General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist), SPN-UML , Girijababu former PM Girija Prasad Koirala and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba have all met the Maoists. Why do you need such talks now?
 A: Various party leaders held talks with the Maoists in the past at a party level. That is good because that has also contributed to making environment for talks. What I meant is there should be informal talks with the Maoists to ascertain the agenda and process for formal talks. This means, the Maoists will appoint their representative and the government also will do the same and we can start secret talks. The prime minister has said this two or three times before.  Passage omitted
Gorkhapatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 9 Oct 04, p.10
I talked about informal talks to foil the attempt of those who want to disrupt the talks process or do not want to see the talks happen. Such elements are inside and outside the country. So when we cannot go straight for a serious plan then we can hold talks for that.
 Q: What are the elements that want to disrupt the talks?
 A: Those who oppose talks are those elements. Now due to the Maoists, the patriotic forces, government, all political parties, human rights workers, civil society, king, army, police and everyone has been mired in problems. India, the European Union, the UN, China, among others, are mired in the problem. When so many parties are now mired and involved, talks could not take place without the help of all these parties.  Passage omitted
 Q: No one is seen opposing talks but why is the process not making headway?
 A: It is not the point that there are no people opposing talks. Some people say one thing and do something else. The foreign elements inside and outside the country who wish harm on Nepal and the Nepalese, who do not want to see the talks happen are brokering murder and violence. Hesitation is another reason behind the talks not taking place. But now the Maoist leadership is also gradually changing its position.
 The Maoists who previously ruled out talks with the king's servants are now demanding proof of government status to hold talks. The Maoists' top leadership knows well there is no safe exit other than talks. There had never been pressure for talks like now. Talks will take place, there is no alternative.
 Q: The king can appoint you and sack you, so isn't the Maoists allegation regarding your status true?
 A: It is true that we were appointed as per Article 127 of the Constitution. But you need to see us politically. If you see politically you see that the king after 4 October 2002 appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime minister and then Surya Bahadur Thapa to the post. This government is different from them. This is a government formed by four parties. A 43-point programme was made public before forming the government. The leaders of all the four parties signed to implement the 43-point common minimum programme. The government was formed to implement the programme. Neither the king nor Sher Bahadur Deuba appointed me deputy prime minister. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist) CPN-UML nominated me and the four parties appointed me. Don't be confused about that.
 Q: How can you say the same Article 127 appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand but not you?
 A: There was no alternative to form government other than through Article 127. But, we were political people so we did political analyses. Our parties have sent us in the government as their representatives. The king appointed a leader who was agitating on the streets. The same leader talked to us four parties and this government was formed.
 Q: But when Surya Bahadur Thapa was prime minister, he invited you to join the government and had you joined then it would also have been the parties' government.
 A: Surya Bahadur Thapa did not represent his party, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. But now an agitating leader has been made prime minister. The leader spoke to Girija Prasad Koirala and other parties but they did not join. We should understand the political situation. There is no parliament now so we should understand it politically. Even the international community has supported the government.
 Q: You claim that you backed out from the movement to give political outlet. It's been so many days, what outlet have you given?
 A: We launched agitation and made proposals for progre"

Text of report by Nepalese Kantipur Television on 17 November
[Presenter] A senior minister has said that the government is closely watching the talks being held between [Nepali] parties and Maoists in New Delhi. Speaking at a Reporters' Club talk programme today, Minister for Education and Sports Radha Krishna Mainali said that the government would adopt strict policies against them if they start working against the national interest. He said that the government had already received reports about [Nepali] Congress and leftist leaders meeting in New Delhi and that it was awaiting the result of those meetings.
[Mainali, addressing the function] These politicians who find unease in working with the king to resolve the crisis in the country have gone to kneel down before foreigners, served foreign diplomats and pleaded to rebels who indulge themselves in inhumane activities to preserve their existence. They have promised them a common platform while talking to them in their meetings in some remote corner of New Delhi.
[Presenter] Mainali said that the role of several countries was very inappropriate and suggested that they abandon dual standards in dealing with terrorism.
[Mainali] Somehow, the killing of Nepalese is a revolution while if the same kind of killing takes place in their country, it becomes terrorism. We may be finished off in the process, we may be destroyed, and our country might turn into pieces. How will this benefit our friends? What will happen to them after that? Is blood not being spilled in their own country? How concerned are they about it? What is going on today in the dark shadows or some dark room without the permission of the Nepalese government?
[Presenter] Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala, Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist [CPN-UML] General Secretary Madhav Nepal and other leaders of the seven agitating parties are holding talks with Maoist leadership in New Delhi at present. Indian Ambassador to Nepal Shiv Shankar Mukherjee and American Ambassador James Moriarty also left for Delhi to join the talks. 
[Reports have said that Madhav Nepal suddenly left for Delhi yesterday immediately after talks with Indian envoy Mukherjee at his party office. He had arrived from India only a couple of days ago].

"6923",20082338,"Title: Hannah Foster's parents say 24-year jail term too less for rapist-murderer Kohli.rtf; Date: December 3, 2008 Wednesday; Text: London, Nov 26 (ANI): Parents of Hanna Foster, a 17-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by a driver of India origin in 2003, have said that the convict, Maninder Pal Singh Kohli (41), should have been sentenced to life imprisonment.
The Winchester Crown Court had yesterday awarded a 24-year jail sentence to Kohli after finding him guilty of rape and murder.
Speaking to media persons after the sentence was pronounced, Hannah's father Trevor Foster said that the jail sentence was less if matched with the gravity of crime (of callously depriving his daughter the right to life) committed by him.
""We have done everything we can in pursuit of justice for Hannah. However, we cannot accept and never will be able to accept, how a complete stranger can abduct, rape and murder your teenage daughter, still a child in the eyes of the law, and yet not end his days in prison. Kohli will, in all probability, walk out of jail after serving his recommended minimum sentence and resume his life in the outside world. This man callously deprived Hannah of her primary human right - the right to life.
This sentence gives him the right to a second chance at life, a second chance he never gave Hannah. To see Kohli's life valued in this way when he showed such utter disregard for Hannah's is hurtful beyond measure. The punishment should fit the crime. In this case, it most certainly did not,"" The Telegraph quoted him as saying.
The girl's mother Hilary said that Kohli adopted every means to evade trial. She said: ""I feel as though Kohli has ripped out my heart and stamped on it. For five long years this cowardly murderer has dominated our thoughts and our lives. He has done everything possible to delay our grieving process.
He fled from the UK jurisdiction, went into hiding in India and used every ploy to delay the extradition process refusing to acknowledge guilt or responsibility for his crimes.""
Hannah was killed on March 14, 2003 and her body dumped in brambles on the outskirts of Southampton. The 17-year-old girl had secretly called 999 but ended up getting disconnected when she couldn't talk directly to the operator.
Kohli fled to India four days later and spent 17 months on the run before being arrested on the Indian-Nepalese border in July 2004. Soon after his arrest, he confessed to his crimes, but withdrew his statement later, much to the agony of Hannah's parents Trevor and Hilary. (ANI)

"4004",2005596,"Title: Ultra Pradesh.rtf; Date: July 9, 2005 Saturday 4:46 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, July 9 -- IT IS the worst terrorist strike in Uttar Pradesh's history. And it has spawned one of the biggest investigations of its kind.
  The probe into the suicide attack in Ayodhya involves three states and a nation. From Uttar Pradesh to Jammu & Kashmir, from Delhi to Nepal, the law enforcement agencies are trying to figure out how the terrorists carried out their attack, who helped them and what others of their ilk might do next.
  Along the way, all that is known is that the terrorists had definite linkages with Akbarpur. It was this place where the arrival of terrorism to UP was signalled by blasts in the Gomti Express and Kasaibara locality near Agra Cantonment. The year was 2000.
  Blasts in the Sabarmati Express at Roshanmau, Faizabad, Vidhan Sabha canteen and Arya Nagar in Kanpur shook the State.
  The attack in Ayodhya was always coming, given the importance of the temple and the potential to foment communal trouble by targeting it.
  In 2003, Lashkar commander, Imran, was killed while on way to blowing up Hanumangarhi. His Jaish-e-Mohammad counterpart Mushtaq Dar met his nemesis in Noida just days before he was to mount the attack.
  The groups were trying hard for long and success eluded them. But, five years of labour on a two-pronged strategy of making UP their operational base and hitting Ayodhya, finally paid off.
  ""This is not the first and certainly is not going to be last?they have more action planned in the State,"" says an officer of the UP Police coordinating with the Central agencies. He seems right. And the series of developments that unfolded before and after the Ayodhya attack only confirmed that the terrorists were here to stay.
  The theory gains further credence as the groups braved all operations. Since August 2002, joint operations busted 56 terrorist cells in UP alone. Twenty-three militants were eliminated and 79 arrested.
  The teams deciphered that 43 were multi-tasked cells with activities ranging from raising funds, finding safe houses in areas around Delhi, giving safe channels to foreign mercenaries coming in from Nepal, repackaging explosives, arranging for transportation. The biggest of all modules were two run by Abu Ulfat of Lashkar and Mohd Lateef of JeM in Sahranpur. Before being netted, the chief operators had arranged jobs for foreign mercenaries as imams, teachers and even helped several set up their own businesses.
  A cell run by Hamid Kashmiri had routed Rs 93 lakh to Hizbul operational chief Saiful Islam through three nationalised banks at Kanpur, Etawah and Faizabad. The money was drawn in five installments as Hamid had disclosed following arrest at Saharanpur. Other cells were purely dedicated to growth in UP, in terms of manpower.
  Since then 178 boys (the official figure) landed across the border, with 90 being killed at different places. Of the remaining 88 identified boys, 33 have Indian passports, and are still untraceable. This figure does not include almost 17 boys enrolled by the two modules of Maulvi Sadaat Rashid and Masood Alam (which were cracked recently in the State Capital). The disclosures of the module operators were startling enough to daze investigators.
  It offered ideological support, motivated boys in abundance, and plenty of fund-raising channels ever since the Babri mosque was demolished, and a section of Muslim clergy and Indian Muslims got their loyalties subverted.
  Maulana Fazulul Rehman Khalili, the founder of Harkat Ul Ansar, Maulana Masood Azhar the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammad, the ideologue of Hizb e Islami, Afghanistan, Mullah Nasrullah Langrayal and Turkish national Hussain Al Yalmaz of Islamic Brotherhood extensively toured UP in 1993 to forge an alliance between clergy and the jehadi groups. It could easily be seen in the way the Students' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) changed itself according to the needs of various militant groups.
  They attended numerous meetings mostly in Western UP, exhorting the youth to repulse the onslaught on their religion. It was after this visit that both Maulana Azhar and Mullah Langrayal were arrested in Jammu and Kashmir. But the essential part of the story was being scripted by Al Yalmaz who laid the foundation for a strong network through the HAZA group, Alma-e-Tanzeem Movement and Lashkar-e-Babri with main offices at Ferozabad, Mathura, Agra and Meerut.
  In fact, Salim aka Salar, now suspected for masterminding the fresh attack, was the one as HAZA cadre, who had set off a series of blasts in buses at Modi Nagar, Meerut and Dausa in Rajasthan, on the orders of then UP chief Abdul Matin aka Mosaib, a fact he acknowledged after being arrested in 1997.
  As a senior officer now involved investigation says, ""the terrorists were always the strongest where we were weakest - the bazaars, the tea stalls, mosques, seminaries.
  ""They built a network with a back up that never let them out of the saddle. If the security agencies scored success, the terr"

A deadline for France to revoke a controversial ban introduced Thursday on the Islamic headscarf in state schools has passed with no word from the Islamist militants who seized the two men on August 20.
But seven foreign hostages held for six weeks were freed by their kidnappers on Wednesday after their Kuwaiti employer paid a half a million dollar ransom, and one of the French journalist's bosses said he held out ""cautious hope"".
In Fallujah, two buildings were destroyed when a US fighter jet struck an alleged hideout belonging to wanted Jordanian militant Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, according to police, medical officials and the US military.
Rescue workers had pulled 20 bodies from the rubble by Thursday morning as bulldozers cleared wreckage and a crowd dug through the debris and searched for body parts and bits of flesh, said rescue worker Hossam Ibrahim.
""All the wounded are families. Among the dead, there could be two or three children but the bodies are torn to pieces and it's difficult to tell,"" Doctor  Doctor Seifeddin Taha of the Fallujah general hospital told AFP late Wednesday.
Two giant craters gouged the ground, leaving one house completely destroyed and another badly damaged. The blast knocked down several palm trees and smashed up furniture and television could be seen in the wreckage. 
The US military described the attack as a ""precision"" strike on ""safe houses and meeting locations"" for associates of Zarqawi whom US officials blame for dozens of car bomb attacks in Iraq and who has a 25-million-dollar bounty on his head.
Earlier Wednesday, Zarqawi supporters were observed removing a corpse from a car trunk and burying the body in southern Fallujah, the military said.
Another five people were killed and 42 wounded on Saturday when US marines pounded suspected Islamist positions in the restive city, where the military has regularly bombed suspected Zarqawi safe houses in Fallujah since June.
In April, Fallujah was the scene of bitter fighting, leaving hundreds dead as US marines and insurgents clashed in the streets. US forces besieged the city after four American civilian security contractors were killed in Fallujah and two of the bodies mutilated.
But since the failed April assault on Fallujah, the city has become a no-go zone for US ground troops and the area has fallen under total control of insurgents, dominated by Islamic fighters.
The city has become associated with the wave of kidnappings of scores of foreigners since April.
In the latest hostage crisis, French diplomats were racing Thursday to rescue two French reporters snatched on August 20 by a group identified as the Islamic Army of Iraq.
The group says it will only free Le Figaro journalist Georges Malbrunot and Radio France correspondent Christian Chesnot if France scraps the controversial headscarf law.
A French Muslim delegation was in Baghdad for talks aimed at securing the pair's release after meeting French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier in Amman Wednesday.
French officials were ""nearly certain"" late Wednesday that two journalists held hostage in Iraq were still alive, Le Figaro editor-in-chief Jean de Belot said, adding that he was holding out ""cautious hope"" for the two men.
Nepal was observing a day of mourning for 12 workers murdered in cold blood in Iraq by their kidnappers as protests spread to the west of the Hindu kingdom following two deaths during riots in the capital.
Another seven truck drivers from Kenya, India and Egypt held hostage for six weeks were however freed on Wednesday after their Kuwaiti employer paid a half a million dollar ransom.
Meanwhile, US forces and insurgents clashed in the western city of Ramadi, leaving two civilians killed and 11 wounded, said police Lieutenant Abdullah Khalaf.
In central Iraq, near the Iranian border, four Iraqi national guardsmen were wounded when a grenade was tossed at their vehicle in the town of Mandalay, police said.
In Baghdad, US troops patrolling the streets of the Shiite rebel bastion of Sadr City called on fighters from Moqtada Sadr's Mehdi Army to turn in their heavy weapons after the firebrand cleric called for a truce.
None of the militiamen in the sprawling Baghdad slum could immediately be seen handing over their rocket-propelled grenade launchers or mortars but a surprise ceasefire ordered by Sadr on Monday has so far been observed.
But Sadr aide Naim al-Qaabi confirmed that handing over heavy weapons was part of an agreement being brokered between his movement and the Iraqi government, stressing however that no final deal had been reached.
Sadr's men fought US forces in the Shiite holy city of Najaf for most of August until backing down last week.

"5425",20061942,"Title: Explosions rock three Nepalese towns after communist rebels end cease-fire.rtf; Date: January 2, 2006, Monday, BC cycle; Text: A series of explosions rocked three towns in Nepal on Monday, hours after communist rebels said they were calling off a unilateral cease-fire, police and a government official said.
No casualties were immediately reported.
One explosion damaged a government building in Bhairahawa, about 175 miles southwest of the capital Katmandu. Another explosion hit a city council office in the nearby town of Butwal, according to the area's chief administrative officer.
Two explosions hit near a police station in Pokhara, a resort town about 125 miles west of Katmandu, a police officer there said on customary condition of anonymity.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosions, but they came hours after Maoist rebels announced they were ending their cease-fire and planned to resume attacks.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to replace the constitutional monarchy with a socialist state. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.
They declared a three-month cease-fire on Sept. 3 that they then extended by a month. On Monday the rebels said they felt compelled to end the cease-fire because the government refused to match their pledge. They had been widely expected to extend it again.
The government has refused to negotiate with the rebels, saying it is not convinced they are serious about ending the conflict. It has clashed sporadically with rebels during the cease-fire, and has referred to the militants as terrorists.
Under the cease-fire, the rebels pledged not to attack military or civilian targets but continued to block highways, extort money and kidnap villagers for indoctrination.
""We want to make it clear that we have been compelled to break the cease-fire to defend our fighters and resume offensives,"" said the rebel leader Prachanda, who goes by one name.
The rebel announcement came despite pleas by human rights groups and Nepali political parties.
The rebels agreed in November to work with the country's seven main political parties to step up their opposition to the administration of King Gyanendra, who seized control of the government in February 2005, citing the need to fight the insurgency and reduce corruption.
Gyanendra has suspended civil liberties, jailed hundreds of politicians and activists, and banned criticism of the government and security forces in the Hindu nation of about 27 million people.
Nepal's political parties blamed the government for forcing the rebels to end the cease-fire.
""The government provoked the rebels to break the peace. But we will continue to urge all parties to maintain peace,"" said Arjun Narsingh of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Nepal.
The government has set a tentative date next month for municipal elections, a step toward restoring democracy. But the political parties have pledged to boycott any vote under the king's rule.
Neighboring India, which has criticized Gyanendra for seizing absolute power, called the rebels' decision unfortunate.
""We have consistently called upon the Maoists to abandon the path of violence and terror, accept the discipline of multiparty democracy, and work for a political settlement that contributes to the political stability and economic prosperity of Nepal,"" said Navtej Sarna, spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs In New Delhi.

Supporters of several political parties waved their party flags and chanted, ""Restore democracy! Down with the king!"" in Ratna Park, as armed police commandeered trucks and used them to haul away protesters.
At least half a dozen protesters and policemen were injured in the protests as police used nightsticks to control the protesters, a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
The officer said 1,300 people were detained. Former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was among those arrested.
Human rights and civic groups, students and political parties have been staging protests since 2002 against King Gyanendra, who dismissed Parliament and the elected government and appointed a monarchist Cabinet.
The protests have increased in frequency during the past two weeks. Most demonstrators are released within a few hours, though some have been held under the Public Security Act, which allows them to remain in custody for up to three months.
Former Cabinet minister Ram Sharan Mahat addressed the gathering in the park, saying, ""The movement will defeat the autocratic and regressive regime and the people will be the winners ultimately.""
He and other leaders were surrounded by supporters and were able to escape arrest by going into nearby houses or blending into the crowd.
Without explanation, police detained 72 teachers administering examinations to students at a school near the park. They also detained 20 human rights activists staging a sit-in elsewhere in the city.
""We oppose the regressive king's takeover and support the movement of the political parties' to restore democracy,"" said Krishna Pahadi, chairman of the Human Rights and Peace Society, just before police arrested him.

 Kathmandu, 19 August: Maoist rebels shot dead two policemen, one of them sub-inspector, at a police post on the Mahendra Highway in Siraha District today afternoon, reports quoting police sources received here said. The police said that about 50 rebels shot dead SI Ganesh Prasad Dahal of Jhapa District and constable Shyam Narayan Yadav of Saptari District at a place called ""0 Mile"" on the Mahendra Highway.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 20 Aug 03
Meanwhile, the eastern regional bureau of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) today claimed that the army killed their cadre in cold blood in Ramechhap District. Altogether 19 Maoists were killed in the incident, which the army claims to be an encounter after the rebels ""ambushed"" them.
 In a statement signed by in-charge ""Kanchan"" received here, the rebels said that the army attacked the Maoists all of sudden when they had peacefully gathered at Doramba-2 for a discussion. While one of the rebels was killed on the spot, other 18 were taken to Dandakateri, one hour walk from Doramba, and shot in cold blood. ""We strongly condemn this barbaric and cowardly murder,"" said ""Kanchan"", adding it was part of the controversy to sabotage the peace talks. The rebels also said that the incident that occurred about 40 km from the district headquarters was a violation of the code of conduct and the agreement reached in the second round of peace talks by the rebels and the government.

 Jajarkot, 7 October: The lengthy and continuous blockade imposed by rebel Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) on the remote mountainous district of Jajrkot west Nepal has resulted in shortages of everyday basic necessities. Daily life in the district is becoming increasingly painful and hard.
 The shortages of basic needs arose after Maoists blockaded the district headquarters, Khalanga, since the first week of Bhadau two months ago . Goods and even people have been prohibited from entering Khalanga since then.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Oct 04
Rice, lentils, sugar, kerosene, oil, vegetables, chickens, goats and other such items are not available in Khalanga these days. Businessmen say that existing stocks have been depleted and, since they cannot be replenished, consumers are bearing the brunt. Business transactions have stopped, they say.
 Without any modern mode of transport, goods are transported on the backs of mules from Salli Bazaar and Shitalpati of Salyan. It takes two days to travel the route on foot and, since the Maoists have set up a ""base area"" en route, businessmen cannot bring in supplies. Farmers have not been able to sell their produce because of the blockade. This has created a situation where agricultural produce is going to waste and at the same time none of it is available in the district headquarters.
 The ban on transporting goats and chickens to the district headquarters from the villages has resulted in meat shortages. Maoists staying at various entry points of Khalanga have been sending people coming into the district headquarters back to their village, according to a villager who made it to Khalanga, on condition of anonymity. He said that, since a large number of Maoists were gathered in his village and meetings of the Maoist high command were taking place, they have been strictly implementing the blockade.
 Reports have said that Maoist military training has concluded in various places of Jajarkot recently.
 A statement signed by the chief of Maoist village people's government of Khalanga says that since his party is in the final phase of a centralized military offensive against the ""old regime"", it has banned the supply of milk, vegetables and other farm products to the leaders of the regime.
 Although there is no clear response as to why the blockade has been imposed, Maoists have demanded the release of six of their activists, including a village people's government chief, who were taken into custody by the security forces from Jagatipur of the district last month. No agency has so far taken any initiative towards lifting the embargo.
 ""Dashain major Hindu festival is nearing. Nothing is available on the market. Nobody appears to be concerned even during such a time,"" worries Prakash Karki of Khalanga-3.
 The blockade has affected even the postal services. Contact by individuals and organizations with the outside world have been lost with the absence of the only communications medium in the district. But the acting chief district officer Jhalakram Adhikari, claims that there will be no shortages during Dashain and says, ""We will provide supplies even if it means transporting the goods by helicopter.""
 Businessmen, civil servants, human rights activists, media persons and others have issued a joint statement calling on the Maoists to lift the blockade without delay.
 They have appealed to the Maoists to lift the prohibition of movement of goods and people with the Dashain in mind.

Speaking at an interaction with mediapersons here today, the party chairman Pashupati Samsher Rana said the big parties' lust for power and differences within their folds have overshadowed the key task of drafting the constitution.
Further, the RPP chief warned of a disaster if the parties fail to build a consensus.
Entering a different topic, Rana suspected that the Special Committee for the integration of Maoist combatants may find it hard to monitor the Maoist People's Liberation Army due to wayward ways of the UCPN-Maoist and lack of a specific plan to manage the fighters.
The Maoist party has lost its credibility by talking about a revolt even after joining the parliamentary system, Rana opined.
He took the occasion to remind the political parties that statute-drafting, not government formation, is the main agenda at present, lamenting that the three parties, engaged in internal disputes, had neglected the most important issue.
On the topic of state restructuring, Rana said formation of more than seven states will not be viable for the country. ''The state should be restructured respecting all ethnic groups, languages and communities,'' he concluded.

"5261",20066438,"Title: Security heightened in southwest Nepal following rebel attacks.rtf; Date: February 11, 2006 Saturday 5:31 AM GMT; Text: Security has been tightened in southwestern Nepal after communist rebels ambushed an army patrol on a key highway in the region, killing at least nine people and leaving 28 security forces missing, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of government troops have been transported to a stretch of the East-West highway near Sunwal, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of Katmandu, following the latest rebel assault, said Ram Kumar Khanal, the police chief in the area.
The Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for a decade to create a socialist state, have increased attacks since they pulled out of a cease-fire last month. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.
Khanal said two policemen were killed in clashes that began with Thursday's ambush and lasted through the next day. The Royal Nepalese Army said in a statement two army soldiers were also killed in the attack.
News reports on Saturday said 16 soldiers and police were killed.
Khanal said 22 soldiers and six policemen were missing and that land mines were hampering efforts to search for them.
The rebels said they lost at least four fighters in the battle. One civilian was also killed.
The fighting marred last week's nationwide municipal polls, Nepal's first elections in seven years.
King Gyanendra seized power a year ago, saying he needed to toss out an interim government to stamp out the rebellion and bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene. He promised to restore full democracy within three years, and said Wednesday's election was a first step.
The rebels launched repeated attacks during the campaign and threatened to kill anyone who took part in the elections. Two candidates were slain.
On Friday, Nepal's Election Commission announced that pro-government candidates, as expected, had won most of the elections for mayors and local officials. Three pro-government parties won 17 mayoral posts while independent candidates, none of whom are anti-king, won 15.
Only about 21 percent voters showed up for the elections, which were boycotted by major political parties who called it an attempt by the king to legitimize his power grab.
The elections have been rejected by key international allies as deeply flawed because of the boycott, rebel attacks and threats and government intimidation.

Both sides emerged from several hours of talks held in a Katmandu hotel, saying they had taken place in a ""cordial atmosphere.""
The Communist Party of Nepal, a Maoist group, has been waging a rebellion since 1996. More than 7,000 people have died in the fighting, the majority of them since the last attempt at talks broke down in 2001. The current cease-fire began in January after a series of back-channel communications were initiated on the order of the Himalayan kingdom's monarch, King Gyanendra.
The New York Times
The results of the meeting Sunday were mostly procedural. Two committees were set up to foster talks.
But in a news conference, the Maoists, led by their chief ideologue and negotiator, Baburam Bhattarai, said they had also presented their political demands to the government.
Among those demands is the creation of an interim government led by the Maoists, which would then conduct elections for a constituent assembly. Nepal became a multiparty democracy in 1990, but last October, the king replaced the elected prime minister with a caretaker prime minister of his choosing.
The Maoists said Sunday that the first step in the process should be a conference of all of the country's political forces. Their other demands whittled to 24 from an original 40 are diverse and far-ranging. They have demanded, for example, that centers where foreign armies recruit Gurkha soldiers be closed, saying they are a matter of ""national shame.""
They want the Royal Nepalese Army integrated with their forces, and they want Nepal, a Hindu kingdom, to become a secular nation. They have moderated their original demand for a republican state. On Sunday, Bhattarai said the status and role of the monarchy should be decided by the people.
He and his team also laid out a number of short-term demands. They want the repeal of what they consider draconian anti-terrorism laws, the withdrawal of criminal cases against them, the release of jailed comrades, and the return of the army to its barracks.
Insurgent groups in South Asia are increasingly finding themselves buffeted by the global war on terrorism. On Friday, the U.S. ambassador to Nepal, Michael Malanowski, signed a memorandum of intent to formalize and strengthen anti-terrorism aid to Nepal.
The government is also under pressure. The economy shrank by 0.6 percent in the fiscal year that ended in July. The Asian Development Bank is predicting growth of 1.5 percent this year, provided certain conditions, including maintenance of the truce, are met.

"1219",20032165,"Title: Maoist rebel leader calls for a cease-fire, agrees to peace talks.rtf; Date: January 29, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Maoist rebels and the Nepalese government agreed Wednesday to a cease-fire and peace talks to end nearly seven years of violence that has killed more than 7,000 people.
In a statement sent to news media Wednesday, Prachanda - the rebel leader whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal - said his group has decided to cease all offensive actions and would take part in peace talks.
""We received a notice yesterday from the government side notifying us that they have withdrawn the terrorist tag and price on our heads. We are considering this move a positive step and have decided to a cease-fire and agreed to take part in peace talks,"" said Prachanda.
Following the rebel statement, state-run Radio Nepal announced the government had agreed to a cease-fire and appointed Minister for Physical Planning Narayanman Singh Pun as negotiator to initiate peace talks.
The announcement, which quoted the prime minister's office, also said the government had agreed to stop calling the rebels terrorists, cancel the bounty offer on the heads of rebel leaders and cancel a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
""We have to resolve the differences between us through peace talks instead of violence,"" Minister for Information Ramesh Nath Pandey said.
Government officials refused to say when or where the talks would take place. Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand met with his Cabinet Wednesday at his residence to assess the situation, officials said.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began a violent campaign in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a socialist state in this Himalayan kingdom. The insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people.
Nepal's government has repeatedly offered to hold peace talks in the past but had never formally approached the rebels. The government covertly sent a message to the rebels on Tuesday, a government official said on condition of anonymity.
The rebel statement came hours after Maoist rebels allegedly attacked an army patrol in western Nepal, sparking a clash that killed three soldiers and 13 rebels.
The attack took place near Argabang village in Gulmi district, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, said Defense Ministry spokesman Bhupendra Poudel.
On Sunday, the chief of Nepal's Armed Police Force, his wife and his bodyguard were shot dead in an attack police have blamed on the guerrillas.
Clashes between government forces and rebels have intensified in recent months, with the army joining the police in a campaign to root out Maoist fighters from strongholds in remote mountainous areas.
King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency in November 2001 after the rebels broke a cease-fire and resumed attacks on government troops. The emergency was lifted last year but the fighting has continued.
During the last peace talks held in 2001, rebel negotiators and government ministers met three times. However, the rebels accused the government of failing to listen to them and being rigid during negotiations, and withdrew from the talks.
In the latest statement, Prachanda reiterated that the rebels wanted an interim government.
They are also demanding that voting be held to elect members to a constitutional assembly that would draft a new constitution.

"6541",20081675,"Title: Interpol issues worldwide security alert after escape of suspected terrorist.rtf; Date: February 29, 2008 Friday 7:25 AM GMT; Text: Interpol on Friday issued a worldwide security alert after a suspected Islamic terrorist leader escaped from a Singapore jail and triggered a manhunt across this usually well-policed island nation.
The government apologized for the security lapse after Mas Selamat Kastari who once allegedly plotted to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's international airport slipped away Wednesday.
The international police organization said it put out an ""Orange Notice"" on Mas Selamat, who is said to be commander of the Singapore arm of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group allied with al-Qaida.
Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said Mas Selamat escaped after being taken from his cell to go to a room for a scheduled visit by his family at the Whitley Road Detention Center, which is in a wooded residential area in central Singapore.
Mas Selamat, 47, was allowed to first go to the restroom and escaped from the heavily guarded facility, Wong said in Parliament, without offering any specifics.
""This should never have happened,"" said Wong, who is also deputy prime minister. ""I am sorry that it had. An independent investigation is under way and we should not speculate on what and how it happened.""
Security breaches are virtually unheard of in Singapore, a small and densely populated island whose sophisticated intelligence system has been liberally used to ensure order and safety in what is one of Asia's most prosperous financial and business centers.
The Interpol notice, which includes Mas Selamat's photograph and fingerprints, was issued to the group's 186 national member bureaus following a request by Singapore, the agency said in a statement on its Web site.
""Singapore is clearly doing all that it can on a national level to locate this fugitive and through issuing an Orange Notice, Interpol and all of its member countries can support these efforts on an international scale,"" Executive Director of Police Services Jean-Michel Louboutin was quoted as saying.
Among the Singapore security service's biggest successes was pre-empting alleged plots to bomb the U.S. Embassy, the American Club and government buildings in 2001 schemes in which Mas Selamat allegedly had a hand.
Singapore, a close ally of the United States, was named an al-Qaida target by Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 terror attack, according to a transcript of his Combatant Status Review Tribunal last year at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay.
The Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement that ""extensive police resources"" have been deployed to track down Mas Selamat, who walks with a limp.
Nepalese Gurkhas who guard the jail fanned out across a nearby snake-infested forest, checking vacant bungalows and peering down drains and back alleys of private housing areas.
Thousands of police officers and soldiers set up roadblocks to check passing cars. Dozens of riot police and military trucks parked along main roads.
Students arriving for class at a nearby girls' school were ushered through the gates by teachers and parents to an assembly hall where a school official told them ""not to roam around.""
Security was tightened at all of Singapore's land, air and sea entry ports, Wong said. It takes less than an hour to drive the length of the island and Indonesia and Malaysia are just short boat rides away.
Malaysia's police chief said his officers and border guards had been alerted to watch for Mas Selamat, who was being held under Singapore's Internal Security Act that allows indefinite detention without trial.
Indonesian security officials said they were prepared for the likelihood that Mas Selamat might attempt to come over.
Mas Selamat ""would think Indonesia is the safest place"" to hide out, said Nasir Abbas, a former Jemaah Islamiyah operative who now works closely with Indonesian police.
Associated Press writers Julia Zappei in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Chris Brummitt and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.

The lead speakers include Co-Founder of Afghanistan's Centre for Research and Policy Studies Mr Haroun Mir, and President, French National Crime Commission Mr Alain Bauer, besides security analysts from American think tank institutions like Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Centre for Strategic and International Studies. The deliberations would include presentations on Terrorism in South Asia and its neighbourhood and issues like Youth Radicalization and Extremism and Insurgency in South East Asia. A panel discussion on the India's experience in counter terrorism policing is scheduled for the second day. The IACP is the world's largest organisation of police officials, having a membership of around 20,000 officials, spread across more than 90 countries. Its objectives are to develop and disseminate professional practices and processes for policing law enforcement and to foster international cooperation amongst police or security organisations across the world in their fight against security threats such as terrorism, militant fundamentalism and organised crime. India presently chairs the Asia-Pacific World Regional Office of the IACP, and so is organising of the Seminar.

A single bench of judge Bal Krishna Upreti issued the order to produce Yunus Ansari, (who was targeted in the shooting) and Prakash Raj Sharma (policeman who filed the First Information Report of the shooting) to produce before it to record their statements.
The FIR had charged serial killer Charles Gurumukh Sobhraj, Manmeet Singh Bhatiya alias Bijaya Jasjit Singh Maya Mike and Amar Tandon in the March 10 shooting in a bid to kill chairman of National Television Ansari.
Police produced Sobhraj in the court today to record his statement where he denied any involvement and expressed hope to get a clean chit in UN backpacker Connie Jo Bronzich's murder case.
The Supreme Court is considering whether to accept his review petition produced a few weeks ago.
The government prosecutors had prosecuted Singh, Sobhraj and Tandon alleging their involvement in the jail shooting.
Singh had dodged three-tier security at the Central Jail before shooting at Ansari, a jailbird doing time on the charge of operating fake Indian currency racket and possessing drugs.
Singh had confessed to the officials that he was planning to shoot Ansari inside the jail premises on January 19, but changed the plan after security introduced metal detector a day before.

    Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, representing Nepal's  Seven-Party Alliance government, and CPN chairman Prachanda,  representing guerrilla, signed the comprehensive national peace  accord at the Birendra International Convention Centre (BICC) in  Kathmandu.
    In the presence of political leaders, foreign ambassadors,  dignitaries and members of the international press, the historic  moment came at 8:29 p.m. local time (GMT 1444) Tuesday.
    Before the signing, Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula read  out the entire text of the treaty in a packed convention hall,  which included the talks teams of the two sides, the entire  cabinet, ambassadors of various countries to Nepal, and media.
    The agreement signed Tuesday is divided into 10 sections, local himalayantimes.com reported. 
    The agreement does not give the king any right in the state  affairs. It nationalizes the king's property under various  national trusts and national parks. The agreement also decides to  convert the property of the late King Birendra into national  trusts.
    The CPN and the government have agreed to form three high-level commissions -- the National Peace and Rehabilitation Commission,  the Truth Commission, and the High-level Commission for State  Restructuring.
    The government and the CPN held many rounds of rigorous  negotiations to reach a consensus on the draft of the treaty,  which was originally scheduled to be signed on Nov. 16 as per an  agreement reached on Nov. 8.
    Coincidentally, Wednesday (Nov. 22) is the first anniversary of the formation of the first ever strategic alliance between the CPN and the seven-party alliance against the king after the king  assumed absolute powers through a bloodless military coup on Feb.  1, 2005.
    At least 13,000 people lost their lives after the CPN launched  an armed rebellion against the State in 1996. Thousands of  families have been displaced from their villages after the war  began.

"4678",20063526,"Title: GOVT BANS NON-IODISED SALT.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Hindustan Times
 New Delhi, Apr 25 -- After a delay of almost one year, the Central ban on the sale of non-iodised salt is likely to be reinstated finally from May 17.
 Announcing the re-introduction of the ban, lifted by the erstwhile BJP-led NDA government, Union Health Minister Dr Anbumani Ramadoss said the ban should have been in place by August 15, 2005. 
  However, bureaucratic process took six months. Another six months were required to implement the ban. ""Now it will come in force from May 17,"" said Dr C S Pandav, professor, community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here and one of the drivers behind the salt-iodisation drive. 
  With the support from UNICEF and the Indian Coalition for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), an alliance has been set up last week to advise the Union health ministry on salt iodisation programme. 
  A recent UNICEF survey showed that the number of households using iodised salt had increased to 57 per cent from the 2003 level of 37 per cent. The survey was conducted last December. 
 The increase in household percentage also indicates that an additional six million children were protected against iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). This will be in addition to the 13 million, out of 26 million born every year, who are protected against irreversible brain damage, dwarfism and depleted productivity levels. Interestingly, prominent IDDs like goitre and cretinism account for only between one to 10 per cent of all disorders, most of which remain hidden. 
  ""In Bhutan almost all new born babies are protected. In China, the coverage is 93 per cent. Bangladesh and Nepal also fare well with 70 and 63 per cent respectively,"" said Cecilio Adorna, Indian representative to the UNICEF. 
  Only 49 per cent Indians used adequately iodised salt, whose number came down to 37 per cent after the ban on non-iodised salt was lifted in 2003, Dr Pandav said.

"2196",20043509,"Title: Joint inquiry starts into Iranian plane crash in UAE.rtf; Date: February 11, 2004 Wednesday; Text: Aviation experts from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran on Wednesday began investigating what caused an Iranian Kish Airlines plane to crash without warning in the UAE, killing 43 people on board.
""Experts from the Iranian Civil Aviation Authority started their inquiry this morning with representatives of the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority,"" the head of Sharjah's civil aviation authority, Abdul Wahab Mohammed al-Roomi, told AFP.
The Fokker 50 twin-turboprop aircraft crashed Tuesday as it was coming in to land in Sharjah, leaving just three survivors out of the 46 people on board as it narrowly missed a residential area before plunging to the ground.
""A representative of Sharjah's civil aviation authority took part in the meeting,"" said Roomi. He added that ""the number of crash victims has not changed,"" while providing a revised list of the passengers' nationalities.
Roomi also identified the survivors as an Iranian, an Egyptian and a Filipino, noting that ""their condition is slightly better."" Two of them were stable while the third was still in critical condition, he said.
Iranian airport authorities provided a new passenger list, he said, identifying those on board as 16 Iranians, including the six crew members, 13 Indians, four Egyptians, two Algerians, four Filipinos, one Bangladeshi, one Cameroonian, two Nepalese, one Kenyan, one Sudanese and one UAE national.
""The Iranian delegation has visited the wounded and the inquiry commission has not allowed journalists to speak to them,"" said Roomi.
""Sharjah's civil aviation authority has set up three hotlines for the victims' families to enquire about their loved ones and has reserved a room at the airport for the victims' relatives,"" Roomi said.
""Many of the relatives were contacted by Sharjah police to repatriate the bodies, some of which are burnt and others difficult to identify,"" he added.
""We have handed over the two black boxes, which are in a very good state, to the Emirates civil aviation authority, the only official body authorised to investigate aircraft accidents,"" said Roomi, referring to the plane's flight recorders.
He insisted that the control tower at Sharjah international airport did not receive any distress signal from the plane, either verbal or coded.
Soon after the crash, an official Iranian civil aviation authority statement, quoted by the student news agency ISNA, indicated there might have been a problem on the final approach.
""This morning a Fokker 50 aircraft of Kish Air left the airport of Kish for Sharjah. Near the airport (of Sharjah) it asked to make an emergency landing, veered to the left and crashed,"" the statement said.
The flight had come from Iran's Gulf island of Kish when it went down in an open area sandwiched between the villas of a crowded residential zone about two miles (nearly four kilometres) from the airport, on the border between Sharjah and Ajman, another emirate in the seven-member UAE federation.
Kish Airlines operates daily flights across the Gulf and is used particularly by Iranian tourists and Asian workers who have to leave the Emirates briefly to obtain new visas.
The president of the United Arab Emirates, Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, issued an order Wednesday stating that all those in the UAE on visit visas will no longer have to leave the country in order to renew them or convert them to residence visas, the official WAM news agency reported.
Applicants would pay a fee, to be fixed later, rather than have to fly out for a day in order to change their status.
On September 6, one of Kish Airlines' three-jet Tupolev 154Ms of Soviet origin crashed after hitting a tree when it tried to land in heavy fog at Minsk, Belarus, but none of the nearly 40 people aboard were injured, according to airport authorities at the time.
Aircraft accidents are frequent in Iran, whose commercial planes are comprised mainly of Boeings that are old and not well maintained. Tehran blames this on US sanctions imposed on Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

  In a daring incident on November 13, rebels entered Jehanabad town in small groups, cut off power and raided the prison in one of the biggest ever attacks by Maoist guerrillas. The rebels, who were estimated to number 700, killed a prison guard and a member of a private army of upper caste landlords in a gun-battle. 
  The guerrillas also abducted at least two dozen members of the Ranvir Sena, the private army of upper caste landlords, who were jail inmates. The rebels, who operate in eastern and southern India, say they are fighting for the rights of landless labourers and impoverished peasants. In Bihar, they often clash with private armies of landlords. Dozens have been killed in the past decade.
  It is estimated that there are around about 9,300 armed Maoist rebels in the country and says they have links with Maoist insurgents in neighboring Nepal who are fighting to overthrow the Himalayan nation's monarchy.

"6274",20073707,"Title: UN _ Vietnamese Prefer Boys Over Girls.rtf; Date: October 31, 2007 Wednesday 5:26 PM GMT; Text: Vietnam's preference for boys over girls is further tipping the balance between the sexes in Asia, already skewed by a strong bias for boys among Chinese and Indians. The trend could lead to increased trafficking of women and social unrest, a U.N. report says.
Vietnam is now positioned where China was a decade ago, logging about 110 boys born to every 100 girls in a country where technology is readily available to determine the sex of a fetus and where abortion is legal, according to research released this week by the U.N. Population Fund.
The sex ratio at birth generally should equal about 105 boys to 100 girls, according to the report.
""The consequences are already happening in neighboring countries like China, South Korea and Taiwan. They have to import brides,"" said Tran Thi Van, assistant country representative of the Population Fund in Hanoi, adding that many brides are coming from Vietnam. ""I don't know where Vietnam could import brides from if that situation happened here in the next 10 or 15 years.""
The report, which looked at China, India, Vietnam and Nepal, warned that tinkering with nature's probabilities could cause increased violence against women, trafficking and social tensions. It predicted a ""marriage squeeze,"" with the poorest men being forced to live as bachelors.
Gender imbalance among births has been rising in parts of Asia since the 1980s, after ultrasound and amniocentesis provided a way to determine a fetus' sex early in pregnancy. Despite laws in several countries banning doctors from revealing the baby's sex, many women still find out and choose to abort girls.
""I have noticed that there have been more and more boys than girls,"" said Truong Thi My Ha, a nurse at Hanoi's Maternity Hospital. ""Most women are very happy when they have boys, while many are upset if they have girls.""
In China, the 2005 estimate was more than 120 boys born to 100 girls, with India logging about 108 boys to 100 girls in 2001, when the last census was taken. However, pockets of India have rates of 120 boys. In several Chinese provinces, the ratio spikes to more than 130 boys born to 100 girls.
Reports of female infanticide still surface in some poor areas of countries and death rates are higher among girls in places like China, where they are sometimes breast-fed for shorter periods, given less health care and vaccinations and even smaller portions of food than their brothers, the report said.
It estimated Asia was short 163 million females in 2005 when compared to overall population balances of men and women elsewhere in the world. It said sex ratios at birth in other countries, such as Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh, also should be closely monitored to avoid uneven trends there.
Earlier research has documented the gender imbalance in the region. A UNICEF report last year estimated 7,000 girls go unborn every day in India.
""It's very difficult to imagine what's going to be the exact impact of these missing girls in 20 years,"" said Christophe Guilmoto, an author of the report presented this week at a reproductive health conference in Hyderabad, India. ""No human society that we know has faced a similar problem.""
The reasons boys are favored over girls are complex and deeply rooted in Asian society. In many countries, men typically receive the inheritance, carry on the family name and take care of their parents in old age, while women often leave to live with their husband's family.
In India, wedding costs and dowries are usually required of the parents of the bride, and sons are the only ones permitted by the Hindu religion to perform the last rites when their fathers die.
""My husband took me to a private clinic to be checked. I broke down in tears when I saw the result because I knew this is not what my husband wanted,"" said Nguyen Thi Hai Yen, 33, recalling when she discovered her second baby was a girl. ""But he was good. He told me it was OK.""
China has a one-child policy, while Vietnam encourages only two children per family after relaxing an earlier ban on having more. Such limits have led many women to abort girls and keep trying for sons who can carry on the family lineage.
The report calls for increased public awareness, more government intervention and steps to elevate women's place in society by promoting gender equality.

 Kathmandu, 1 September: The prospect of the stirring five political parties being isolated by the pro-democracy international community has increased if parties do not withdraw their proposed nationwide stir in the prevailing situation after cease-fire, beginning Thursday 4 September; i.e. the round of their protest campaign due to start that day .
 Although agreeing in principle with the spirit of the parties' agitation against king's ""regressive moves"", the international community has urged the parties to postpone their stir in view of infiltration by the Maoists and subsequent violence.
 The ambassadors of India, the USA and the UK are believed to have urged the leaders to hold dialogue with King Gyanendra after his return from a medical check-up in Britain.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 2 Sep 03
While the ambassadors of the US and the UK met Nepali Congress President G.P. Koirala yesterday and CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal last week, their Indian counterpart met Koirala today. The envoys were of the view that the parties and the institution of constitutional monarchy should get united in finding solutions to the problems unitedly.
 Meanwhile, informed sources revealed that the ambassadors of US and the UK met PM Thapa and stressed upon him not to increase the rift with the parties.
 The ambassador duo impressed upon the PM that if the difference with the stirring parties was not resolved, it would only help the Maoists.
 The sources also said that the government is believed to have been told by domestic as well as international intelligence units about the possible presence of RDX explosive and sharpshooters in Kathmandu with the aim of infiltrating the protest and causing mass destruction. Both the government as well as the diplomats have shared this information with the leaders of political parties, pointing out that they have to own responsibility for any resultant violence and anarchy.

"297",20032349,"Title: Nepal 's king wants to prevent _summer of discontent_.rtf; Date: May 8, 2003 Thursday; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra has said he is working to prevent a ""summer of discontent"" as political parties Thursday launched a movement against the monarchy.
Five political parties, who are protesting against the king's sacking of the elected prime minister in October, said they were beginning a campaign of street protests.
About 1,000 party activists gathered in Kathmandu to pay tribute to those who died in the 1990 struggle to introduce constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy.
Gyanendra said he was not opposed to granting a collective audience to the leaders of the political parties to resolve the stand-off.
""The political parties should put forth their demands clearly,"" he told the Kathmandu Post and other newspapers.
""The most important thing that we should remember is that this is no time to heat up the streets.
""Given the work at hand, all of us should contribute from our respective domains of duty towards making this period a summer of content, not a summer of discontent.""
The home ministry Thursday issued a warning to the political parties.
""If anyone tries to act against the constitution, to defame anybody or obstruct public life and threaten people's peace and security, strong action will be taken,"" said a ministry statement.
Gyanendra, who also indefinitely postponed elections, appointed an interim government headed by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a staunch royalist, infuriating the political parties who said his move was unconstitutional.
But Gyanendra denied that he was now the real power centre in the Himalayan kingdom and reiterated his commitment to multi-party democracy and constitutional monarchy.
""The state executive power has long been shifted to the government,"" he said.
The campaign by the five parties -- the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist Leninist (NCP-UML), Nepali Congress (NC), Nepal Peasants and Workers Party, People Front-Nepal (PF-N) and a factional group of the Nepal Goodwill Party (NGP) -- is also being supported by Maoist rebels, who are currently engaged in peace talks with the government.
""We are determined to launch a five parties' united movement until the king agrees to correct his mistakes either by forming an all-party government after meeting with us collectively or reinstalling the parliament, which was dissolved â¦ last year,"" said NCP-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal.

Text of report by Muhammad Ahmad Noorani headlined ""Nepal denies Ajmal Kasab's arrest, handing over to India"" published by Pakistani newspaper The News website on 21 December
Islamabad: Nepalese Ambassador to Pakistan Bala B Kunwar on Saturday said that one of the Mumbai attackers, Ajmal Kasab, was never arrested or kidnapped from Nepal before 2006. 
Addressing a press conference, the high commissioner of Nepal said, ""Ajmal Amir Kasab, a Pakistani national, was never arrested or kidnapped in Nepal before 2006."" 
The Nepalese high commissioner termed the report of kidnapping or arrest of Kasab in Nepal as baseless, saying Nepal as a sovereign and responsible state had always adhered to its stated policy of not allowing its territory to be used against the interest of other countries. 
The Nepalese high commissioner on Saturday admitted that there was no visa restriction in Nepal for the Indian nationals and that they could come and go any time from any sector of the country. 
The Nepalese ambassador also frankly admitted that as Nepalese visas to Pakistani citizens were being issued from Islamabad and Karachi, besides on arrival in Kathmandu, therefore, it was very difficult to trace the record of arrival of any Pakistani citizen in the name of Ajmal Amir Kasab. 
APP adds: The Nepalese ambassador said he was confident that such charges (of arrest and hand over of Kasab to India) would have no adverse impact whatsoever on the warm and friendly ties that existed between the governments and peoples of Nepal and Pakistan. 
To a question, he said there were a number of Pakistanis in Nepalese jails, while there were a number of Nepalese in the Pakistani jails. 
The ambassador said the policy to issue visas to Pakistanis after this report would not be changed, adding that visas of Nepal would be issued to Pakistani citizens as per the previous rules without any verification and investigation. 
He said there was no visa for Indian nationals and they could come and go any time from any sector of the country. 
The ambassador also refuted the report that the lawyer representing Ajmal Amir Kasab was arrested in Nepal. He assured that the Nepalese government would extend full cooperation and assistance to the lawyer in finding the facts of the case.

Brig. Gen. Sagar Pandey is the highest army officer to be killed by the rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to end the monarchy in this Himalayan kingdom.
Pandey and three soldiers riding in the same vehicle were killed near Bhaise, a town about 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Katmandu, the ministry said in a brief statement.
It did not give any more details.
Separately, three policemen were fatally shot by suspected rebels in the middle of a busy market in southern Nepal.
The policemen were killed in Nepalgunj, a city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu. It is the regional headquarters of Nepal's western region, the hardest hit by the insurgency.
Four men on motorcycles shot the policemen at point-blank range and fled under the cover of darkness, police said.
Although the market was crowded, no civilians were injured in the firing.
Police officials said they suspect the rebels were responsible for the killings.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the insurgents pulled out of peace talks in August, ending a seven-month cease-fire. At least 1,200 people have died in the recent fighting.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.
More than 8,200 people have been killed since the insurgency began.

Mahabir Rai, a civilian and former-member of a local elected body in the southern Sunsari district was kidnapped Friday and shot dead, police said.
Meanwhile, three armed rebels entered the Nepal SBI bank in the western Pokhara town on Thursday and forced members of staff to open a safe.
They took all the cash inside before fleeing the scene. No one has been arrested in connection with the robbery.
Pokhara, which is 225 kilometres (140 miles) west of Kathmandu, is popular with tourists and has been relatively free from Maoist-related incidents.
Police sources said a group of Maoists set a hotel on fire in the Gainda Wildlife Park in the Sauraha area of the southern Chitwan district.
They ordered the guests, including foreign tourists, out first.
No one was injured, but two German travellers lost their luggage, including their passports.
Also in Chitwan, a group of armed guerrillas kidnapped Mayor Nanda Prasad Bhattarai and Deputy Mayor Rudra Dhakal of Ratna Nagar municipality early Friday morning, a police source said.
The government recently nominated mayors, deputy mayors and other officials in 49 of the kingdom's 58 municipalities.
Most of the appointments were from the ruling Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP).
A Maoist source said Bhattarai and Dhakal had announced their resignations from their posts while in captivity and so would be released soon.
The rebels also detonated powerful bombs at five places in the northeastern Nuwakot district on Thursday but no one was injured.
There has been a surge in violence in Nepal since an eight-day ceasefire, called by the rebels to mark the Hindu kingdom's most important festival, Dasain, ended last week.
A total of 191 people have been reported killed since the end of the truce, dashing hopes that the holiday peace could restart efforts to find a political solution to the Maoist insurrection.
The rebels pulled out of a seven-month ceasefire and peace talks in August after the government refused to set up a special assembly to re-draft the constitution.
The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 8,200 lives, according to government figures.

Excerpt from report by Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency
New Delhi 17 June: The Interpol has issued a red corner notice against two Chinese nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of a close aide of the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and two of his students in 1997 in a suspected fallout of a sectarian dispute.
The red corner notice was issued against Lobsang Chodak and Tenzin Chozin for allegedly killing Lobsang Gyatso, principal of the Dharamsala-based Tibetan Dialectics Institute, and his two students in 1997, an incident that prompted security agencies to tighten the security around the Dalai Lama and monitor the monk traffic from Nepal and other areas.
The dead were members of the inner circle of the Dalai Lama and brutally slain on the night of 4 February 1997, in a bedroom a few hundred yards from the Dalai Lama's residence in exile in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh.
The body of 70-year-old Gyatso was found the next morning and the two young monks - Nagawang Lodoe and the Dalai Lama's Chinese-language interpreter Lobsang Nagwang - died within hours of the attack.
According to the Interpol red corner notice, the two alleged assailants, who are students of ""Dorje Shugden devotees charitable and religious society"", arrived in Dharamshala on 31 January and stayed in a hotel.
The Dorje Shugden cult, also known Gyalchen Shugden, indulges in the worship of a spirit called Dolgyal, a practice that has not been accepted by the Dalai Lama who has stated that the ""inclination of this (Dolgyal) spirit is to harm, rather than benefit the cause of Tibet"".
This cult has offices in, among other places, Italy and Britain where it operates under the banner of the Shugden Supporters Community. Its Indian headquarters is in Delhi's Majnu-ka-Tilla area from where its coordinates the activities of its fundamentalist followers. [Passage omitted: details of the case]

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Evan Feigenbaum, met Prachanda, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), and his deputy Baburam Bhattarai in Katmandu on Monday.
""The official assured us that the U.S. will continue their cooperation,"" Prachanda, who uses only one name, told reporters after the meeting. ""We assured them we are going to make the peace process successful and establish democracy.""
The former rebels won the largest number of seats in elections last month for a constitution-drafting assembly and are set to lead the new government. The assembly is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, following which a new government is expected to be formed.
Prachanda said Feigenbaum told the Maoists that the U.S. was in the process of removing them from a U.S. terrorist list, but Washington remained concerned about continued reports of violence by the Maoists' youth wing called Young Communist League.
U.S. Ambassador to Nepal Nancy Powell met Prachanda earlier this month in the first meeting between a U.S. official and the leader of the Maoists, who abandoned their 10-year armed revolt and joined a national peace process in 2006.

District police filed the case Monday at a court in Patan on Kathmandu's outskirts, charging that the 21 Maoists masterminded the killing of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, the highest-level official assassinated since the insurgency began in 1996.
The police asked for life imprisonment for 18 senior Maoists including the rebels' top leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- known by the alias Prachanda (The Fierce) -- and Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoist negotiator in failed peace talks this year.
Under Nepalese law, a life term requires at least 20 years in prison. The kingdom does not have the death penalty.
Police called for 10 years in prison each for three lesser-ranking Maoists, Krishna Hari Sainju, Seeta Karanjit and Kamal Bista.
Shrestha, his wife Regmi and his bodyguard Surya Regmi were gunned down January 26 as they went on a morning walk in Lalitpur on Kathmandu's outskirts. The Maoists claimed responsibility for the killings.
The assassination sent shockwaves through Nepal's political circles and three days later the government reached a ceasefire with the Maoists.
But three rounds of peace talks failed to yield a breakthrough and the rebels ended the ceasefire on August 27 after the government refused to convene a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
Prachanda rarely makes public appearances and Bhattarai, who moved openly in Kathmandu during the truce, went back underground before the Maoists withdrew from the peace process.
Since the breakdown of the truce, the government has declared the Maoists a terrorist organization, which would allow security forces to arrest rebel leaders. The terrorist label was lifted as a goodwill gesture during the ceasefire.
Other prominent Maoists charged over Shrestha's killing include Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa.
The Armed Police Force was created under Shrestha's leadership to combat the Maoists after the rebels broke an earlier truce in November 2001 with a flurry of attacks on often ill-prepared local police.
The Maoists' seven-year insurgency aimed at overthrowing the monarchy has claimed more than 7,900 lives, according to government figures. Officials have reported 138 deaths since the breakdown of the latest truce.

The foreign secretaries head the standing committee of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) -- a regional grouping founded in 1985 comprising India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
Over the past decade, SAARC heads-of-state summits have become a favoured hunting ground for India and Pakistan to rake up bilateral disputes over Kashmir.
The 12th SAARC summit was set for Islamabad in January but was put off due to hostilities between the neighbours.
Pakistan indefinitely postponed the summit after India failed to confirm participation. India accused Pakistan of reneging on past resolutions from such summits to boost economic ties in the region.
Since the January postponement, however, dramatic changes have unfolded on the subcontinent.
On April 18, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee offered a surprise ""hand of friendship"" to Pakistan, ending a 17-month deadlock following a militant attack on the Indian parliament that brought the two countries close to war.
The offer was fully reciprocated by Pakistan with President Pervez Musharraf hailing it as a ""good beginning.""
Since the renewed peace initiatives, the two countries have appointed new envoys and are set to revive air, train and bus links.
India has said it has a ""roadmap"" for dialogue with Pakistan which it will follow step-by-step. It has, however, ruled out any summit between Vajpayee and Musharraf before year's end.
The summit, New Delhi says, will ""be the last step.""
In this changed atmosphere, the Indian and Pakistan foreign secretaries will get an opportunity to share the same round-table when they meet in the Nepalese capital to decide on dates for the 12th SAARC summit.
The heads-of-state summit is likely to be held in Pakistan -- as originally planned -- and if the dates are finalised, it would be the first opportunity for Vajpayee and Musharraf to face each other since the thaw in bilateral ties.
Indian government sources said, however, there is only a slim chance of the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan meeting on the sidelines of the Kathmandu meeting.
Chances of a face-to-face between Vajpayee and Musharraf at a SAARC summit are even more remote, they said.
India, the sources said, will follow the path of a ""composite dialogue"" that involves prolonged discussions at the official level not just on Kashmir but also on seven other bilateral disputes.
The last such ""composite dialogue"" was held in 1997 and was led by foreign secretaries of both sides. It is this dialogue that India would seek to revive, at the end of which Vajpayee and Musharraf could shake hands, sources said.

""The families of these missing persons suffer intolerably from not knowing what has happened to their loved ones, and they have the right to know,"" said Mary Werntz, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Nepal.
The Swiss-based humanitarian group compiled the list of 812 people after conducting months of interviews with family members of those who had been taken by either former rebel Maoists or security forces, Werntz said.
""There is a larger percentage of those (812) cases that were allegedly under the responsibility of the security forces,"" said Werntz, who declined to reveal detailed information about who was responsible for taking those missing.
Both the former rebels and security forces have been accused by rights groups of serious abuses, including abduction, murder and torture, during the bitter civil war.
The Red Cross urged Nepal's government to follow up on commitments made in the November peace deal to end a conflict that has claimed at least 13,000 lives.
The peace deal between the former rebels and mainstream political parties called for the establishment of an independent commission to look at the cases of those who remain missing.
""The establishment of this commission in now necessary in order for the government to make progress in addressing this issue,"" said Werntz.
The Red Cross will publish the names and details of those still missing on Thursday and has called on communities across Nepal to add to the list if they have names.
""We do not claim this list is necessarily comprehensive. We know from other conflict situations that once there is peace, normally the numbers (of missing people) increases slightly,"" Werntz said.
Nepal's Maoists are poised to enter government after the peace deal last year.
In January, they were granted 83 seats in a new 330-seat parliament, and in return have nearly completed the initial stage of registering their weapons and army with the United Nations.

KATHMANDU, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite some solace from international media that honored Nepal as one of the few outbound destinations with exotic natural beauties, the year 2002 proved to be one of the most painful years for Nepali tourist industry.
Two international airlines canceled services to Nepal, significant number of tourism dependants turned jobless and total tourist arrivals hit rock-bottom in 2002.
According to statistics of Nepal Tourism Board, the total number of tourists visiting Nepal in 2002 decreased by 28 percent compared with that in 2001. Altogether 215,922 visitors from different parts of the world came to Nepal by air in 2002, while the figure in the previous year stood at 298,456.
Nepali tourist industry's traditional markets such as the United States, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands got declines of 4 percent, 18 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent respectively.  The number of tourists from China also decreased by 21 percent.
The total tourist arrivals from the countries other than India recorded a heavy decline of 36 percent from 234,256 to 150,293, the sharpest decline in recent years.
Nepali tourist industry had recorded a similar decline in the total tourist arrivals during the previous year also. The number of tourists plunged by 20.7 percent in 2001 compared with the figure in 2000.
Most of the tourist entrepreneurs in Nepal blame the declining of tourism on political instability and security problems, especially the anti-government insurgents' violence.
The year 2002 witnessed a total of 39 days of insurgent-called ""bandh"" (strikes), including 15 days of nationwide general strikes and 17 days of educational strikes throughout the kingdom.
""The bandhs are suicidal for Nepal's ailing tourist and hospitality industry and even cause the two reeling industries to collapse. Nepal's image in the international market has also further deteriorated,"" complained Narendra Bajracharya, president of the Hotel Association of Nepal.
On the other hand, tourist entrepreneurs believe that there are other factors responsible for the decline of the tourist industry.
The quality of service, regular flight services and new places for trekking, rafting and travelling also have to be given priority, if Nepal is to revive its tourist industry, said Aditya Baral, publicity manager of Nepal Tourism Board.
With an aim to come up with new measures to boost the ailing tourism sector, the Nepali government has announced a two-year Destination Nepal Campaign in 2002 and 2003. ""But the government's inadequate homework led to the delay in real launching of the program,"" Baral noted.
""Lack of budget has been the major constraint to publicize Nepal's full potential in adventure, trekking and mountaineering,"" he explained, adding ""Anyhow, quality service is one of the main points for the revival of Nepal's tourist industry.""

About 500 Tibetans, many of them women, marched on the outskirts of Katmandu for about three kilometers (two miles), holding banners that said ""Free Tibet, Tibet for Tibetans.""
Police at first tried to detain some of them, but after scuffles lasting several minutes the protesters returned to their refugee camp at the southern edge of Katmandu. No-one was arrested.
Tibetans have been protesting almost daily in front of the Chinese embassy and United Nations since March 10 against Chinese crackdown in Tibet. Friday's march, however, was far from their usual site of protest.
Nepal's police have broken up almost all anti-China protests by Tibetan exiles during the past several weeks and detained participants. Officials say they will not allow protests that could harm Nepal's friendly relations with neighboring China.
The United Nations and international rights groups have criticized Nepal for using what they say is excessive force to stop the protests. Police have beaten people with batons and dragged them through the streets while detaining them.

The rebels said they had given the new cabinet a ""code of conduct"" outlining the rules they want to see followed in the wake of ceasefires declared by the Maoists and the government in the Himalayan kingdom.
""We are studying the Maoist code of conduct. Once the government reaches an agreement a committee will be formed to begin dialogue,"" Ram Sharan Mahat, finance minister told AFP Friday.
The minister gave no indication of when peace talks might begin.
After three weeks of mass protests by seven opposition parties in concert with rebel Maoists, Nepal's King Gyanendra finally handed back power to parliament last week, after ruling the country directly for 14 months.
Gyanendra sacked the government in February 2005, saying that they were corrupt and had failed to stem a bloody Maoist insurgency that has claimed 12,500 lives in the impoverished Himalayan nation.
Once bitter enemies, the ousted political parties formed a loose alliance with the rebels last November, isolating Gyanendra -- the world's sole Hindu monarch.
A new cabinet was appointed Tuesday but squabbling has already begun in the alliance of political parties.
A senior leader from Nepal's second largest party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), told AFP that the new government should be scrapped after the first round of talks and then reformed to include the rebels.
""This present government should be dissolved and an interim government set up that includes Maoists before the constituent assembly. This is in our seven party alliance road map,"" said the party's Jhalanath Khanal.
On Wednesday, the newly reinstated government called a ceasefire, matching an earlier one called by the rebels and urged the Maoists to enter peace talks.
The rebels welcomed the move and agreed to join peace talks. Their demand for the election of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution was met by the new government.
The new constitution is expected to clip the powers of the king and sever his control of the 90,000 strong Royal Nepalese Army (RNA).
The rebel leader said that he was willing to have the People's Liberation Army integrated with the RNA to form a new national army under civilian control.
""We are entering into a dialogue process, feeling deep responsibility for people's aspirations towards democracy and peace,"" said the rebel chief Prachanda, or ""the fierce one.""
""We hope that the peace talks will not fail this time.""
It is the third time that the government and rebels have called ceasefires at the same time and tried to start peace talks, but on previous occasions negotiations broke down and the country plunged back into conflict.

"2240",20043306,"Title: Two soldiers killed, 10 hurt in land mine blast in Nepal.rtf; Date: March 4, 2004 Thursday; Text: An army truck hit a landmine planted by suspected Maoist rebels in eastern Nepal on Thursday, triggering a blast that killed at least two soldiers and injured 10 others, officials said.
The convoy of six trucks was returning from the regional command center when the first vehicle hit the mine at Sarlahi, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Katmandu.
Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were investigating the explosion but claimed that Maoist rebels had planted the device.
The injured have been taken to hospitals, they said, adding that soldiers have sealed off the highway, disrupting traffic on one of the main routes in the eastern part of this Himalayan nation.
The officials also blamed the rebels for several explosions overnight at Nepalgunj, a city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of Katmandu. There were no reports of injuries. The region has been the hardest hit by the insurgency.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The eight-year insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
The fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August.
