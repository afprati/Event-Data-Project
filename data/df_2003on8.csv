Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 4 January
Rolpa, 4 January: The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) Tuesday [3 January] halted its Rolpa operation and returned to district headquarters. 
In an attempt to flush the Maoist guerrillas out of their hideouts, the RNA had begun a massive operation in the villages of Rolpa, one of the Maoist strongholds, a week ago.
The rebels on Monday cited RNA's Rolpa operation as one of the reasons for ending their ceasefire. Sources said an RNA team returned to Gorakhgan barracks at district headquarters on Sunday, before the Maoist ceasefire ended.
The sources said the RNA teams from the adjoining districts of Dang, Salyan, Rukum and Baglung have converged on a village north of Rolpa district.
The RNA last week organized a massive operation in Bhawang and Thawang areas of Rolpa, considered as one of the rebel strongholds.
RNA sources said they did not encounter any Maoist in the area but they collected a cache of explosives and logistic materials.

"744",20031264,"Title: Singapore doctors boosted by success with South Korean twins.rtf; Date: July 23, 2003 Wednesday; Text: A pioneering medical team said here Wednesday its morale had been lifted by the successful separation of conjoined South Korean baby girls after a failed operation killed two Iranian adult twins earlier this month.
For neurosurgeon and team co-leader Keith Goh especially, Tuesday's operation on four-month-old Min Ji-Hye and Min Sa-Rang did wonders for the spirits of staff at Raffles Hospital who two weeks ago had to deal with the deaths of Laleh and Ladan Bijani.
""I think it speaks wonders for the spirits of our team,"" Goh told a news conference as the Korean girls, previously joined at the pelvic area, were recovering, with specialists giving them good chances to lead normal lives.
Putting the team together so soon after the July 8 deaths of the Bijanis allowed them to ""rally the troops so to speak,"" Goh said, adding that the team spirit was ""very heartwarming for me personally.""
Goh, who led the failed attempt to separate the 29-year-old Bijani twins who were joined at the head, said he had been asked several times if he would be able to take part in a similar operation so soon after the death of the Iranian sisters.
""That's a question which many people have asked me over the last two weeks but as doctors, you know we often are faced with difficult situations where we don't have a choice,"" Goh said.
It was also difficult to reject the parents of Ji-Hye and Sa-Rang who had returned to the Singapore hospital after seeking a second opinion from experts in London, Goh said.
""If you had seen the pictures of the babies that were released … by the parents, you would see that they are joined in such as way that their lower spines have to be curved in order than they can lie down,"" he said.
""I think there are already signs that the abnormal positon they are in has resulted in quite a few deformities,"" he said, citing the flattening of the backs of the Korean girls' skulls.
""In four months, these changes are already evident and it's clear because of these we could not delay surgery any longer,"" Goh said.
The multi-disciplinary team of 16 specialists, including Goh, waived their fees for the five-and-a-half hour operation which cost about 50,000 Singapore dollars (28,571 US dollars) excluding post-surgical rehabilitation.
""The medical team decided to waive the fees because obviously although we are (a) private hospital, there are certain things we want to do,"" said the hospital's chairman Loo Choon Yong.
""These are challenging surgeries … just like Laleh and Ladan, they needed help … and all the doctors together came forward to help,"" he said.
Fifty medical support staff assisted the specialists in the operation.
Goh had also led a team in the successful surgery to separate a pair of 11-month-old Nepalese twins joined at the head, Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, on April 10, 2001, after 97 hours of surgery at another hospital.
Early this month the Bijani sisters had insisted on being separated despite repeated warnings that one or both of them could die.
They succumbed to massive blood loss within 90 minutes of each other after their skulls and brains were separated by Goh's team.

 Kathmandu, 4 April: Fresh clashes have broken out between supporters of the five political parties and the police for the third consecutive day Sunday 4 April .
 The clashes erupted after thousands of political activists, led by senior leaders, tried to breach the police barricade at Bhotahiti and Ratna Park at about 4.30 p.m. 1045 gmt today.
Kantipuronline.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Apr 04

"6569",20084022,"Title: 30 killed when 2 strong quakes hit Tibet.rtf; Date: October 6, 2008 Monday 7:02 PM GMT; Text: Two earthquakes jolted the capital of Tibet and surrounding areas Monday, killing more than 30 people and collapsing hundreds of houses, China's state news agency said. Rescuers rushed in to try to save people buried in the rubble.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake measured magnitude 6.6 and struck at 4:30 p.m. (0830 GMT) 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Lhasa, more than 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) from Beijing.
The second temblor measuring magnitude 5.1 hit about 15 minutes later, some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the Tibetan capital, it said.
Thirty people died and hundreds of houses collapsed in Gedar township near the epicenter in Dangxiong County, and traffic and telecommunications were cut. An unknown number of people were trapped, and soldiers and rescue workers were dispatched to the site, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Deaths also were reported in a neighboring county, Xinhua said, but no figures were available. The Lhasa airport and the Qinghai-Tibet railway which stretches from western Qinghai province to Tibet continued to operate, the agency said.
China says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although many Tibetans say their homeland was essentially independent for most of that time. On March 14, monk-led protests against Chinese rule turned violent in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, and ethnic Chinese residents were attacked.
China's State Seismological Bureau said the initial temblor was centered in Dangxiong county, which has a population of about 42,000 people, mostly herdsmen.
""I felt the building shaking a little bit and saw a bench overturn,"" said Ge San, an employee at the Baima Hotel in Dangxiong, who was sitting in a room with about five other employees.
""The shaking was not heavy. We stayed in the room and were not frightened,"" she said, adding that all the hotel's guests remained on the premises.
In Lhasa, employees at the Civil Affairs Bureau rushed out of their building when the tremors began but returned soon after, said an official who refused to give her name.
""I was in my office on the third floor,"" she said. ""The shaking lasted for about half a minute.""
Xinhua said that so far, none of the city's landmarks, such as the Potala Palace, appeared to be damaged.
One of the agency's reporters in Lhasa said shops remained open and there was no panic on the streets.
Authorities said seismologists and officials were sent to the area and were assessing the situation.
China's far west is fairly earthquake prone. On Sunday, a magnitude-5.7 earthquake shook the Xinjiang region, which borders Tibet, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which also suffered a 6.6-magnitude quake hours later. At least 60 people were killed when a village collapsed.
Tibet, a sparsely populated region, has been hit by several moderate earthquakes in recent weeks.
Last month, a magnitude 6 quake struck near its border with Nepal but there were no reports of damage or casualties.
In late August, the USGS reported that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 hit the region. Chinese state media said schools, a hydropower station and 622 homes were damaged and about 2,000 people forced to seek temporary shelter.
A 7.9 magnitude earthquake on May 12 devastated parts of Sichuan province, just east of Tibet, killing 70,000 people and leaving 5 million homeless.

"6051",20071436,"Title: Two killed in Nepal ethnic clash.rtf; Date: February 28, 2007 Wednesday 12:05 PM GMT; Text: At least two people were killed in a clash between former Maoist rebels and ethnic activists in southwestern Nepal, officials said Wednesday.
The latest deaths, which occurred Tuesday, brought to 31 the number killed in ethnic clashes since the start of the year and came as the Himalayan nation was gripped by a nationwide strike and blockade organised by ethnic groups.
Members of the People's Rights Forum, a pressure group which represents the ethnic Mahadhesis who make up around one-third of the country's population, clashed with Maoist rebels in the town of Nepalgunj.
""Two people were killed in the fighting,"" chief district officer Narendra Raj Sharma told AFP by telephone from the town.
The forum said the two were beaten to death.
""At least 14 others were injured,"" said forum official Sarbadev Ojha.
The group, whose protests to demand autonomy left 29 dead earlier this year, resumed a blockade of customs offices and the main highway leading to Kathmandu on Monday after suspending their demonstrations for nearly two weeks.
Its blockade along the southern plains, known as Nepal's bread basket, has brought border trade and transportation to a virtual halt.
A previous 20-day blockade by the Mahadhesi Janadhikar (People's Right) Forum left the capital short of fuel and other essential supplies.
Their campaign has brought pledges from Prime Minister G.P. Koirala to turn Nepal into a federal state and increase electoral seats for Mahadhesis.
But the group has said it will not sit down for talks until Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula resigns over what it calls the ""excessive behaviour"" of police in putting down earlier protests.
The campaign by the long marginalised Mahadhesis has also sparked protests by other ethnic minorities.
A one-day general strike called by another ethnic group to press for increased representation in parliament paralysed life across the country, shutting schools, markets and businesses on Wednesday.
The Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities, which represents 50 ethnic communities, says it also wants a greater political voice for all minorities.
Protests by minorities have cast a cloud over a peace deal signed late last year that ended a decade-long civil war and brought Nepal's Maoists into parliament.

 A seven-party alliance spearheading a pro-democracy campaign against the king of Nepal called for a new mass rally in the capital on Friday.
The grouping held a ""mass movement coordinating committee"" meeting Thursday evening after police shot dead three people and injured scores when tens of thousands defied a curfew on the outskirts of Kathmandu.
""We appeal to all people to participate in the massive demonstration on Ring Road on Friday at 12 noon,"" a statement said, warning that the royal government might enforce another curfew.
""Our movement is successfully moving forward despite the state's excessive use of force during demonstrations nationwide,"" it said.
A general strike which entered its 15th day on Thursday ""will continue with more intensity in the capital and across the country until further notice,"" the parties said.
The strike has crippled the country and prompted giant neighbour India to tell the king to restore democracy urgently to halt mounting civil unrest.
The royal government clamped an 18-hour curfew inside the capital's ring road on Thursday, but huge crowds turned out to challenge armed police and soldiers protecting the city centre.

Police said one AK-66 rifle, one magazine with 28 rounds, one 9mm Pistol-1, one Magazine with six rounds of ammunition and a Bayonet were recovered yesterday after the encounter with the militants. Acting on a tip-off, the Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel had been conducting a special operation in the tribal dominant hamlet. All of a sudden, a group of ATTF extremists, led by self-styled captain Nanigopal Debbarma, opened fire on the security forces which was retaliated with a counter-fire. After 20 minutes of heavy gun battle, the militants fled under cover of the dense forest. Later, police conducted a raid in the area and recovered arms and other incriminating documents from the spot, Superintendent of Police (Operation) Nepal Das said. He claimed that some of the ultras were seriously injured in the encounter and the police had launched a manhunt in the area.

"2277",20044534,"Title: Weeds by any other name can be a feast.rtf; Date: September 6, 2004, Monday, BC cycle; Text: One man's weeds are another's feast. If you're in doubt, just ask some of the nation's top chefs and organic farmers.
Chicago chef and cookbook author Rick Bayless, for example, tells about the first time he tried to buy lamb's quarters, or quelites, as the Mexicans call them - American farmers call them weeds.
Bayless had just discovered what he describes as the ""incredibly delicious"" flavor of the emerald-green quelites while visiting a street market in Toluca, Mexico. The greens were boiled, then sauteed with onion and garlic, finally dashed with red chili salsa and stuffed into a blue-corn tortilla.
When he returned to the United States, Bayless did some research on the delectable greens. ""I found them everywhere,"" he says. ""It's one of the major weeds here in the Midwest.""
When Bayless contacted a farmer about buying the greens, the farmer expressed ""total disbelief.""
""They couldn't understand why we would want the stuff - until we cooked them up and then they couldn't believe how delicious they were,"" Bayless recalls.
Today, Bayless buys up to about 50 pounds of them each week at $8 a pound for his Frontera Grill and Topolobampo restaurants in Chicago. The greens must be grown organically and must be carefully chosen, with no big stems.
""People pull out lamb's quarters from their garden and consider them a horrible infestation,"" Bayless says. ""I think they taste so wonderful, I want to bring them to my house.""
Of course, the use of the word ""weed"" here is arbitrary, with its application often depending on who's plucking the plant from the garden and maybe cooking it.
""A weed is not really a defined term,"" Peter Brave, owner and chef of Brave New Restaurant in Little Rock, says. Diners there can order the house salad, which includes a spring mix with cultivated dandelion leaves adding their slightly bitter, tangy flavor.
""I imagine that 90 percent of the people who are getting it don't even know they're eating weeds. We probably want to keep it that way,"" Brave joked.
Among the farmers selling wild greens is Henry Brockman, who runs Henry's Farm, a small family operation in Congerville, Ill. Brockman sells organically grown produce to some high-end Chicago restaurants and to consumers at the nearby Evanston Farmers' Market.
He says the people who buy his wild greens tend to be more upscale consumers. Brockman, who has lived in Israel, Japan and Nepal, incorporates his knowledge of other cultures' foods into his farming; he includes an impressive array of Asian examples among the more than 500 varieties of the 200 basic vegetables and greens he grows.
That's not to mention the wild greens - dandelions, stinging nettles, purslane, amaranth (""otherwise known as pigweed"") and lamb's quarters that sprout up each year whether he likes it or not. ""I look at them not as weeds but as food,"" he says.
Brockman had eaten amaranth, a high-protein annual with a slightly sweet flavor, in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. It's served raw in salads or cooked, and even its seeds can be used, as cereal or ground into flour, according to ""The New Food Lover's Companion,"" by Sharon Tyler Herbst.
Brockman is particularly fond of lamb's quarters, which can be eaten raw in salads when they're very small or cooked like spinach or added to soups when they're bigger. In salads, Brockman also enjoys purslane, a succulent plant with tiny yellow flowers, a light, lemony flavor and containing omega-3 fatty acids.
In her 1997 book, ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"" (Broadway Books, $40), Deborah Madison mentions weeds' nutrition - she writes that purslane and lamb's quarters are not only delicious but are endowed with antioxidant vitamins C and E, beta carotene and other protective substances.
""If you have a garden, chances are you already are growing purslane and lamb's-quarters,"" she writes. ""Instead of weeding them out, try mixing them in a salad.""
When Brockman first began bringing the wild greens to the Evanston market several years ago, he would bring only 10 or 12 bunches. ""It took a while to get people to try them,"" he recalls. ""A lot of people would say, 'Isn't this the same stuff I pull out of my garden?' The funny thing is they'd go ahead and buy it anyway.""
Now, Brockman sells 25 or 30 bunches of wild greens at $1.50 each at the weekly market. ""He pretty much sells out of the weeds,"" says his sister, Terra Brockman, who helps on the farm.
For now, Brockman has to haul his wild greens about 160 miles from his central Illinois farm to sell them in Evanston. People around Congerville won't buy ""weeds,"" he says. ""They look at me like I'm crazy.""
Terra Brockman says Henry's Farm starts the season each spring with stinging nettles, called ortiche in Italy. ""Most people will know it as a terrible weed,"" she says. ""When you brush up against them, they will actually sting like a red ant. So, you pick them with gloves"" and boil them to get rid of the sting. Only the young shoots and leaf tops are used.

"7044",20083952,"Title: Nepal votes in landmark elections.rtf; Date: April 10, 2008 Thursday 7:20 AM GMT; Text: The troubled Himalayan nation of Nepal was voting Thursday on its political future, marking the climax of a peace process with Maoist rebels and the probable end of a centuries-old Hindu monarchy.
The United Nations and election officials said the polls appeared to get off to a strong start with a high early turnout, particularly in the capital Kathmandu, and only sporadic and minor incidents of violence.
Security was tight across the country, following a string of killings and bombings, as well as reports of widespread voter intimidation in the final days of campaigning.
""Early voter turnout seems to be quite heavy,"" Kieran Dwyer, the spokesman for the United Nations Mission in Nepal, told AFP.
""We are receiving reports, not confirmed by us in all cases, of some incidents involving violence in some parts of the country, but at the same time voting appears to be going smoothly in many parts of Nepal,"" he added.
Police and election officials said voting had come to a halt in just a handful of the 21,000 polling booths set up for the polls -- an encouraging sign given that there were fears the elections would not even take place.
Polling began shortly after dawn and ends at 1700 (1115 GMT), but the results of the vote -- which will create a 601-member assembly tasked with rewriting the constitution -- will not be known for at least three weeks.
The elections are central to a 2006 peace deal between Nepal's former rebel Maoists and mainstream political parties that ended a decade of civil war and attempts by the country's unpopular King Gyanendra to assume absolute power.
The king, who assumed the throne in 2001 after much-loved former king Birendra and most of the rest of the family were massacred by a drunk and drugged crown prince, is expected to be sacked when the new Constituent Assembly is formed.
But he can still count on support from sections of the army and Hindu fundamentalists who see him as an incarnation of a Hindu god.
The vote is also seen as a major test of the resilience of the peace deal, with the Maoists still viewed with deep suspicion and accused of using bullying tactics despite their pledge to embrace multi-party democracy.
The big question, say analysts, is whether the outcome gives the Maoists -- still classed by Washington as a ""terrorist"" organisation -- enough political clout to motivate them to stay within the democratic system.
Nepal's main parties, the centrist Nepali Congress and the centre-left Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), are expected to grab most of the seats.
But Maoist leader Prachanda, who was greeted with flowers and cheering crowds when he voted, said the democratic experience was being embraced by his rebel force -- whose 20,000 fighters have been confined to UN-monitored camps.
""The dreams of thousands of our martyrs have come true,"" Prachanda told AFP after casting his vote. ""We are making new history for Nepal and it is fantastic.""
Youth activist Rajendra Mulmi said the country was simply hoping for better days ahead after a war that left at least 13,000 people dead and crippled the economy of one of the poorest places on Earth.
""People have waited a long time for development and there is no alternative to peace,"" said Mulmi, head of the Associations of Youth Organisations umbrella group.
""Whoever rules the country will have to deal with the economic agenda. We have China and India on either side which are main players in the global economy. We have to take advantage of our location.""
The polls are the most closely watched in the Himalayan country's history, and UN chief Ban Ki-moon has urged all parties to ""exercise restraint and remain calm.""
Large numbers of police have been mobilised nationwide, and even alcohol has been banned in an effort to keep the polls peaceful.
The Brussels-based International Crisis Group has, however, warned the period after the polls ""will likely be difficult and dangerous.""
""Nepal has many possible flashpoints, not least that the two armies that fought the war remain intact, politically uncompromising and combat-ready,"" the think-tank said, referring to the Maoists and the pro-royal national army.

UN experts called on Asian nations to step up their surveillance of HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, saying a lack of reliable data was compounding the difficulty in forming strategies against the disease.
Indian Parliament Speaker Manohar Joshi issued a call to MPs to team up with health workers battling AIDS, dubbing the disease ""a catastrophe in slow motion.""
""In Asia the window of opportunity for bringing the HIV/AIDS epidemic under control is narrowing rapidly. … Both India and China are experiencing serious epidemics that are affecting many millions of people,"" Joshi said at the start of the two-day, 14-nation conference.
""The warnings have also been sounded in other South Asian and Southeast Asian countries of the potential that exists for a rapid escalation of the disease if immediate measures are not taken,"" he said.
Joshi's warning came on the back of an announcement last month that 4.58 million Indians were living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 2002 -- a leap over the figure of 3.97 million the previous year.
A recent US government study estimated the number of Indians with the virus could reach 25 million by 2010 if New Delhi did not wake up.
The Indian parliament speaker said the fight against HIV/AIDS was ""no longer merely a policy issue.""
""I make a special appeal to parliamentarians who have a central role in making partnerships at national, regional and global levels for HIV-related health work in a meaningful way,"" Joshi said.
""In view of their status and the nature of their responsibilities, elected representatives are in a better position to sensitize decision-makers, planners and those responsible for implementation of the programme,"" he said.
International delegates, however, appeared cynical of the statistics given out by countries in South Asia, which represent a third of the world's work force.
""The data is scant, the data does not actually reflect what actually exists because the surveillance system is really not covering the whole population,"" said Emelia Timpo, an expert at UNAIDS, the joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS.
""But now that is an area where most South Asian countries are working on for a better grasp of the data and to be able to target intervention to their relevant populations,"" she said.
Timpo said HIV/AIDS data in Bangladesh was based on a 1993 count while Nepal was estimated to have roughly 60,000 infected people but had only 2,598 detected cases.
Suman Mehta, global HIV/AIDS coordinator of the United Nations Population Fund, warned South and Southeast Asia could follow in the footsteps of AIDS-crippled southern African nations.
""The picture has changed dramatically,"" she said, and urged parliamentarians to take time off from politics to forge strategies against the disease.
""Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Nepal and Vietnam have registered marked increases in HIV infection last year. China is on the brink of a widespread AIDS epidemic. In India the figures are also daunting,"" she said, blaming the rise on poorly funded anti-AIDS programmes.
Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, chief of India's National AIDS Control Organisation which is tasked with fighting the disease among the country's billion-plus population, said AIDS ""must become everybody's business.""
""We need parliamentarians. We need business leaders, we need faith-leaders and opinion-makers, governments, national programmes and civil societies across the border otherwise AIDS will take over the business of everybody,"" she said.

 'We urge withdrawal of the hike of prices and rates of all taxes aimed at bringing harm to the country and the people,' Prachanda, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), said in a press statement.
The rebels will launch forceful protests nationwide if the government fails to take concrete measures in that direction, the rebel leader said.
 The Maoist supremo also expressed solidarity with political parties, organizations, and members of civil society that have raised protests and taken to streets against the price hike and raise in taxes.
 Last week the government raised the price of petroleum products by 29 percent, while increasing Nepal's value-added tax rate from 10 percent to 13 percent.
 Deuba has sought to justify the hikes by saying the government needs to channel more money to the Royal Nepalese Army battling the communist insurgents.
 The hikes have met with stiff opposition from political parties, business and industrial community, and students who have launched nationwide protests.
 This past week, the Nepalese premier also said now that the rebels have refused to rejoin peace talks despite repeated calls, he would announce the date for a parliamentary election.
 In his statement Tuesday, the rebel leader also said Deuba's 'threat' to hold the election will turn out to be costly for him.
 The prime minister has abandoned the path of peaceful solution of the civil war through a dependable international mediation, Prachanda said.
 The rebels want a vote on king's powers to precede parliamentary polls.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Nepal and Australia, the musical production is touring the country with the collaborative efforts of The Style Group and Shree Mangal Dvip (SMD) Boarding School in Boudha, Kathmandu.
The musical play called ""'sPlat"" is the brainchild of Australian husband and wife duo Phil and Jodi Tweed. 'sPlat is used extensively in Australia as an educational resource aimed at school children aged between six and 12 years. It was designed to communicate the importance of good values in everyday life.
""This is my seventh trip to Nepal, and I have a very good relationship with Shree Mangal Dvip School and the children there,"" shared Jodi Tweed, Director of The Style Group, who added, ""I'm really glad to bring the musical group to perform here.""
'sPlat's story line revolves around the adventures of a platypus named Plat, an animal native to Australia. The play revolves around the journey of Plat. His journey sees him put nine important values like care, compassion, freedom and honesty into action. The songs throughout the musical capture these values and reinforce these messages.
""The children from Australia and SMD will be performing together on one stage, and this will give them the opportunity to interact and share their culture and experiences,"" she said.
She further said that music can bring out the creativity in a person and she really wanted the children at SMD to develop such creative skills. She also wanted to promote inter-cultural relationships among the children.
SMD is a school for underprivileged children from remote villages in the north of Nepal. ""The children at the school and we all are really grateful and ecstatic to collaborate with the musical group from Australia,"" shared Pema Norbu, a teacher at SMD.
The crew is made up of volunteers from Australia and Nepal. The characters of the play have been evenly distributed among the children at SMD School and the participants from Australia.
""Jodi gave us the script last year and the children have been practicing by themselves,"" Pema explained. After the Australian team arrived, they got to practice together.
Miriam Fisher, who is helping with production and promotion, shared, ""The event is also being organized to encourage diversity among people and promote tolerance of differences.""
Australian Ambassador to Nepal, Her Excellency Susan Grace, is officially launching the event at SMD School on January 14 at 6 pm.
Subsequent performances will be held at SMD School from 6 pm on January 15 and at 1 pm on January 16. Each performance will run for approximately 90 minutes. Admission is free.

Appa, who like most Sherpas uses only one name, reached the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit at 5:45 a.m. local time (0000 GMT), said Purna Bhakta Tandulkar, chief of Nepal's Mountaineering Department in Katmandu.
The seasoned climber led a team of Western mountaineers and other Sherpa guides to the peak. Asian Trekking, the company that organized the expedition, said Appa and the others had safely descended from the summit and were expected to reach base camp Monday night.
Like most Sherpas, Appa grew up in the foothills of Everest, and began carrying equipment and supplies for trekkers and mountaineers at an early age.
Appa first climbed Everest in 1989 with a New Zealand team led by experienced climber Rob Hall, one of eight mountaineers who died during a storm in 1996 when approaching the summit.
Sherpas were mostly yak herders and traders living in the Himalayas until Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for foreign mountaineers.
Meanwhile, dozens of climbers and their Sherpa guides scaled the peak over the weekend, becoming the first to reach the summit this year.
Nearly 150 climbers and their guides are on the mountain to try their luck before this year's spring climbing season ends later this month.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, more than 1,300 people have climbed the mountain's peak. About 175 climbers have died on its unpredictable slopes.

"1124",2003303,"Title: After Nepal Killings, a Tough King Gets U.S. Backing.rtf; Date: August 4, 2003 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
This fairy tale kingdom gone awry, perched among the world's most spectacular mountains, is once again seething with intrigue and rumor, caught in dramas involving its monarchy, its striving for democracy and outside powers. 
     Two years ago Nepal was shaken to its core when the royal family was all but wiped out in a murky attack that was officially attributed to Crown Prince Dipendra, who also died. Now the country is wondering whether an unsteady six-month cease-fire with Maoist guerrillas can survive during off-and-on peace negotiations. 
 There is an ever-shifting struggle here among three power centers: the Hindu monarchy, which has sustained the country for more than 200 years; the far weaker political parties, born in the 1990's after calls for more democracy; and the Maoists. 
Fearful that Nepal could descend into chaos or became a haven for terrorists, outside powers -- the United States, Britain and India -- are pouring in aid for the government. But the United States, which is providing $17 million to turn the parade-ground royal army into an anti-insurgent force, may find itself backing a tough king whose democratic credentials are in doubt. 
King Gyanendra, a wealthy businessman, took the throne after the palace killings as a constitutional monarch of limited powers. But now he has taken full control, dismissing Parliament, putting off new elections and appointing a royalist prime minister over the objections of the major political parties. 
The parties have broadly discredited themselves with corruption, ineffectiveness and revolving door governments, and they fear that the king will make a deal with the Maoists and move them even further onto the margins of power. 
""What is the king's role?"" Girija Prasad Koirala, leader of the large Nepali Congress Party, asked at a recent party gathering. ""I conclude that these are parts of the design already reached between the king and the Maoists."" 
During the cease-fire, the Maoists became very public, opening an office in the capital, holding rallies and giving speeches. Then, in mid-July, the office was closed and the Maoist leaders dropped out of sight. Later, the Maoists sent a message to government mediators demanding to deal directly with the king. 
""A strange phenomenon in a very strange country,"" a Western diplomat said. 
A Nepalese journalist, Mana Ranjan Josse, said: ""Seeing is not believing here. Everything is not what meets the eye."" 
The Maoist rebellion in the countryside has its roots in complex religious, ethnic and tribal realities, along with deep poverty -- per capita income is $220 a year and even less in remote areas -- and the concentration of the meager resources in a few hands. About 85 percent of the 24 million mostly poor people are Hindu. The top two castes, 29 percent of the population, hold most of the government jobs. 
The Shah family, which founded the Nepalese kingdom in 1768, and the Rana family, which ruled through hereditary prime ministers from 1846 to 1950 with the king as a figurehead, have so intermarried that they have formed an aristocracy that controls much of the wealth. 
""The reasons for discontent are real,"" the Western diplomat said. But he was critical of the guerrillas nonetheless. ""When the Maoists started,"" he said, ""they got a lot of sympathy from intellectuals, but it has dissipated because of their brutality."" 
More than 7,000 people have been killed since the Maoists went into the jungle in 1996, and Amnesty International and other groups have recorded charges of widespread human rights abuses on both sides. The army and security forces have killed and tortured civilians, human rights groups say, while the rebels have executed local officials and teachers, blown up government aid centers and public works projects, and financed themselves with bank robberies and extortions. 
Rebellion flared here in 1990 with the formation of the People's Movement, which demanded multiparty democracy. Demonstrations led to riots and some 300 protesters were killed. Finally, under foreign pressure, the royal family caved in. A new Constitution was written in 1990, intended to establish a symbolic monarchy somewhat along the lines of Britain, and an elected Parliament. 
But the system has been a bitter disappointment. The new king, Gyanendra, was known to have argued in family circles against the Constitution approved by his older brother, King Birendra, who was among those killed in June 2001. King Gyanendra's extensive holdings -- some of which were reported not to have paid taxes -- include tea plantations, hotels and a cigarette factory. 
Last October, the new king dismissed the government in a proclamation assailing its ""incompetence"" and appointed his own prime minister. He cited Article 127 of the Constitution, which outlines the monarch's ""power to remove difficulties."" 
But Devendra Raj Panday, a former minister who helped write the Constitution, says Article 127 does"

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 24 April
Dang [district in mid-western Nepal], 23 April: A huge demonstration of about 300,000 people with musical accompaniment and pageantry was staged in Dang on Sunday [23 April] in support of total democracy. The demonstration was organized by civic groups in Dang and about two dozen organizations. People from all five districts of Rapti zone, which is regarded as the birthplace of Nepal's Maoist insurgency, participated in the demonstration  - described as the zone's largest to date. Security personnel did not intervene in the rally. The demonstration was peaceful.
People from all five districts of Rapti zone and all Dang District village development committees converged on Ghorahi [the district headquarters] to join the demonstration after walking for three or four days. There were participants who had walked for seven days from Rukum District with roast flour in their bags and babies in their arms. The demonstrators played drums, Sahanai [a clarinet-like instrument], the flute and various percussion instruments.
Security personnel were nowhere to be seen as the massive demonstration made its way around the city chanting radical slogans. The agitators were to be seen occupying the post at Trafficchowk, which is normally occupied by security forces. The only sign of security presence was a Royal Nepalese Army armoured vehicle stationed near the statue of Late King Tribhuvan at Tribhuvan Park. 
Every household in the district headquarters was distributing drinking water to the demonstrators. Volunteers had been deployed in large numbers to manage the demonstration. Even children and the elderly from remote hills had walked all the way to Ghorahi to participation in the demonstration. It was difficult to tell where the procession began and where it ended. [Note: Nepal is divided into 14 zones and 75 districts. Each zone consists of a number of districts]

The king walked into the shrine of Living Goddess Kumari barely an hour after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who as head of state had visited the temple situated near the ancient Hanumandhoka Royal Palace at Basantapur in the center of Kathmandu, to participate in annual customary religious rituals.
Under Nepal's interim Constitution the prime minister also functions as the head of state and Koirala has been replacing the Nepalese king as the guest of honor at cultural and religious functions.
The Kumari, traditionally known as the family goddess of the kings, is believed to possess a divine power to protect the nation, which she transfers to the head of state during the annual festival.
Before, the king had not followed in the prime minister's footsteps when Koirala performed rituals at religious or cultural functions as the head of state.
There was no comment from the government on the king's quiet visit to the shrine, but the Maoist rebels were visibly upset.
"" It is surely a challenge to the government and to the seven-party alliance,"" senior Maoist leader Janardan Sharma told Kyodo News.
""The king has not reconciled with the political changes in the country. His latest move only supports our argument that monarchy should be abolished before the upcoming election,"" said Sharma, known as Prabhakar, who is the whip of the Maoist party in the interim parliament.
Nepal is planning to elect an assembly in November to rewrite its constitution and decide the fate of the monarchy as part of its peace process aimed at ending a decade of communist insurgency.
The Maoists, who are key players in the peace process, are insisting that the planned election to the constituent assembly cannot be held without first abolishing the monarchy.

Text of unattributed report entitled: ""Nepal's election commission issues code for municipal polls"", published by Nepalese state-owned newspaper Gorkhapatra on 6 December
Kathmandu, 5 December: The election commission has issued a local election code of conduct - 2062 for the purpose of the municipal polls slated to be held on 8 February 2005.
The code of conduct aims to make the election free and fair, control wasteful expenditure and unhealthy competition, keep the polls free from misuse of power and protect the rights of the common people.
The election commission has asked the government, government and semi-government employees, political parties, organizations, candidates and all the concerned people to respect the code.
According to the commission, the code of conduct was prepared after necessary consultations with the government and the political parties and by exercising the rights given by the election commission act 2047.
The code states that election campaigning cannot be carried out in such a way that undermines nationalism, national independence, national integrity and sovereignty. Similarly, the code of conduct has prohibited electoral activities that go in contravention to the parliamentary system, constitutional monarchy, multiparty democracy and independent judiciary. Election campaigning cannot be conducted in such a way that encourages hatred and enmity on the ground of religion, communities, ethnic groups, languages and regions.
The election commission has said that cloth banners cannot be displayed at public places as part of the campaigning. No banners, party flags and election symbols may be pasted and displayed in public vehicles and meeting venues.
The criticism of any political party or candidates should be limited within the parameters of their policy, programmes and public activities.

Nearly 2.3 million people in 16 districts of Orissa state, have been hit by severe floods which have submerged hundreds of villages after the Mahanadi River and its tributaries overflowed their banks following weeks of heavy monsoon rains, officials said.
Two more people died Wednesday, taking the toll in the state to 19, while the countrywide death toll from this year's monsoon deluge rose to more than 600, said Pratip Mohanty, the state's top relief official.
Rivers have broken embankments at more than 600 places and cut off roads in at least 560 places, he said.
Mohanty said relief supplies had reached all flood hit villages.
However, scores of angry people protested outside the Kendrapara district administrator's residence, claiming food and other relief supplies were yet to reach many areas.
Kendrapara, a coastal area that has been the worst hit by the flooding, is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the state capital, Bhubaneshwar.
""My children have not eaten anything for the past two days. Relief supplies from the government haven't reached. Will they provide food after our death?"" said Baidhar Behera, 45.
Behera said he has been camping with his wife and four children on a high river embankment since flood waters submerged his house Saturday. Incessant rains and cold winds over the past four days have worsened their plight, he said.
Tens of thousands of others were sheltering in the open or under tents made of plastic sheeting rigged on bamboo poles.
This year's unusually heavy monsoon rains have also battered India's neighbors.
Incessant rains, lightning and waterborne diseases caused by flood waters have killed more than 1,200 people across South Asia, including at least 236 in Pakistan, 216 in Nepal and 181 in Bangladesh.
The monsoon season, which began in June, ends in September.

 Police in riot gear patrolled most major intersections in Nepal's capital Thursday but the streets were otherwise deserted at the start of an anti-royal general strike.
Opposition parties sidelined when King Gyanendra seized power 14 months ago organised the four-day strike as part of a pro-democracy protest programme which includes a mass rally in Kathmandu on Saturday.
In an effort to thwart the protests, Nepal's government has slapped a ban on public meetings and called a night-time curfew. But activists have vowed to defy the ban.
Nepal's rebel Maoists, who have been waging a decade-long insurgency, called a ceasefire in the capital this week in an attempt to bolster the protests.
In a fresh crackdown, police arrested scores of protestors Wednesday as well as at least 44 political leaders.

""MONUC troops at 6:00 am launched an operation to dismantle the camp of the Armed Forces of the Congolese People (FAPC)"" at Mahagi, north of the main local town of Bunia, MONUC spokesman Christophe Boulierac said by telephone.
The UN peacekeeping troops, part of a force deployed across the vast country in the wake of a devastating 1998-2003 war, found the camp still occupied by several dozen militia men when they moved in ""without firing a single shot,"" Boulierac said.
Most of the members of the FAPC, one of six armed groups still active in the volatile region, managed to escape.
On Sunday, MONC forces went into another FAPC camp at Ndrele, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Mahagi, after an exchange of gunfire.
Boulierac said the Mahagi camp was located near a transit camp for militia members ready to turn in their weapons under a voluntary operation which began in September.
It was ""a hindrance for any fighter who wanted to disarm"", he added.
Of an estimated 15,000 militia fighters in the Ituri district, 880 have so far voluntarily turned in their weapons. Boulierac said the Nepalese troops on Thursday recovered 15 weapons and ""a lot of ammunition"".

Who can take part? Farmers in rural India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives. Target: to bring down emission levels at 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 18 months.
  In an attempt to combat global warming, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) have entered into an agreement to develop ""greenhouse gas (GHG) emission offset market"" in the subcontinent. ""Greenhouse gas emission offset"" refers to a range of activities that sequester, destroy or displace GHG emissions thereby promoting alternative and potentially low-cost means to reduce global carbon emission. CCX is the world's first, legally binding multi-sectoral, rules-based and integrated GHG reduction registry and trading system. Members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to reduce GHG emissions.
  By the end of Phase I (December, 2006) all Members will have reduced direct emissions 4 per cent below a baseline period of 1998-2001. Phase II (2010), will require all Members to reduce GHG emissions 6 percent below baseline. The CCX GHG emission reduction and trading program is supplemented by a growing project-based emission offsets portfolio, which includes agricultural soil sequestration, methane capture and destruction, forestry and renewable energy and energy efficiency offsets.
  In an exclusive telephonic interview from Chicago, Richard L Sandor, chairman and CEO, CCX Inc told the Hindustan Times, ""As per the agreement, TERI will facilitate the registration of 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from offset projects to the CCX trading platform in 18 months,"" he said, and added, ""The program provides the opportunity for rural poor in India to participate in a global marketplace, enhance their local environment while earning revenue through provision of environmental services which in this case is carbon."" TERI would promote incentive based projects for farmers, as it would identify the project, educating and sending them to the registry.
  Senior executives at CCX explained the process of securing points and money. For example, if a farmer practices conservation tillage practices in a parcel of land, thereby storing carbon in the soil, he is eligible to receive carbon permits, CCX carbon financial Instruments (CFI), from CCX that may be traded on the CCX electronic trading plat form. Each CFI, the trading currency in CCX, represents one hundred metric tons of carbon-di-oxide (CO2) equivalents. At current market prices, Indian offset providers will be able to earn around Rs 200 ($4.50) per metric ton of CO2. This could provide substantial incentives for rural poor.

The rebels ordered all vehicles to be kept off roads in and out of the capital, district headquarters and other towns in a bid to oust King Gyanendra, who sacked the government and seized direct control a year ago.
By lunchtime Saturday, only around 100 vehicles, had left the Kathmandu valley, home to 1.7 million people, said a police officer on condition of anonymity. Usually between 2,500 and 3,000 vehicles leave the valley daily.
In Janakpur, a town 390 kilometres (243 miles) east of Kathmandu, locals are facing shortages of fresh vegetables and milk.
""Many tea shops have already closed their shutters due to shortage of milk and the residents are facing shortage of vegetables due to the blockade,"" said Shyam Sundar, a local journalist.
In Palpa, a Maoist stronghold in west Nepal, thousands of people wanting to travel have been stranded for days.
""Many passengers are heading towards their destination by foot,"" said local journalist Madhab Aryal.
In the past, Maoist road blockades had been marked by the burning of trucks and booby traps on highways, but no blockade-related violence has been reported this time round, police said.
Political parties ousted by King Gyanendra when he sacked the government just over a year ago have urged the rebels to call off the blockade.
Last November, opposition parties entered a loose alliance with the rebels, further isolating King Gyanendra, the world's last Hindu monarch.
Since the Maoists began their ""people's war"" in 1996, some 12,500 people have been killed.

Il Foglio carried around 40 colour photos, taken from the Internet, on its front and back pages, showing the recent decapitations of the US hostages Olin Eugene Armstrong and Nicholas Berg, as well as Daniel Pearl, killed in Pakistan in January 2002 and the execution of a group of Nepalese. Some images are particularly shocking, such as the severed head of Armstrong, with open eyes, resting on his body.
The paper justified the move, saying it was ""to protest against the indifference, passivity, ignorance and submission with which the politicians and the media, above all in Italy, are facing up to the religious war and the clash of civilisations going on in the world.""
Two Islamist web sites on Thursday announced that Simona Torretta and Simona Pari had been executed by their abductors but their families hope they are still alive as there has been no pictorial proof of their deaths.
Explaining the paper's decision to publish despite the sensitive situation, its director Guiliano Ferrara declared: ""It is necessary to look reality in the face, know one's enemy and his methods.""
A former spokesman of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and an editorial writer in the weekly Panorama, which belongs to Berlusconi, Ferrara also chairs a television debate programme on the private channel La 7.
Il Foglio, which has a circulation of 4,000, is an influential newspaper in political circles, closely read in ministries, embassies and by journalists.
Rome's prefect Achille Serra expressed his anxiety over the tensions that such moves could provoke and called for ""dialogue between religions to prevent possible acts of violence against Italian Muslims.""

The assailants were hiding among demonstrators protesting the detention of Floribert Kisembo, chief of staff of the Union of Congolese Patriots, or UPC, and Rafiki Saba, the security chief of the same main Hema tribal faction, said Leocadio Salmeron, spokesman of the U.N. mission in Congo, or MONUC.
No one was injured in the incident, and U.N. troops fired in the air to disperse the crowd, Salmeron said by telephone from Bunia.
But Etienne Membe Ngona, the UPC deputy security chief, said one person was killed Tuesday and three others wounded when U.N. troops fired into the crowd.
Later Tuesday, a U.N. helicopter gunship fired on a pickup truck, wounding two of the 10 fighters who had aimed their weapons at the Mi-25 combat aircraft from the Indian air force, Salmeron said.
The unidentified fighters sped north out of town Bunia, Salmeron said, adding that the town was tense but calm.
The UPC commanders were detained Monday after U.N. troops dug up 4 AK-47 assault rifles, several rounds of ammunition, 6 anti-personnel mines and a hand grenade buried on the grounds of the home of UPC head Thomas Lubanga, Salmeron said.
Lubanga is in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) southwest of Bunia, the main town in restive Ituri province.
The arms and ammunition were discovered after the U.N. ordered armed groups in Bunia to hand in weapons, including those held by bodyguards of militia leaders.
The U.N. troops from Bangladesh, Uruguay, Pakistan, Nepal and India are pushing to secure Bunia before deploying in the rest of the province the size of Belgium. On Sept. 1, the beefed-up U.N. force replaced a French-led emergency force that largely stabilized the town after arriving in June to stem fighting between the UPC and a rival Lendu tribal faction. Some 500 people were killed in that fighting.
Supporters of UPC clashed sporadically with U.N. troops Monday following the discovery of the weapons and the subsequent detention of key UPC commanders, Salmeron said, adding that at least two civilians were wounded.
However, Ngona said one person had been killed and seven others wounded in the clashes Monday between U.N. troops and angry residents protesting the arrest of the UPC commanders.
""Reports that my fighters clashed with U.N. troops are pure lies. We have not fired a single bullet. It was never necessary to fire shots,"" Lubanga said by telephone from Kinshasa. ""People are angry over the arrest of Rafiki and Kisembo"" together with the UPC military security chief and 40 bodyguards.
The Hema and Lendu traditionally clashed over land and resources in the resource-rich Ituri.
But the clashes became more deadly in 1999, when the they were armed with modern weapons and used as proxies by the Congolese government and rebels and their foreign backers who fought in the civil war. At least 50,000 people have been killed.
The war broke out in August 1998 when Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila.

""Friday's emergency cabinet meeting took the decision to suspend the security officials,"" said home ministry official Umesh Mainali.
Mainali refused to say why the officials had been suspended, but state-run media reported the action was taken because they had used ""excessive force against pro-democracy protesters.""
King Gyanendra was forced to end 14 months of direct rule at the end of April after massive anti-royal protests around the country left at least 19 protesters dead.
King Gyanendra sacked the government in February 2005 and took direct control of the impoverished nation.
They were corrupt and had failed to tackle a bloody decade-long Maoist revolt that has left at least 12,500 dead, he said.
Parliament, dissolved in 2002, has been reactivated and a new multi-party government has been formed.
The new interim government has set up a five-member commission to look into rights and power abuses during the period of royal rule.
The commission recommended that the heads of the police, the armed police and the national investigation department be suspended as well as the head of the army.
The army chief, Pyar Jung Thapa, has so far escaped suspension.
The other six officials suspended were high-ranking people in the armed police force and the police, said the Kathmandu Post, an English language daily.
Four royally-appointed former ministers were rounded up Friday and handed 90-day detention orders.
Official announcements about the arrests and suspensions were expected to be made in a parliament sitting Saturday afternoon.

"1440",20043265,"Title: Journalists protest in Nepal against police brutality.rtf; Date: April 24, 2004 Saturday; Text: About 300 journalists and human rights activists demonstrated in the Nepalese capital Saturday, demanding that the government apologize for the detention and alleged beating of journalists covering pro-democracy rallies.
More than 300 journalists were detained while covering the recent political demonstrations in Katmandu, and the Federation of Nepalese Journalists has alleged that police beat some of them with batons.
All have been released, but the federation, an umbrella body of media rights groups, on Saturday demanded that the prime minister publicly apologize and that the home minister resign over the alleged mistreatment of journalists.
""Our protest is against the abuses by the government and suppression against the media,"" said Taranath Dahal, president of the federation.
The protesters wore black bands around their arms during the rally and chanted anti-government slogans. Police did not intervene in the demonstration, which was peaceful.
For the past few weeks the country's five largest political parties have been sponsored protests in Katmandu against King Gyanendra, calling for restoration of democracy in this Himalayan kingdom.
The king dissolved Parliament in October 2002 and fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control a Maoist insurgency. The king then assumed executive powers and replaced the government with pro-monarchy politicians.
Thousands of people have turned out for frequent rallies across the country since then, and police have detained hundreds of protesters. Most were released after questioning, but a handful are still in custody.
The government recently announced a ban on the protests, and threatened to arrest those who defy it.
The king announced last month that fresh elections would take place by April 2005. But the parties called the king's timetable for elections unrealistic. They want the king to immediately replace the current government with one that includes representatives from all five parties.

Text of report by Dilli Acharya headlined ""Nepal Terai groups announce decisive movement"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 20 January
Kathmandu, 19 January: On the first anniversary of the starting of the movement in the Terai [southern plains], two Terai-based groups have announced separate but what they call decisive movements. 
Madhesi People's Rights Forum headed by Upendra Yadav and the dissident faction of Nepal Sadbhavana Party led by Rajendra Mahato have announced protest programmes from 23 January to 4 February. A rebellion was launched last year in the central and eastern Terai under the leadership of the forum. 
The Madhesh Terai Democratic Party led by Mahanta Thakur also announced on Saturday (19 January) its protest movement starting on 13 February. The two groups have arranged their protest programmes in such a way that they do not coincide. 
The joint front of the Madheshi (Terai) people announced the movement at a mass held at Lahan of Siraha district. The front has forwarded a set of 19 demands. According to the movement schedule, there will be strike in all the educational institutions all over the Terai on 23 January followed by protest meetings in Bara and Kapilvastu districts the next day. On 25 January, there will be transport strike in the headquarters of all the Terai districts. On 26 January, protest meetings will be held in Morang and Bardiya districts. From 30 January to 3 February, protest demonstrations will be held in different districts and the district police offices will be locked out. On 4 and 5 February, a general strike will be called all over the Terai. 
The front has said that it is the second phase of its movement. The movement last year has been regarded as the first phase. The Sadbhavana Party and the forum have warned of third phase movement starting on 5 February if the demands are not met by the government. 
At the mass meeting held at Lahan, front chief Yadav and Mahato of Sadbhavana Party vowed to continue the movement until the demand of an autonomous Terai province with the rights of self-determination are met. 
During the movement of the forum in January last year, the group had burnt the interim constitution, saying that it had failed to honour the aspirations of the people of the Terai. The government had arrested Terai leaders, including Yadav, which sparked protest demonstrations at Lahan of Siraha district. The movement picked further momentum after student Ramesh Kumar Mahato was killed during the Lahan demonstrations in encounter with the Maoists. A total of 42 persons have died in the movement. Since then, three village development committee secretaries have been killed in the Terai. The forum has accused that the government has failed to implement the agreement reached with it. 
Meanwhile, Rajendra Mahato, who resigned as a minister, has formed a separate Sadbhavana Party headed by him. This group has made a considerable presence in the Terai scene. The forum and the Sadbhavana Party had forged an alliance for the decisive movement in the Terai plains. 
Only some time back, five members of parliament from the Terai plains belonging to different parties including minister Mahanta Thakur resigned from their parliamentary posts and started the Terai-Madhesh Democratic Party on 24 December 2007. Amresh Narayan Jhap of the party said that the next movement of the Terai would be decisive. Formation of the new party was needed because the government failed to take steps to address the problems of the Terai. Jha said that his party would make public the programmes of protest movement to start on 13 February. 
During the Lahan mass meeting, Mahato of the Sadbhavana Party announced his resignation as MP. He urged all Terai MPs to quit their parliamentary posts and join the movement. 
""I have resigned for the independence of Madhesh because the attitude of the seven parties towards the Terai is wrong,"" said Mahato. 
He demanded 50 per cent representation of the Terai region in all the sectors of the state and adoption of the fully proportional electoral system. The movement will go on until these demands are met, he said. 
Forum president Upendra Yadav said that the people of the Terai had been deceived throughout last year. He made an appeal to all the armed groups of the Terai to lay down arms and join the peaceful movement.

 Biratnagar, 3 April: Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa today warned that if the agitation spiralled out of hand, the government would not hesitate to crack down on the protesters. Thapa had arrived here to inaugurate the Hridyendra Children Garden.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Apr 04
While issuing his warning, he also appealed to the five agitating parties to conduct the agitation in a dignified manner. Stating that staging rallies was a fundamental right of the parties, Thapa lashed out at them for choking the streets of the capital in the name of exercising their democratic rights.
 Asked if the government had tried to take the present agitation in its own control, Thapa said it was not so. The PM added that patience was the need of the hour if the present political crisis was to be solved. Emotional outbursts would never provide the way out of the impasse in the country. Thapa also called for consensus among the parties.
 Thapa said everything about the date of polls was clear from the king's recent address in Pokhara in which he called for conditions to be created to make it possible to hold an election within the next 12 months .
 ""Didn't you hear the king's address in Pokhara? Everything is clear,"" the PM said.

"6199",2007911,"Title: Harkat hand seen in UP blasts.rtf; Date: May 23, 2007 Wednesday 1:06 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, May 23 -- The serial blasts in Gorakhpur once again proved that Uttar Pradesh continues to figure on the radar of terrorist groups. The pattern of the blasts, according to sleuths, points to a high-profile group, probably the Harkat-ul-Jehadul Islami (HuJI), with a vast network across the state through various low-key offshoots.
  ""There are similarities between the Varanasi and Gorakhpur blasts at first sight and the pattern comes close to the modus operandi of HuJI,"" said a senior intelligence officer on condition of anonymity. And, he added, the blasts are yet another indication that terrorists are back in the state.
  Uttar Pradesh, in fact, has a history of being a breeding ground for terrorists for various reasons. Proximity to New Delhi is one; it helps terrorists get away faster. Second, some sections in parts of western and eastern UP with borders close to Nepal subscribe to and reciprocate the terrorists' brand of ideology.
  Back in 1996, the state was rocked by its first terror attack: bombs went off in a state transport bus in Modinagar, killing 10 people. The Harkat-ul-Ansar's UP commander Faizul Waheed claimed responsibility.
  Six years down the line, Kanpur was shaken by twin blasts in Arya Nagar on the eve of Independence Day. And barely three hours later, RDX tore through the Sabarmati Express in Roshanmau Railway station of Faizabad, killing nine passengers.
  The very next morning, remote-controlled bombs exploded in the Vidhan Sabha canteen. Students' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) activists were arrested from all over the state in connection with these explosions. In 2005, there was an explosion on another train - the Sharamjeevi Express - near Jaunpur. And again, SIMI activist Babu Bhai - who trained at HuJI camp in Bangladesh - was arrested.
  According to recent intelligence inputs Kairana, Saharanpur, Meerut, Aligarh, Siddharth Nagar, Chandauli and Ambedkar Nagar are being exploited to the fullest and maximum recoveries of explosive have been reported from these cities. ""Terror groups have for long been trying to create communal flare-ups akin to 1992 to get recruits. The attacks in Ayodhya and Varanasi were part of this unholy stratagem,"" said an official. The Gorakhpur blasts are just a continuation.

Ten soldiers and 16 rebels were killed in the fighting, army officers at the site and at army headquarters in Katmandu, the national capital, said on the customary condition of anonymity.
The clash took place in the mountainous Pandol area in Kailali district, 600 kilometers (480 miles) west of Katmandu, the officers said. Bodies of 16 rebels were recovered and there were believed to be more militant casualties, they said.
Six security personnel were killed at the same place last week.
The rebels have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Fighting between the rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and government forces has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last year.

Items on display at the museum will include valuable artifacts accumulated by the Shah dynasty in its 239-year rule of the Himalayan nation, according to Home Secretary Umesh Mainali. Officials hope the museum will be finished in six weeks, although an opening date has not been set.
The palace in Katmandu was formally renamed the Narayanhiti Palace Museum at a government ceremony Sunday, days after deposed King Gyanendra moved out.
Nepal outlawed the monarchy and declared itself a republic last month after elections in which former communist rebels won the most seats in a special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution.
Police and soldiers escorted Gyanendra and his wife, Komal, from the palace last week. The couple moved to Nagarjung, a summer retreat on top of a forested hill just west of Katmandu.
The Narayanhiti palace had been Gyanendra's home since 2001 when he took over the throne following the assassination of his brother, King Birendra.
A 1939 Mercedes Benz given by the German Nazi leader Hitler to King Tribhuvan, Gyanendra's grandfather, will be restored and displayed at the museum, Mainali said.
""Other items of interest would be the throne (and) the weapons and uniforms used by Gyanendra's ancestors,"" Mainali said.
But the main attraction will likely be the king's extravagant crown, studded with precious stones including diamonds, emeralds and rubies and made for King Mahendra, Gyanendra's father, half a century ago. The crown also decorated with peacock feathers and yak hair was last worn in public by Gyanendra on June 4, 2001 when he ascended the throne.
Gyanendra became unpopular after he seized absolute power in 2005. He was forced to give up his authoritarian rule a year later following weeks of pro-democracy protests.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala hoisted the red-and-blue national flag at the museum on Sunday during a function attended by a small crowd of people and politicians, many of them setting their feet on the palace grounds for the first time.
Among them were the former communist rebels, formally known as Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), who waged an armed insurgency for 10 years before joining a peace process and emerging as the largest political party in April elections.

The government has formally made this call through cabinet decision by endorsing the recommendations made by the high-level peace committee.

 If talks are unanimously desired, now everyone needs to be focused on creating appropriate environment for the same. The Maoists need to respond positively to the formal call for negotiations. The government, for its part, should withdraw the terrorist label and the Red Corner notice, paving the way for a cease-fire. It matters little whether the talks are open or secret, if they turn out to be decisive, result-oriented and sincere.

The one-time rebels, known as the Maoists, say they have no plans to renew their armed revolt.
They were planning a mass gathering in central Katmandu later Tuesday where they were expected to detail their plans for protests against the government, which they say has been too slow to declare Nepal a republic and meet their other demands.
The withdrawal from the government was confirmed by senior minister Ram Chandra Poudel, who is a member of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the administration.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bharatmohan Adhikari tabled the bills for ratification at the parliament meeting and the House subsequently endorsed them by a majority.
The government was given the Friday deadline to endorse the conventions by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global body overseeing anti-money laundering. Had the parliament failed to ratify the conventions by Friday, the global body could have blacklisted the country. In such a situation, international community would have stopped carrying out financial transactions with Nepal.
The former rebel party UCPN (Maoist) was planning to register its reservations on the Article 2 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism-1999. Maoists demanded that the convention be ratified only after clarifying the wordings 'organized crime' mentioned in the convention. Though Maoist Lawmaker Ekraj Bhandari earlier in the afternoon registered his reservations in writing at the parliament secretariat, which he later withdrew.
""I agreed not to take my reservations against certain words in the convention any further as the Finance Minister, while addressing the House, clarified that the convention wouldn't be invoked with regard to any political activities,"" Bhandari told Republica.
Similarly, Usha Kala Rai of the ruling CPN-UML registered her reservations against the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999. ""Nepal hereby declares that it doesn't consider itself bound by the provision of paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism.""
The paragraph 1 of the Article 24 reads, ""Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation of application of this convention which cannot be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If within six months from the date of the request for arbitration, the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice, by application, in conformity with the Statute of the Court.""
Going by the commitment expressed in the international forum, Nepal was required to ratify three UN conventions and four Acts related to anti-money laundering (AML) and controlling of terrorism financing by 2010. Amid political transition, Nepal repeatedly missed the deadlines.
Given the gravity of the situation, Finance Minister Adhikari on Thursday had to personally write to the plenum of FATF currently being held in Mexico, apprising it about Nepal's latest endeavors to get the required conventions and Act endorsed by the parliament.

"5449",20061232,"Title: Keeping the Faith, losing our Religion.rtf; Date: July 1, 2006 Saturday 1:56 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, July 1 -- When I first read about the ""outrage"" of Sabarimala, my initial reaction was one of astonishment. As far as I could tell, what had happened was this: it was alleged that 18 years ago, a woman had breached the temple's security and got within touching distance of the idol of Lord Ayappa and might have (shock! horror! gasp!) placed her feminine fingers on the deity.
  The woman had confessed to the deed (or not; the story changes from day to day) and accused one of the priests of assisting her in committing this mortal sin. Aforementioned pujari had hotly denied this terrible allegation but the temple authorities believed that he was bluffing because (and I swear I am not making this up) an astrologer had discovered that the poor, dear deity was disturbed and this could only be because a naughty girl had touched him. The temple authorities were now drawing up an action plan to purify the site so that no traces of the accursed female presence of nearly two decades ago remained.
  Whew! Now, I'm not the sort of man who gets too self-righteous about the perceived lack of logic of all religious belief or the kind of guy who regards the traditions surrounding places of worship as necessarily irrational or idiotic. I've been known to wear a Ganesh locket; I turn vegetarian on Tuesdays; am happy to queue up outside Bombay's Siddhi Vinayak temple; have made the trek to Tirupati twice; and feel guilty if I pass through Fatehpur Sikri or Ajmer without paying my respects at the dargahs of Salim Chisti and Moinuddin. In fact, my mother even claims that I was conceived in response to a mannat at the Fatehpur Sikri dargah.
  So, I quite readily accept that faith cannot be judged on the basis of rationality and science. But something about the Sabarimala story strikes me as deeply offensive. Part of it is the credulousness of the media. Nearly all newspapers (and I do not exclude the HT) have been eager and willing to buy into the temple's line that the mere suggestion of a female presence in the sanctum sanctorum constitutes a terrible outrage. And part of it is my anger at what I have always seen as the regressive streak in all religions, including Hinduism. We can kid ourselves into believing that the furore is about Ayappa's bachelor status (so fragile, apparently, that it was threatened when a woman touched his idol). But the truth is that it is about the primitive notion that the bodily functions of women are unclean.
  The injunction against women extends to those between the ages of ten and fifty. In real terms this means: women who menstruate. Children are okay. Menopausal ladies are fine. But any woman whose ovaries are in working order and whose womb is still in operational condition is to be regarded as dirty. It is an injunction that we come up against in many of the world's great religions though, of course, it is usually expressed more subtly. Why is it that a menstruating woman is not supposed to enter a Hindu temple? Why can she not take part in a puja, even within the sanctity of her own home if she has her period? Why does the ability to give birth demote a woman's moral credentials?
  Why do we worship the Kumari in Hinduism? Why is it so important that the most important female character in the New Testament should be portrayed as a virgin? (In contrast, the sexually active Mary Magdalene is written off as a whore.) You need only to observe the bizarre ritual of the living goddess in Nepal to understand how twisted Hinduism's take on a woman's reproductive powers can be. Each year, a pre-pubescent girl is selected as a living goddess and venerated till she reaches puberty. Once she is menstrual, she is cast aside and condemned to live a sad, neglected life. Some former living goddesses end up begging. Some sell their bodies.
  I cannot believe that any intelligent, educated man (let alone woman) can respect this notion that menstruation - and the reproductive ability it symbolises - is unclean and accept that the mere touch of a menstruating woman can desecrate a holy shine. So why does nobody tell the Sabarimala trustees where to get off? Why do we so faithfully reproduce their regressive, primitive nonsense about restoring the sanctity of the temple? Why don't we go in there and drag them, kicking and chanting, into the 21st century?
  I think you know the answer as well as I do. In today's India, we have come to confuse secularism with a respect for the most regressive traits in every religion. Each time there is a conflict between what we see as religious tolerance and some basic liberal value - free speech, gender equality or anything else - we choose 'religious tolerance'. In the beginning, this secular suspension of liberalism extended only to minorities and especially to the Muslims. Whenever there was an issue that involved, say, gender rights, we ignored all our traditional values and plumbed unhesitatingly for what we saw as the Muslim position.

"16",20032235,"Title: Atop the world, but not lonely ; Climbers rush to Everest for a lofty anniversary(2).rtf; Date: The International Herald Tribune; Text: May 28, 2003 Wednesday
It's getting a little crowded at the top.
In the past week, climbers rushing to scale Mount Everest before Thursday, the 50th anniversary of the first successful summit ascent, have set a rash of records, including oldest (70), youngest (15), fastest (12 hours, 45 minutes), again the fastest (10 hours, 56 minutes) and the most frequent (13 times).
Three people stood on the peak Monday, including Sibusiso Vilane, a climber born in Swaziland who became the first black person to accomplish the feat. It was the third attempt by Vilane, 32, in recent weeks.
The New York Times
As many as 500 climbers are jostling to reach the summit by Thursday, largely using the southeast ridge that took Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the top on May 29, 1953.
Today on the ridge, climbers have the advantage of about 60 aluminum ladders over a treacherous ice fall and thousands of meters of fixed ropes.
Climbers are also laying trophies at the feet of Hillary, the 83-year-old New Zealander who is in Katmandu this week for what may be his last visit to his beloved Nepal. Norgay, a Sherpa, died in 1986.
The records for the most and the fastest ascents fell Monday to two Nepalese Sherpas. Climbing through the night, Appa, 43, reached the summit early Monday, his 13th ascent since 1990. He was part of a nine-member expedition that was there primarily to pick up decades-old trash left by other climbers.
Perhaps most impressive, Lhakpa Gela, 36, cut almost two hours off an Everest speed-climbing record that was set just days earlier, reaching the summit from the base camp in 10 hours, 56 minutes and 46 seconds. Normally, climbers take about a week to get from base camp at 5,350 meters (17,550 feet) to the summit.
The climb Monday was so unexpected that The Himalayan Times, a daily newspaper, carried a front-page photograph of another climber, Pembe Dorjie, wrapped in victory garlands and grinning happily under the headline: ""Fastest climber says he can do it faster."" Dorjie had climbed the mountain Friday in just under 13 hours, a record that lasted only the weekend.
On Thursday, Ming Kipa, a fresh-faced 15-year-old girl, became the youngest person to reach the summit at 8,850 meters. Eluding Nepal's ban on children under 16 attempting Everest, she climbed with her older brother and sister from the northern, Tibetan side.
The Sherpa ascents, displaying enormous stamina, were a salute to Hillary, who turned down an invitation to celebrate in London with the queen of England to be with friends in Nepal.
Over the last half-century, Hillary has devoted much of his time and energy to raising money for schools and clinics for Sherpas, a mountaineering people who are the backbone of any high-altitude expedition in the Himalayas. On Tuesday, he is to be the centerpiece of a festive parade that will wind through the streets of this city, the capital of a country that is often described as the top of the world.
While the festivities take place, often grim tests of endurance take place on the beautiful if dangerous mountain that straddles the border of Nepal and Tibet. As a reminder of the potential dangers, a newspaper Monday carried a photograph of Sherpas dragging a sled with the corpse of Kami, a Sherpa who died in a fall.
Other articles Monday related how a British military expedition had abandoned its climb to rescue a British climber with a broken leg, and how three injured French climbers had been evacuated by a Royal Nepal Army helicopter.
A record of 65 expeditions are expected at Mount Everest this season. Since the 1953 ascent, more than 1,200 people from 63 countries have reached the summit. At the end of the season last year, the largest number of climbers, 258, came from Nepal, followed by 160 from the United States. About 175 climbers have died trying, with as many as 120 bodies interred on the mountain.
Hillary has argued in interviews here that Nepal should ""give the mountain a rest,"" limiting climbs to four or five expeditions a year.
With the Outdoor Life Network, a U.S. cable channel, planning to broadcast live from the summit Thursday, many climbers say the commercialism, crowds and litter are spoiling the Himalayan high-country experience.
""When I heard there were 760 people and 900 tents on the south side of Everest, I just felt lucky that I climbed Everest when I did,"" said Veikka Gustafsson, a 35-year-old Finn. Gustafsson made four attempts on Everest, reaching the summit twice, once in 1993 and again in 1997.
Celebrating over dinner his group's ascent of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain at 8,650 meters, he said, ""At our base camp, there were nine tents.""
But across the dinner table, Premnuru, the expedition's 43-year-old cook, offered a different view, saying, ""More expeditions means more jobs for Sherpas, for Nepalis.""
To climb Everest, a visitor can pay as much as $65,000. In a two-month climbing season, a skilled Sherpa can earn $2,000, about eight"

"5885",20071971,"Title: Police fan out across violence-hit south Nepal district.rtf; Date: September 17, 2007 Monday 6:53 AM GMT; Text: Hundreds of police fanned out across a southern Nepal district Monday to impose a curfew after weekend violence killed at least three people and wounded several others, officials said.
The indefinite curfew applied to much of Kapilbastu district and police officers have been sent there from neighboring areas and the capital, Katmandu, said Meghnath Upadhaya, a government official in the area.
Several ethnic groups in southern Nepal have been organizing strikes, transportation shutdowns and demonstrations to demand greater rights. They include a handful of small armed groups, who sometimes fight among themselves as they compete for residents' support. Related violence has killed at least 70 people this year.
Many southerners say their region has been sidelined in favor of the more populated, mountainous north. They are demanding greater autonomy, more seats in the national legislature and a guaranteed number of representatives in the administration.
Upadhaya said that three people were known to have been killed in the latest violence Sunday, and that the toll could rise when reports come in from more remote rural areas.
The weekend clashes erupted between rival groups after attackers shot dead a politician Sunday in Chandrauta village, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Katmandu on Sunday. Two others, including a policeman, were killed.
Several houses and cars were torched, prompting authorities to impose the curfew.
Police said they were trying to find out which groups were involved.

The World Bank has provided a grant of 127m US dollars (approximately 8.89bn rupees) to help the government of Nepal consolidate the peace process and to scale up the delivery of basic services to under-served rural populations.
Three agreements were signed in Kathmandu on Tuesday [26 August] by Finance Secretary Rameshwore Khanal and Susan Goldmark, World Bank country director for Nepal, in presence of Finance Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai and Isabel Guerrero, World Bank vice-president for South Asia.
The 50m-dollar grant for the Emergency Peace Support Project intends to help Nepal fulfil commitments made under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the subsequent 23 Point Agreement.
""All three projects are anchored in the Nepali agenda - peace needs development and development needs peace,"" said Goldmark adding, ""as Nepal continues to make progress on the crucial path of peace-building and development, Nepal can be assured of continued World Bank assistance.""
The 50m-dollar grant for the Nepal Health Sector Programme is designed to expand access to and the use of essential health care services, especially by underserved populations.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 2 April
[by Surendra Kafle]
Nepalgunj [headquarters of Banke District, western Nepal] 2 April [Wednesday]: Representative of the United Nations Mission in Nepal [UNMIN] Ian Martin has said that the ongoing violence in the run-up to the election is not acceptable to the international community. Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday, he said ""the CA [Constituent Assembly] polls should be violence-free"".
Denouncing the Maoists' violent activities against the other parties, he said: ""I cannot understand what motivated them to act this way, but one thing is sure that these activities are not acceptable to us."" He also made it clear that the international community will turn away from the parties which disrupt the election for fear of losing in it.
When asked about the weapons with UNMIN seal found in Rolpa with the Maoists, he said: ""The weapons were meant for the security of Maoist deputy commander Pasang. To have found such weapons outside is violation of the peace agreement."" He also said that Maoist chairman Prachanda has assured that such incidents will not be repeated.
He said that the Maoist PLA [People's Liberation Army] should be in the cantonments not only during the election but thereafter as well. Nepal Army and Maoist PLA should abide by the comprehensive peace agreement and they should not do anything that will influence the election, he said.
He said that he has taken cautiously the chief election officer's suggestion to the UNMIN to watch the incidences of violation of poll code. He advocated that all should join hands to hold election in free and fair manner. He said: ""There are people who wish that the peace process be derailed. Caution should be taken in this regard."" He also cautioned that complications might develop even after election, and added that international community is watching with curiosity.
He said that the UNMIN was involved in poll observation throughout the clock. When asked about the remarks of the leaders that army might be mobilized for the election, he replied that the issue was not related to the UNMIN.

 Kathmandu, 2 July: Maoist Chairman Prachanda said despite his party's repeated calls for UN mediation for peace talks, the government has not done anything substantial. In this way, the government is pushing the country towards more bloodshed, he added.
Spacetime, Kathmandu, in Nepali 2 Jul 04
In a news communique released on Thursday 1 July , Prachanda said: ""In such a situation, our party and the Nepalese people have no option but to respond to an avalanche of bricks with rocks. It is clear that the old regime will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences."" Generation of sensational publicity that will only drag the country into a massive bloodbath has become a defining characteristic of the government, he added.
 Referring to the decision made by the CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) to join the Deuba government, Prachanda said that ""the party is being a supporter of regression and conspiracy and that it has betrayed the democratic wishes of the nation and people."" Prachanda made the accusation that ""the party has reduced itself to the status of a tainted sycophant.""
 The Maoist chairman reiterated the conditions of all-party conference, interim government and formation of a constituent assembly to resolve the conflict peacefully.
 Prachanda added, ""No government, which has come up under different names of the old regime to continue bourgeois conspiracies, can afford or has the intention of giving a progressive and peaceful outlet for pressing national problems.

Kalam, the architect of India's ballistic missile programme, and Charles met for about 40 minutes for talks officials described as ""cordial and constructive.""
Charles and Diana stayed in the palace during their six-day trip to India in February 1992 but there was talk of their marriage being on the rocks when sources reported the couple preferred separate bedrooms.
The couple divorced in December the same year.
Charles later Wedenesday addressed Indian scholars who have studied in Britain, saying the two countries shared a long history.
India was a colony of the British empire until its independence in 1947.
""This extraordinary bond has deep historic roots but is acutely modern in many of its manifestations and that modern relationship is driven by a healthy and shared perception that both countries have a lot to gain by building it further,"" he said.
""India and the United Kingdom are trading with each other and investing with each other as never before and I am told that bilateral trade grew by an astonishing 16 percent in the first six months of this year.
Charles flew in Tuesday on a nine-day trip to India that will include a tour of the desert cities of Jodhpur and Jaipur, where Diana deflected a kiss from Charles after a game of polo in 1992.
The previous trip ended disastrously when Charles left India for Nepal and Diana flew to the Indian city of Calcutta to meet Mother Teresa and then returned home alone.
His latest visit comes just after the release of the tell-all book, ""A Royal Duty"" by Diana's former butler Paul Burrell, which reveals details of her lovers' claims she thought somebody was plotting to kill her.
Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.

  Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) director general Major General Mohd Jahangir Alam Chowdhury even denied having received any such proposal.
  But home ministry sources here said India had made the offer twice in the last few months. Chowdhury is currently in New Delhi along with the BDR top brass for a biannual conference with BSF officials.
  Sources said India had first expressed its willingness to conduct a joint offensive when BSF DG Ajai Raj Sharma last met the BDR chief.
  The offer was reiterated during the recent home secretary-level talks.
  Sources said New Delhi's proposal came in wake of allegations that some outfits operating from India were trying to ""destabilise"" Bangladesh. India has already given a list and evidence of 195 terrorist camps operating from Bangladesh.
  Sources said the issue would again figure during the four-day conference of BSF-BDR officials. Home ministry sources said India was keen on a joint operation now as intelligence inputs suggest that the ISI was shifting terrorist bases from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to Bangladesh. There are also reports of the ISI moving operations from Nepal to Bangladesh.
  These fresh inputs will be handed over to the BDR officials. ""The increased focus of the ISI on Bangladesh is a dangerous trend, which is why we are keen on a joint operation,"" a senior BSF official said.
  Sources said the increased presence of the ISI in Bangladesh had led to a sharp rise in smuggling of fake currency and narcotics along the border.
  Chowdhury denied the presence of militant camps in Bangladesh and claimed that almost all the places India mentioned in its list had been searched.
  The BSF will also emphasise the need for joint patrolling along the border, which the BDR has been opposing so far. Trans-border crimes like kidnapping, illegal migration, trafficking of women and cattle smuggling will also figure in the talks.

A coalition of Nepal's seven main political parties had planned to hold the mass rally in the capital of Katmandu on Friday to demand the king restore democracy.
But the government announced a curfew would be imposed between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday in Katmandu and the nearby suburb of Lalitpur.
Nighttime curfews have already been imposed in the past three days. Government workers were asked to report for duty before the start of Friday's curfew.
Security forces earlier detained 78 senior politicians, student leaders and rights activists in raids overnight and in the early morning in a crackdown to head off the rally, the National Human Rights Commission said in a statement.
The government said the arrests were a protective move to prevent communist rebels from infiltrating the protest and inciting violence. The guerrillas have been fighting to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a socialist government.
""We were compelled to take some preventive measures because we have information that the Maoists are planning to create confusion and trigger violence during the rally,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa said. ""We have to protect the people and maintain peace and tranquility.""
Thapa said several people have been temporarily detained but refused to provide further details.
Earlier, a top government official said they had orders to arrest 200 people and that 22 security teams had been mobilized. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide information to the media.
The king took direct control of the government in February 2005, saying previous administrations had failed to curb a growing communist insurgency and clean up corruption.
Madhav Nepal, general-secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal, said soldiers raided his house at 4 a.m., searching for activists, and that dozens of plainclothes police were stationed outside his house. He was not placed under arrest.
Prominent human rights activist Krishna Pahadi was taken by police from his home in Katmandu, said the Peace Nepal Society, another rights group.
""We will not be threatened by the government actions. The arrests and restrictions will not stop our rally; instead it has added fuel to our movement to restore democracy,"" Madhav Nepal said.
Authorities also severed Internet services and both land line and mobile telephone services early Thursday, but later restored land lines and Internet communications.
The government last cut off communications in February 2005 when it sought to stifle dissent after Gyanendra dismissed an interim administration and formed a new one under his chairmanship.
This week, the royalist government also banned demonstrations. Organizers had said they would defy the ban and press ahead with their rally.

 Text of report by Tilak P. Pokharel, Nepalese Kantipuronline.com website on 17 September
 United Nations, 17 September: Minister for Foreign Affairs Ramesh Nath Pandey defended the ""Nepal model"" of democracy in front of the world leaders attending the 60th Anniversary Summit of the United Nations here on Friday [16 September ] by citing that models of democracy may vary according to each country's backgrounds. Addressing the High Level Plenary Meeting of the UN General Assembly that kicked off in New York on Wednesday, Minister Pandey - who represented King Gyanendra - said Nepal cherishes universal values and ideals of democracy. ""However, the 'one-size-fits-all' model doesn't apply for peoples with different historical, socio-cultural and economic backgrounds,"" he told the international community. He added that ""all sovereign and independent countries and peoples are free to choose the form of governance that suits their conditions and requirements"". The summit concluded on Friday.
Kantipuronline.com website, Kathmandu, in English 17 Sep 05
Pandey's remarks have appeared in defence of King Gyanendra justifying the ""self-styled"" Nepal model of democracy post 1 February in the international forums in Jakarta, Boao and Doha a few months ago. However, Pandey asserted that terrorism is the same all over the world. Equating the 6 June Maoist attack on a passenger bus in Madi, Chitwan (that killed almost 40 civilians) with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, Madrid, Bali, Beslan, London and Cairo, Pandey said it operates without borders… [ellipsis as published] knows no logic, no language or religion, no country, and no person. ""There could be no selective standards in fights against terror as there can be no good or bad terrorism,"" he said, adding that terrorism anywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity and ""it must be fought comprehensively, collectively and resolutely"".
 Stressing that the government was committed to resolving the problems confronting Nepal with ""patriotism being in the point of convergence"", he laid a road map to peace: inclusive process to make democracy meaningful and to ensure good governance to the people. In his nine-minute address to the General Assembly, he claimed that the government was open to all sincere efforts for peace and stability and said that it was possible only when ""terrorism was rejected totally as a means of furthering political objectives"".
 Though other world leaders, during their address, hailed the establishment of the Human Rights Council, Peacebuilding Commission and Democracy Fund - which have been endorsed by the Assembly while passing the Outcome Document (the UN's policy document for the year), Pandey didn't say anything about these initiatives. However, he said the government was committed to ""protection and promotion"" of human rights, Maoist atrocities have seriously undermined the human rights situation in Nepal.
 On Friday, Minister Pandey, on behalf of Nepal, also signed a document, acceding to the Kyoto Protocal on climate change, which legally binds those signing it to reduce the emissions of certain greenhouse gases responsible for global warming by 2012. He also participated in an international committee of 16 countries, formed to preserve Lumbini - the birthplace of Lord Buddha.
 When Pandey was delivering his speech inside the UN headquarters, there were over 200 Nepalis from Nepal and all across the United States of America, demonstrating against Nepal's regime in front of the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, just a stone's-throw away from the assembly hall. Addressing the rally, which was co-organized by Nepal's former Permanent Representative to the UN, Murari Raj Sharma said the king says one thing and does just the opposite.
 ""He preaches democracy, but practises dictatorship. He has promised peace but has given more violence,"" he said, adding that the monarch has made Nepal a police state at home and a pariah state abroad. Various personalities who addressed the rally - Sharma, former National Human Rights Commission member Sushil Pyakurel, human rights defender Dr Gopal Shiwakoti, activists Anand Bista and Sanjay Parajuli - urged the world leaders to boycott the king's regime and to put pressure on the king to restore democratic rights and civil liberties, among others.
 In the rally, which was co-organized by US-based organizations - Nepalese Democratic Youth Council and Alliance for Democracy and Human Rights in Nepal, local literateurs also recited pro-democracy poems and played songs. Later, the group demonstrated in front of the Nepal's mission to the UN, until the police asked them to leave.

One person was killed and 15 others were injured, four critically.
According to MTPD statistics, 12 motorcycles and two four-wheelers had hit road dividers. All the accidents occurred between 6:00 pm to 6:00 am.
Twenty-five year old Ritesh Pokharel, who was critically injured after his motorcycle (Ba 46 Pa 8350) collided with a road divider at Gaushala, breathed his last while undergoing treatment at Bir Hospital on June 18.
""Sheer negligence on the part of drivers is to blame for 99 per cent of accidents involving road dividers in the capital,"" said SP Jagat Man Shrestha, spokesperson, MTPD, rejecting allegations that road dividers are the major cause behind accidents.
""Road accidents caused by collision with dividers can be reduced only if drivers become more cautious. Road dividers are meant for safety,"" he said.
Shrestha informed that almost all drivers who hit road dividers were either drinking and driving or overspeeding.
""MTPD has not been able to apply retro-reflective paint on the road dividers to make them visible from a distance due to shortage of fund,"" Shrestha conceded, adding that MTPD was planning to come up with new initiatives in this regard.
According to MTPD, there are 2,607 concrete travel lane dividers in the Kathmandu Valley and they have been set up at Gongabu, Kupandole, New Baneshwor, Gaushala, Chabahil, Tripureshwor, Putalisadak, Maharajgunj, Jamal, Singha Durbar, Ratopul, Old Baneshwor and Thapathali, among others.

""The department will immediately start action against all the firms under to Foreign Exchange (Regularisation) Act at first,"" he said, adding that other acts including Revenue Leakages (Investigation and Control) Act might be attracted later, if they are found guilty in revenue leakages too.
The department has come to the conclusion that it should take action against eight firms since they have misappropriated Indian Currency through 599 fake customs declaration forms, he added.
The department has forwarded the customs declaration forms to the Department of Custom and it had on September 16 tallied all forms and found them all fake. The Department of Revenue Investigation has suspected some Rs 1 billion IC misappropriation from the fake customs declaration forms, he informed.
However, the department is yet not clear regarding the action against banks involved in the case, according to the department.
An investigation team that was deployed by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) on Wednesday has sought justifications from six commercial banks and they are yet to submit them clarification, the department source said, adding the department will decide the type of action after it gets clarifications.
Nepal Rastra Bank team is expected to finalise investigation process by Tuesday, according to the bank source. Banks will face action under the Foreign Exchange Act, if they have proved to be approving foreign currency exchange without filling foreign currency exchange form, the central bank said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Revenue Investigation is planning to send a team for a detailed investigation into the issue. The department will carry out the investigation in other parts of the country including Biratnagar, Butwal, Bhairahawa and other districts bordering to India besides Birgunj, Shrestha added.
Some of the businessmen have been misusing the banks to draw IC fuelling the capital flight apart from informal business channels. They have been using the banks in the bordering districts as it will be easier for them to draw IC and pay to traders which has been not only hurting the government coffer but also widening the gas between formal and informal channels.

 Kathmandu, 28 July: Gastroenteritis, which has been spreading across Nepal for the past three months, has claimed the lives of more than 300 people. However, the disease is yet to be brought under control in several areas that are most affected.
 Epidemiology And Infectious Disease Control Department has however, put the death toll at 184. Despite gastroenteritis affecting 35 districts, the department says only 29 districts have been affected by the disease.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 29 Jul 04
""Because the information channels through which the department receives information are slow, the number of death appears less,"" a department source said.
 There are also accusations that the department has implemented measures without consulting experts despite the rapid spread of gastroenteritis. ""The department has focused more on the information campaign rather than controlling the spread of the disease,"" one expert said. The disease has affected the western region the most. Cases of gastroenteritis have also surfaces in flood-affected district since Sunday 25 July .
 Meanwhile, Health Minister Ashok Rai on Wednesday telephoned the head of the Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Control Department, Dr Mahendra Bista, and instructed him to dispatch medical teams to Kalikot district immediately, a Health Ministry source said. The minister also asked for regular briefing on the situation in that district.
 According to the department, a total of 14,871 people have been affected by gastroenteritis since the disease first surfaced three months ago. ""Our statistics show that of those affected by the disease, 184 people have died,"" Dr Bista told Kantipur.
 The department has also claimed that it has buffer stocks of medicine in all five development regions to control the outbreak of gastroenteritis. But sources said medicines have not reached the affected area as required. Dr Bista admitted there were difficulties in the mid-western region.
 The department has also claimed that rapid response teams were currently working in areas where the spread of the disease is still out of control. It is thought that the spread of the disease will be brought under control by mid-August. The disease has mostly affected children under the age of 10 and people over 40 years old.
 According to the statistics of the Department, 25 people have died in four village development committees in Baitadi district far west Nepal and nearly 400 people are affected by the disease. The disease has been brought under control in only two village development committees so far.

 The Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Control Department says the disease will diminish once the cooler season starts. The main reason for the spread of the disease is said to be contaminated water and lack of proper hygiene.

"7032",20082959,"Title: Nepal 's 'god-king' wakes up to life as commoner.rtf; Date: June 12, 2008 Thursday 1:59 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's former king Gyanendra on Thursday began life as a commoner after leaving his sprawling palace home and army of servants for the last time.
He will have to adjust to living in a former hunting lodge on the outskirts of the capital, after leaving the Narayanhiti palace in the back of a black Mercedes with his wife late Wednesday.
Several hundred people gathered to watch the king's departure from the massive complex in the heart of Kathmandu, with most cheering the end of the monarchy, while a handful of royalists wept. 
In his first comments since his 240-year-old dynasty was formally abolished late last month by a Maoist-dominated assembly, the ex-monarch said he respected the decision to turn Nepal into a republic.
""I have assisted in and respected the verdict of the people,"" he said in a short address in a hall decorated with stuffed tigers and rhino heads, adding that he ""will not leave this country"" and go into exile.
Narayan Wagle, the editor of the Kantipur Nepali language daily, who watched the address said it was a ""graceful"" end to the world's last Hindu monarchy.
""He has exited gracefully and peacefully and his message focused on garnering sympathy from Nepali people in the future,"" said Wagle.
During the address, Gyanendra hit back at charges he was behind the palace massacre that vaulted him to the throne in 2001.
He became king when his nephew Dipendra, the then crown prince, killed most of his family, including the king and queen, in a drink and drug-fuelled rage after being prevented from marrying the woman he loved.
He then apparently shot himself and was briefly declared king while brain dead before Gyanendra became monarch.
""My family and I have been continuously defamed with ill intentions which was saddening and still is. The accusations targeted against us were inhuman,"" he said.
Many in the country believed he plotted the palace killings, even though an official probe cleared him.
The former king was laying down a challenge for the government to reinvestigate the palace massacre, Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of Nepal weekly news magazine, told AFP.
""The way he expressed his opinions and presented the facts it is a challenge to the government to prove him wrong,"" Ghimire said.
The decision to abolish Nepal's monarchy was taken by a constitutional assembly formed as part of a peace deal between former Maoist rebels and mainstream parties who joined forces when Gyanendra tried to assume dictatorial powers.
He ended his period of authoritarian rule in April 2006 after massive protests organised by the parties and the Maoists.
The end of his reign and departure from the palace is the culmination of a peace deal signed in late 2006 between the groups, which ended the bloody insurgency that had killed at least 13,000 people.

According to Tiwari's widow Babita and Om Prabesh Patel, a member of the Bishwo Hindu Yuba Sangh, former chief district officer (CDO) of Parsa and currently Joint Secretary at the Land Reform Ministry, Nagendra Jha, invited them to his house Tuesday morning and paid them Rs 800,000, asking them to say publicly that they don't know who masterminded Tiwari's killing.
Tiwari, chairman of Bishwo Hindu Yuba Sangh, was shot dead a year ago, and Jha was CDO of Parsa at the time.
Babita said that Jha repeatedly phoned them and persuaded them to come to Kathmandu after Parsa district police office submitted an investigation report to the Office of the District Public Prosecutor implicating Sah as the mastermind in Tiwari's killing.
""After repeated urgings by Jha, we came to Kathmandu Monday evening,"" said Patel, who has accompanied Babita to the capital. ""We went to Jha's house at Baneshwor, where he gave us a sum of Rs 800,000,"" he said.
According to Patel, Jha also asked them to meet Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai Tuesday afternoon and tell gathered journalists that they had no idea about Minister Sah's involvement in Tiwari's murder.
Asked why they readily accepted the money offered by Jha, Patel said, ""We couldn't decline the money at that moment because we were already afraid of the possible consequences if we declined the offer.""
Though they left Jha's residence with the money, they declined to meet Prime Minister Bhattrai Tuesday evening as arranged by Jha. ""We didn't go to see the prime minister,"" Patel said.
Instead, Patel, Babita and her brother-in-law Paryag Tiwari consulted human rights activists and lawyers and with their help organised a press conference this afternoon at Yalamaya Kendra, Lalitpur to inform about the blood money.
At the press conference, Babita calimed that Jha had given his word to find her a job, educate her children and fulfill all her demands if they refrained from blaming Minister Sah in connection with the murder.
Related news: Case dropped against Minister Sah
""I don't want money; I just want the culprit to be booked and punished,"" Babita said, adding, ""If the former CDO wanted to help me, why was he silent till today""? She also said that Parsa SP Ramesh Kharel was an honest officer who investiged the case and tried to bring the guilty to book.
SP Kharel started investigating the year-old murder case immediately after he was transferred to Parsa a few months ago. Police recently arrested Aman Kushwaha, who admitted that he was paid Rs.200,000 to ride a bike that the hitman would pillion-ride. He also disclosed that Minister Sah's personal secretary, Siyaram Kushwaha, was the pillion rider who pulled the trigger on Tiwari.
Aman also told police that the murder plan was finalized under the direction and in the presence of Sah.
Jha has, however, claimed that he never gave any money to Tiwari family members as claimed by them. ""It is true that they came to my home Tuesday morning. I offered tea but I haven't given them money. Their allegations are baseless."" Asked why he met the Tiwari family at such a sensitive time, Jha said, ""They repeatedly asked me to help them and so I met Tiwari's relatives.""
Jha has a controversial record himself. A top government official said that only recently the Ministry of Home Affairs had transferred Jha to the Ministry of Land Reform following his ""controversial activities"" in his capacity as CDO.
Tiwari family members are now preparing to lodge a complaint at the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) against Joint Secretary Jha, accusing him of bribing them. ""We are preparing to file complaint against Jha at the anti-graft body as we found his activities unlawful. We will also hand over the Rs 800,000 to the CIAA Thursday,"" Patel told Republica.
Lawyers and human right activists have demanded an immediate probe into the incident.
""What is the source of the Rs 800,000,"" Advocate Tikaram Bhattarai questioned, ""The source of that money must be probed as this is a very serious matter."" He further demanded that Prime Minister Bhattarai also be brought under investigations over this affair. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

""There will be no attacks from our side but our troops will be on high alert,"" Information Minister Mohammed Mohsin said after a Cabinet meeting.
Last week, the rebels announced they would suspend all offensive operations from Oct. 20 to Oct. 28 for the Dasain festival.
Mohsin said the government was hopeful that the temporary truce would extend longer and the rebels would agree to join negotiations on ending the 8 1/2 years of conflict.
The two-week festival is the biggest in Nepal and is celebrated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The festival started last week but the main festivities begin Wednesday.
Schools and government offices are closed during the holiday and most people visit their village homes to see their families. However, the insurgency has forced many people to avoid such travel.
The government has repeatedly offered peace talks to the guerrillas, saying the nation deserves an end to the conflict which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Fighting between the rebels and government soldiers has escalated since August 2003, when the insurgents withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire.
The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and want to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state.

Political conditions are totally different in India and Nepal, where the former Maoist rebels look likely to become the largest party in the government following April 10 national elections, said Sriramulu Srinivas, a senior leader of the Indian guerrillas.
""We will never follow the example of Maoists in Nepal and fight elections,"" Srinivas told reporters Wednesday outside a court in southern India where he was on trial for his role in the assassination of a former state government minister.
""We believe in capturing power through armed struggle,"" said Srinivas, who is a member of the rebels' Central Committee.
The rebels, who call themselves the Communist Party of India (Maoist), say they are inspired by the late Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They have been fighting in several Indian states for decades, demanding land and jobs for agricultural laborers and the poor.
The violence has killed about 2,000 people, including police, militants and civilians.
Nepal's Maoists gave up a 10-year insurgency in 2006 and joined mainstream politics the following year. More than 13,000 people died in the fighting and the United States still considers the Maoists a terrorist organization.
Even with only partial election results released it seemed clear the Maoists would form the backbone of Nepal's new Constituent Assembly, which will rewrite the constitution, govern and decide the country's political future.

The two sides announced a 22-point code of conduct for the peace process on March 13 in order to create a lasting peace in the country, in which both sides agreed to refrain from using arms and violence, calling strikes and initiating other activities that may derail the peace process.

 Text of report by Nepalese Kantipuronline.com web site on 3 August
 Kathmandu, 3 August: The use of vigilante groups to protect villages from Maoist attacks has further escalated violence in Nepal, Amnesty International said on Wednesday [3 August].
 AI has shown grave concerns over the ""Village Defence Forces"" which, it accuses, is backed by the government.
Kantipuronline.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 3 Aug 05The London-based watchdog said that the emergence of such armed civilians group in many districts is intensifying the terror and violence experienced by the civilian population.
 ""The creation of these 'Village Defence Forces' blurs the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, resulting in an increased number of civilian casualties,"" said Purna Sen, AI's Asia-Pacific programme director, in a statement today.
 Amnesty in its new report also said that human rights abuses by both the security forces and the Maoists continue.
 ""Torture by the military is both systematic and routine,"" said Sen. ""Military officials who operate in an environment of complete impunity admitted to using ill-treatment to extract confessions.""
 AI said it is concerned about the ""continued culture of denial and impunity"" within Nepal's security forces.
 On Tuesday, the Royal Nepal Army had billed Amnesty International's report that said children suspected of Maoist affiliation were being detained and tortured for long periods in army barracks, as unfounded and malicious.
 The RNA said that AI's accusations were ""very generic and not based on facts"".
 RNA in the statement also said that its soldiers were not involved in providing support to vigilante groups fighting the Maoist atrocities in villages.
 ""While such statements from RNA headquarters are welcome, they directly contradict the reality in the districts, where we found strong evidence of security forces support for vigilante groups,"" Sen said today.

""We have reached an eight-point understanding to get the country out of the current crisis,"" Krishna Prasad Sipaula said.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala met the elusive Maoist rebel leader Prachanda Friday for a first round of direct talks to try to end the insurgency that has crippled the Himalayan nation.
""A democratic republic is our minimum demand and we will go to the Nepali people with this demand during the constituent assembly elections,"" Prachanda said following the meeting.
The new government has agreed to hold elections for a body to redraft Nepal's constitution, a key demand of the Maoists who also want to scrap the monarchy.
The Maoists and a seven-party political alliance now running the country entered a loose alliance last year.
Once foes, the two groups organized mass protests that forced King Gyanendra to end his direct control.

"4373",20061283,"Title: Code Red_ Naxals, the biggest threat.rtf; Date: March 25, 2006 Saturday 10:31 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, March 25 -- PM Manmohan Singh on November 4, 2004 asserted that Left-wing extremism (LWE) constituted ""an even greater threat to India than militancy in Jammu & Kashmir and the Northeast."" What makes it so?
  If we assume a high intensity militancy erupting in J&K, Punjab and all the states of Northeast simultaneously, the total area affected would be 11.09 per cent of the country's geographical area and 4.51 per cent of its population. Life in the rest of the country would largely remain normal. In contrast, the LWE today already affects nearly 40 per cent of the country's geographical area and 35 per cent of its population. This is nearly four times the combined area of J&K, the Northeast and Punjab, and eight times the population. Unless some master strategic response is formulated and executed, the nation may find most of its rural hinterland overrun by an avalanche.
  Strategy of encirclement
  The Maoists strategise that having entrenched themselves in the rural India they would be able to choke the urban islands through encirclement. Graduating from strategic defence and strategic equilibrium they hope to reach the stage of strategic offence within the next six to seven years. The conflict scenario of Indian Security Forces overstretching themselves to cover India's vast rural hinterland and fighting their own people with little public support would negate much of what free India stands for - its constitution, democracy, rule of law included. Too far fetched? That is how it appeared in Nepal a decade back.
  Today the writ of the regime there stops with the setting of the sun except in Kathmandu, a few urban centres and the cantonments. Nearer home, the idea of Compact Revolutionary Zone within India's hinterland, which in early 1990s appeared to be a pipe dream, is a near reality. This is what makes the threat more serious than that of J&K or the Northeast.
  Even at their peak the Kashmiri terrorists, Northeast insurgents or Sikh militants were not able to mobilise the masses; they at best were able to stun them into silence. Contrast that with the Jehanabad raid on November 13, 2005, in which about 1,000 armed Naxalites rescued 340 prisoners and kept the town under siege for several hours. And it is not an isolated incident confined to one area or a state. On Friday, 500 armed Naxals laid siege to the Orissa town of R. Udaygiri for three hours; last Monday, Naxals hijacked a train in Jharkhand.
  The uniformity of pattern in different states is not coincidence but part of a strategic design. They do not need so many people for physical action but they need to train them for eventual strategic offence when the Indian Security Forces would be pitted not against the terrorists but the masses. Their holding jan adalats, almost every third day (115 in 2004) with advance publicity in which punishments including ""death sentence"" are pronounced and executed in public further reinforce the trend.
  Politicians, their allies
  Only the political parties have an antidote to outdo the Left extremists in this game by accessing the people, providing them leadership in fighting injustice, real or imaginary, though democratically acceptable means. Unfortunately, the divisive politics of the country are more a cause than the cure of the problem. Further, quite often political parties arrive at secret understandings with the extremists for electoral gains.
  While strategic threats posed by the LWE to Indian polity, Constitution, economic interests, etc. are important, the concerns at security level are immediate and pressing. In the last four years there has been an accretion of over 40 per cent in its cadre strength from estimated 5,000 in 2001 to over 7,500 in 2005. In the last year alone over 1,000 new cadres joined the Naxalite movement.
  Imparting new and advanced skills to its cadres in terms of handling of weapons, fabrication of improvised explosive devices, field tactics, communications, collection of intelligence etc. have been receiving special emphasis using the services of ex-servicemen and police personnel. There are unconfirmed reports of their having received training assistance from LTTE, particularly in respect of fabrication of IEDS. While in 2001, 48 training camps were being run by them, the number increased to over 78 in 2005, depicting an increase of over 55 per cent.
  Similarly, improved communications have worked as a major force multiplier. As part of their structural re-organisation, the earlier loosely constituted armed groups and dalams with a nebulous command and control system are being substituted by forming companies, platoons and sections on military pattern. The People's Liberation Guerrilla Army, the armed wing of the CPI (Mao) is being structured on the model of People's Guerrilla Army (PGA) of the PWG. Their acquisition of new weapons with qualitative up-gradation is cause for concern. Till 2001, more than 60 per cent of their weapons were countr"

Donald Camp, U.S. deputy assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, said the United States was deeply concerned that Nepal's government still has no elected officials at any level.
""We would like to take this opportunity to encourage the king and the political party leaders to restore Nepal's democratic institutions and develop a unified strategy for resolving the political crisis and (communist) insurgency,"" Camp said.
Thousands of people have demonstrated in Katmandu and elsewhere nearly every day since a campaign to restore democracy was stepped up last month.
Some of the rallies, organized by Nepal's five largest political parties, have turned violent and scores of people have been injured. Thousands have been detained.
Camp is in Nepal to take part in a two-day international donor's meeting in Katmandu.
He said he met King Gyanendra on Wednesday and other political leaders on Thursday and asked them to narrow their differences and work together to settle the country's communist insurgency.
Nepal's political crisis began in October 2002 when King Gyanendra fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, accusing him of incompetence and failing to end the insurgency. The king then dissolved Parliament, assumed executive powers and appointed a new pro-monarchy government.
The opposition parties are demanding formation of a new government that includes members of all five parties.
The United States has been the government's biggest supporter in its campaign against the rebels, who are fighting to replace the monarchy with a communist state and say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
""Preservation of Nepal's system of constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy is the key to defeating the Maoist challenge,"" Camp said.
The rebels have criticized the United States for giving Nepal millions of dollars in military and development aid.
Fighting has escalated since the rebels pulled out of a cease-fire in August. More than 8,500 people have been killed since the insurgency began in 1996.

"7415",20118672,"Title: Danish pop band marks 20 years of fame in Asia.rtf; Date: April 26, 2011 Tuesday 05:46 AM GMT; Text: The Danish pop band Michael Learns To Rock has sold more than 10 million albums, performed in packed stadiums and spawned a string of soaring ballads that echo every night through countless karaoke bars.
But the trio's success belies a curious facet of its career: Two decades after releasing its debut CD, Michael Learns To Rock remains unknown in the United States and much of Europe but retains a legion of fans far away in Asia.
""When we started out by playing small gigs in small towns in Denmark, we had big dreams about world fame and fortune, but we feel privileged enough now to be embraced in Asia,"" drummer Kare Wanscher said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur this week during a three-concert Malaysian tour.
Michael Learns To Rock initially comprised a quartet of two high school friends and their acquaintances who grew up loving pop music. They came up with their band's name on a whim, inspired by Michael Jackson and 1980s groups such as Johnny Hates Jazz and Frankie Goes To Hollywood.
The young men enjoyed a promising beginning by winning a 1988 talent competition in Denmark and writing English-language songs that secured them a recording contract in the United States.
Despite recording their eponymous first album in Los Angeles and embarking on a promotional push in New York in 1991, the CD flopped in America. Their lead single, ""The Actor,"" received airplay in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, but the foundation for their future was paved by an Asian record executive who made it a No. 1 smash in Indonesia.
Other Asian nations such as Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines soon succumbed to the band's charms, which blend the easy-listening wistfulness of Barry Manilow with the infectious melodies of ABBA.
""The honest feelings in our songs fit the Asian way,"" said songwriter Jascha Richter, whose warm vocals have surely formed the soundtrack for numerous real-life teenage romances. ""When we come to this region, we see a tradition for singing along to love songs that match our approach.""
Some critics call Michael Learns To Rock's music mawkish. One of its biggest hits, ""25 Minutes,"" tells of a man who searches for a lover with whom he broke up, only to find her standing in a wedding gown in front of a church. She tearfully informs him that he's 25 minutes too late.
But their radio-friendly earnestness turned the three men into Denmark's biggest pop export, handing them respectable CD sales from Taiwan to Thailand and making them the headliners for a star-studded 1997 Hong Kong concert that marked the former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
Another 1997 show in Hanoi nearly sparked a stampede when thousands of Vietnamese fans who were tricked into buying fake tickets hurled bricks through windows to enter the hall. Riot police escorted the band to safety.
These days, the band has a relaxed routine of making an album every few years and touring regularly, with recent stops in China and India. It plans to issue its eighth album this summer and still wants to perform in Bangladesh and Nepal.
Now in their 40s, with children they take on tour, the men say their youthful ambitions for wider fame have vanished.
""We're busy and happy. We won't try to spend a year in America to crack its market,"" said guitarist Mikkel Lentz.

Peace negotiations between the insurgents and the government have slowed, and rebel negotiators are still discussing whether the truce will be extended indefinitely, spokesman Dinanath Sharma said.
The rebels and the government declared a cease-fire in April after weeks of pro-democracy protests forced King Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule and appoint veteran politician Girija Prasad Koirala as prime minister.
The rebels, who had been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and replace it with a communist state, had backed the protests. The conflict killed 13,000 people and devastated the Himalayan region's tourism-based economy.
The rebels and Koirala's government have held at least three rounds of peace talks since the cease-fire but the two sides have made little recent progress.
There has been little progress in drafting an interim constitution, and the rebels have yet to join the interim government.
Further differences surfaced Monday when rebel leader Prachanda wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan protesting a government request for U.N. assistance in the peace process.
Prachanda said terms of a possible peace deal discussed in the letter appeared to unfairly favor the government.
A high-level U.N. delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nepal on Wednesday to review the negotiations.

 Kathmandu, 7 August: The Maoists informed the government today that they would propose the date and venue for the third round of talks within two days. They also made it clear that they would not stick to technical issues about the army's movement but would enter directly into the proposed political agenda.

 Tuladhar immediately conveyed Dr. Bhattarai's message to the government.
 According to a source close to the Maoists, the rebels are going to propose a venue outside the Kathmandu Valley. However, Tuladhar said the government wants the venue to be within the valley.
 He also said that he drew Dr Bhattarai's attention to the repeated violations of the code of conduct by the Maoists in recent days, especially the planned attacks on security personnel.
 Dr. Bhattarai is reported to have said that there were some breaches of the code of conducts from both sides. ""But it was an accident where the vehicle of the security forces was caught in an ambush planted by the Maoist side for self defence,"" Dr Bhattarai is reported to have said.
 Minister Kamal Thapa also informed today that he has complained about the violations of code of conduct to the Maoist leader K.B. Mahara during his telephonic talks Wednesday.
 Four security personnel, including a civilian driver, were killed Tuesday when the vehicle in which the security personnel were travelling hit a land mine laid on the road by Maoists in Panchthar.
 Reports from Panchthar said that Maoist rebels have warned the government forces not to patrol beyond the five-kilometre boundary from the barrack. Mausam, the district secretary of the Maoist outfit, told The Kathmandu Post over telephone that the security vehicle was ambushed for ""violating the agreement of limiting the army's movement within five kilometres from their barracks.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 21 May
[by Krishna Regmi]
Kathmandu, 20 May: A colluded involvement of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) staff in human trafficking has been exposed. This was revealed recently after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) warned NAC to stop bringing Nepalis without visa.
The UAE has warned it will blacklist NAC if it does not stop dumping passengers without visa at Dubai airport. If blacklisted, the national flag carrier will be barred from flying to Dubai, a lucrative destination where it flies thrice weekly.
The warning came from Dubai Immigration Department to NAC through its station manager at Dubai. The warning says the UAE will be compelled to take action as repeated complaints have been ignored by the NAC management.
According to our source, UAE has also warned that the state-owned airlines will have to pay 550 dirham (over 10,000 rupees) [approx 150 US dollars] per passenger as penalty if it brings in such passengers, next time.
The corporation's own regulations prohibit carrying passengers without visa in flights to countries where Nepalis are not entitled to get on-arrival visa.
""It is happening with the nexus between immigration officials, police, manpower agencies and NAC officials,"" said a source at NAC.
According to a highly-placed source at NAC, who requested anonymity, the latest case happened on the last week of April, which stretched till the first week of May.
On 23 April, NAC carried 22 passengers who had no visa and return tickets to Dubai. When the NAC plane returned to Dubai on its subsequent flight on 1 May, they were greeted by the same 22 people, stranded at the airport.
""The UAE immigration ordered us to take back those passengers,"" said the source.
By then, the stranded Nepalis were once flown to Iraq by human traffickers from Dubai, but brought back and dumped at the same place, the source told the Post quoting one of the victims.
However, the plane could not fly back the next day as scheduled because of technical glitches.
The glitch remained until 6 May. The 22 Nepalis remained at the airport terminal. The corporation took other passengers to the hotel outside the airport. ""NAC provided meals to them,"" said the source.
But when the plane was ready to take off, the languishing passengers were nowhere to be seen .
""We do not know for sure what happened to them. But they might have been taken to Iraq again by chartered flight, and hopefully they succeeded in entering the violence-ridden country.""
Though such human trafficking is impossible without the involvement of immigration officers, P.N. Sharma, chief of Immigration Office at TIA [Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu] expressed his innocence. ""I do not believe that passengers without visas have reached Dubai. But, in case they have, we will take action against responsible officials. We have records of who issues departure permission to whom,"" said Sharma.
On its part, NAC has also advocated not guilty. B.P. Basyal, marketing director of NAC, said: ""The UAE visa comes in a separate paper, so it is quite difficult for us to distinguish the original from the fake."" However, the 22 people stranded at Dubai were all without visas, not even fake ones.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 31 January
Pokhara [town in western Nepal], 30 January: Leaders of the citizens movement have claimed that the terai [southern plains of Nepal] is burning because of the erosion of public trust in the leaders of the eight political parties. Their argument is that this situation has arisen because none of the parties has claimed as its own the interim constitution that all eight political parties had endorsed.
Addressing a citizens' gathering organised in Pokhara by the Human Rights and Peace Society Kaski [district in western Nepal], citizens' movement leader Krishna Pahadi said it would be most harmful if the leaders of the eight parties gave themselves over to criticizing that interim constitution.
""Those who framed the interim constitution do not own up the constitution and instead engage in politics over it"", Pahadi said adding, ""The leaders of the eight political parties should not have objected to the interim constitution which was brought in for only a short period of time. It was by taking advantage of this that those opposed to the constituent assembly have come out against the interim constitution"".
He claimed that pro-royal elements started to hatch conspiracies as action was not taken immediately after the 19-day popular movement against King Gyanendra, who led the autocratic regime. ""King Gyanendra should have been sent to jail for crimes against human rights, and it will be unfortunate if action is not taken against the king even now"", Pahadi opined.
He claimed that pro-palace elements infiltrated the movement launched by the people, as action was not taken against the suppressors immediately after the end of the popular movement. ""The state made a mistake in giving them an opportunity to organize instead of taking action against them"", he said.
Claiming that the restructuring of the state wold be impossible as long as the monarchy remains, human rights worker Pahadi said, ""The seven parties should now give up their fondness for the king, and if the country continues to have a king there will never be stability.""
Alleging that violence has flared in the terai because of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandidevi), Pahadi warned that if the unity among the eight parties is dismantled, the mandate of the popular movement would also end.
Pahadi also claimed that tensions in the terai increased because the transitional period has become prolonged. He alleged that the transitional period had become prolonged because of the love of office on the part of the political parties.
Criticizing Maoist activities, Pahadi said it is objectionable for the Maoists to raise donations from the people after they started taking from the government the revenues raised through taxes paid by the people.

"4977",20065337,"Title: Nepal 's king breaks silence amid crisis, calling for dialogue with opposition.rtf; Date: April 14, 2006 Friday 11:49 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra broke his silence Friday after more than a week of pro-democracy protests in which four people have died, calling for dialogue with the country's main political parties.
The political parties, however, rejected the king's plea and vowed instead to continue with protests that have filled the streets for the past eight days to demand Gyanendra's ouster 14 months after he seized control of the government.
Representatives of the alliance of the seven major political parties were meeting in Katmandu on Friday to decide their next move to pressure the king to restore democracy.
""The king has failed to address the protests and the movement for democracy. He is only using the offer for dialogue to try prolong his rule,"" said Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress party, the largest party in Nepal.
""We will intensify the protests until we get rid of the autocratic monarchy,"" Sitaula said.
Amrit Bohara, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal, said that, ""People are pouring to the streets against his rule and he does not seem to care.""
In a message for Nepal's new year, Gyanendra called for ""the active participation of all political parties committed to peace and democracy,"" and he again said the country should hold a general election, although he did not specify a date.
The king's call for elections is in line with a roadmap back to democracy he announced shortly after seizing power in February 2005. It has been roundly rejected by his opponents, who demand that a special assembly be convened to rewrite the constitution and limit his role.
""He has not moved an inch"" from the road map, said Minendra Risal of Nepali Congress Democratic party.
The speech was broadcast just after midnight Friday, and most people heard it only later in the morning.
Hours later the political parties were meeting to decide how they are going intensify the protests.
""We are deciding on how to step up our protests including strictly enforcing the general strike imposed since last week,"" Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress said.
Government officials said they were prepared to deal with the threats by the political parties.
""We will react as we have to,"" Information Minister Shrish Sumshere said about opposition plans to extend the strike.
There were more cars on the roads in the capital Katmandu and the main cities in Nepal compared to previous days, but the highways were deserted on Friday, the ninth day of the general strike.
""There was not much the king offered to his opponents. The stubbornness is not going to be good for the country which is already deep in crisis,"" businessman Nirmal Shrestha said. ""He should have offered to talk with the parties and the rebels without setting any conditions.""
A few smaller rallies were reported in Katmandu and other parts of the country but no major protests took place mainly because Friday is a new year holiday. Most Nepalese spend the day with their family and visit temples.
However, about 1,000 demonstrated in the resort town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu. The protest was peaceful and police did not intervene.
During the previous eight days, thousands of activists joined rallies in Katmandu and elsewhere demanding a restoration of democracy, some of them chanting ""Hang King Gyanendra!""
Many demonstrations have deteriorated into bloody clashes between stone-throwing protesters and security forces, who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, in some cases, live ammunition.
Nepal's opposition along with a well-armed communist insurgency argue that any elections held under Gyanendra's rule would be neither free nor fair.
In the speech, Gyanendra did not mention the opposition protests, or the insurgency, which has left nearly 13,000 people dead in the past decade.
In response to the king's speech, Maoist rebel leader Prachanda said the king ""has shown the height of insensitiveness toward the problems faced by the country and the people.""
""It has made it clear there is no other alternative than to establish a republic by sweeping away the monarchy,"" he said. ""It also shows that the desire of the people for a people's democracy and peace can be achieved by pushing the present movement that followed the understanding between the seven political parties and the Maoists.""
Gyanendra said in February 2005 that he took control of the country to stamp out political corruption and end the communist insurgency. Many of Nepal's 27 million people at first welcomed the move. But the insurgency has since intensified and the economy has worsened, fueling broad discontent.
Nepal's seven main political parties launched the latest wave of protests and a general strike on April 6 to demand that the king restore full democracy.
The royal government responded harshly. Four people have been killed by security forces firing at the protesters and hundreds have been injured. The U.N. has condemned Nepalese security for excessive use of f"

    Crop substitution programs, carried out mainly in Asia and  Latin America to replace drug plantation, particularly opium  poppies and coca leaves, ""have not been very effective,"" said  Hamid Ghodse, president of the International Narcotics Control  Board (INCB) in the annual report.
    The principles of alternative development should be rethought  and ""be applied in socially marginalized urban environments as  well as in the remote rural areas,"" he said.
    The program has neglected cannabis growers, for whom no policy  was in place, he added.
    Cannabis is the main illegal drug in Africa, abused by more  than 34 million people. It is also popular elsewhere, with about  30 million people in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein,  Norway and Switzerland using it during the past year.
    Most countries applying alternative development policies have  seen a drop in growth of illicit crops, according to the report.
    Worldwide opium poppy production excluding Afghanistan in 2004  was 32 percent of the total for 1994, and Thailand has seen a 98  percent decrease in poppy production in the past 40 years.
    Almost all the heroin in Europe comes from Afghanistan, which  also accounted for 87 percent of the global production of opium  poppies in 2005, said the report.
    The country is also seeing an increase in drug abuse, not only  of opiates but also of prescription drugs.
    The INCB also reported other developments in drug trafficking  and use in Africa, where there was a significant growth in heroin  abuse in Kenya, Mauritius and Tanzania.
    In South Asia, drug abuse by injection is driving up the  HIV/AIDS infection rate, in particular in Nepal and India.
    In Central American countries, high unemployment and other  social factors continue to make the region susceptible to drug  traffickers and it continues to be a major transshipment point for cocaine originating from South America and bound for the United  States.
    In South America, illegal coca bush cultivation is increasing  in Bolivia and Peru and cocaine production and drug trafficking  have continued to spread in the region.
    The INCB also highlighted the increasing presence of illegal  online pharmacies. It identified the United States and some  countries in Europe as the major markets for the illegal Internet  pharmaceuticals.

"6380",20073377,"Title: Nepal violence _conspiracy_ to deploy army - Maoist chief.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: September 22, 2007 Saturday
Excerpt from report by Janmadev Jaisi headlined ""Nepal Maoist chief speaks of conspiracy to deploy army, citing sectarian violence"" published by Nepali newspaper Rajdhani on 22 September
Kathmandu, 21 September: Maoist Chairman Prachanda has voiced his suspicion that a conspiracy may be afoot to instigate sectarian violence in Kapilavastu [district in western Nepal] and elsewhere in order to deploy the Nepal army.
Prachanda voiced this suspicion in a communique issued after a meeting of Maoist central secretariat members in the capital on Friday [21 September].
Making the analysis that the Kapilavastu incident is a conspiracy by regressive elements opposed to the aspirations for a republic and for peace, he urged all patriotic, leftist and all pro-republican people to remain on the alert.
Maoist Chairman Prachanda asked: ""Could it be that regressive elements are using sectarian violence as an excuse to deploy the army against the people? Such suspicions have arisen from the fact that the sectarian troubles that started in Kapilavastu have spread to Dang [district in mid-western Nepal] via Butwal [town in western Nepal]"".
Describing the incident as planned terrorism against the republic and peace, Prachanda strongly condemned and denounced it.
Maoist senior leader Mohan Baidhya Kiran said information has been received about the army being mobilized in connection with the incident. Kiran said to Rajdhani on Friday: ""We have heard that the Nepal army has also been deployed in the incident; this gives rise to serious suspicions"". He said this is a matter that the seven political parties and the Maoists should discuss seriously.
Kiran urged Muslims, Hindus, Madhesis [people of the south of mostly recent Indian origin], Pahadis [hill-people] and everyone else to be alert against the reactionary conspiracy to instigate sectarian violence and then fish in troubled waters.
Maoist-affiliated All-Nepal Women's Association - Revolutionary Chairperson Jayapuri Ghartimagar also said that anti-people elements had carried out such a conspiracy to thwart the campaign to build a new republican Nepal.
The Maoist central secretariat members at the meeting decided to constitute a martyrs' foundation under the leadership of senior party leader Posta Bahadur Bogati.
[Passage omitted: other proceedings of the meeting]
Stating that it was a welcome move for the Nepali Congress party to opt for a republic, Maoist leader C.P. Gajurel said: ""However, a debate is needed on what kind of republic to go for"". Gajurel was of the view that under the present circumstances, the forward-looking thing to do would be to put an end to the monarchy and then go for a republic.
He also called for comprehensive discussions among the eight political parties to resolve the disputes that have cropped up of late. He said the party stance was that there should also be bilateral discussions with various parties.
Gajurel was of the view that the Maoists' latest decision would bring pressure to bear on the seven political parties to go for forward-looking change. He said: ""This is because they have not been able to say that the demands made by us are wrong"".

  The 35-year-old Hindu Mahasabha member of Parliament from Gorakhpur is one of the most powerful politicians in eastern Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls on May 8. He is the head of Gorakshdham, a deeply revered religious institution whose influence ranges from villagers living in crushing poverty in villages to the king of Nepal.
  Adityanath was arrested in January amid Hindu-Muslim tensions. He is accused of inciting hatred against Muslims, and is supporting BJP candidates in these elections. His arrest provoked widespread violence across many districts in which government buses, Muslim homes and religious processions and even some Hindu shops were attacked.
  Excerpts:
  Q. Should it be good roads or Hindutva?
  A: We have worked aggressively on the issue of Hindutva. We do not favour injustice against any caste, faith or religion, but we will not bear injustice either.
  I have honestly tried to carry out development work. I have brought roads, the Rapti river bridge, resumed air services, train services, got a post office building constructed. Now we are working on bringing a Rs 1000-crore sewage treatment project, and textile and food processing park projects but the State government does not support this work, so it is pending although the money has been approved.
  If we raise slogans of Hindutva, make promises - we can fool people once but not every time. It has to be accompanied by strong and honest development work.
  Q. But you are accused of stoking religious fundamentalism.
  A: If I say I am for Hindu unity, I am not against Muslims and Christians. We want to unite Hindus, who are divided on the basis of caste and social divisions.
  Q. What is your stance on Muslims?
  A: Whoever does not believe in Indian nationalism, Indian traditions, either should not have a right to live in India, or should be treated as a second class citizen - whether he is Muslim, Christian or even Hindu. We are not saying every Muslim is a terrorist or is involved in anti-national activities, but the community is giving shelter to terrorists.
  Q. The CPM says you want to make eastern UP another Gujarat.
  A: I did not give any slogan. The CPM is encouraging Naxalites. We have restricted their activities, and that is why they make such allegations.
  Q. There were religious tensions and rioting here during December and January. How did all that happen?
  A: Saddam Hussein was hanged in Iraq, but the Samajwadi Party decided to hold protests here and traders' shops were attacked. After that, there were a series of incidents in which homes and shops of Hindus were attacked, women were molested. When we protested, I was arrested. Then there was a natural reaction from people.
  Q. Do you regret the rioting that happened?
  A: Many things happened which should not have happened. Government property was destroyed at many places. But it is a matter of investigation who actually the attackers were.
  Q. You have had differences with the BJP.
  A: Look, the differences were over a matter of principles. If we talk of Hindutva, there should be no differences in our words and actions. When that happens, people will dislike us, run away from us. Our point was that the preference in ticket distribution should have been given to people involved with that ideology.
  First I was asked for a list, then that list was made public. I said this is not done. I said there should be action against the people who did this and created a crisis of trust, or we will not be able to work together. But we are together now.

The 80-kilogram statue was carved in Seoul. The original is housed at Zenkoji Temple in Nagano, Japan.
 'We have brought Buddha to Nepal with the hope that peace will now return,' Japanese Buddhist monk Hiromichi Mukaibo said at the ceremony, in an obvious reference to the soaring insurgency-related violence in the once-peaceful Nepal.

  Koirala on Wednesday began negotiating with the Maoist leaders to finalise the draft interim constitution. The meeting is likely to finalize the interim constitution paving the way for forming the interim legislature and interim government.
  The Prime Minister is under pressure to finalise the draft interim constitution after senior Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara on Monday threatened to launch a ""massive movement"" if there was no immediate progress in the political process.
  Mahara had said as the peace agreement was complete, they were surprised by the delay in promulgating the interim constitution and warned of a conspiracy being hatched.
  The Maoist threat was in reaction to Koirala's statement that promulgation of the interim constitution and formation of the interim would be possible only after the management of the weapons of the Communist guerillas.
  The chief of Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Prachanda met Koirala on Tuesday, and told in clear terms that any delay in the promulgation of the interim constitution and formation of the interim government would be viewed as a ""ploy"" to barrier the peace process.
  Koirala was left with no option but to convene the meeting on Wednesday. The constitution was to be promulgated on November. But, the process was deferred due to delay in management of weapons by UN inspectors. The UN officials claimed they would be able to begin the process of arms management after registration of the PLA soldiers, which may now take five to six weeks.

  Out of the 174 people, 52 have been killed and 118 were released after interrogation. One was found to be absconding, Home Minister Krishna Sitaula informed the House of Representatives.
  Sitaula said that the Ministry's internal single-member commission has prepared a report and handed it over to him. 
  The commission, headed by Joint Secretary Baman Prasad Neupane, was formed following the government's agreement with Maoists to disclose the names those who had disappeared.
  Sitaula also informed the House that the status of 602 is yet to be verified. 
  ""The committee has recommended a special mechanism with legal authority to find out the status of those persons and recommend what the government should do in future,"" the Kantipur daily quoted Sitaula, as saying.
  He said the committee has recommended to the government to set up a network comprising the local administration, local bodies, political parties, rights groups and civil society members to carry out indepth study on the alleged disappearances.
  Sitaula said the government will take appropriate initiatives to implement the report. He also informed the House that the government has set up a three-member committee headed by Home Ministry Joint Secretary Pratap Kumar Pathak to suggest ways to implement anti-discriminatory policies and laws of the state.
  He said the decision was taken keeping in view the recent attack on Dalit community members by the so called upper class people in Shaileshwori temple in Doti district. 
  An under-secretary from the Ministry of Local Development and Dalit Commission and representatives are other members of the committee.
  ""We realize there are some problems in our policies, laws and the House declaration against untouchability at the implementation level,"" Sitaula said.

(EURO)TM terror-attacks, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi today termed Bangladesh the 'biggest problem'. Mr Gogoi also cautioned against growing religious fundamentalism, hinting covertly that religious terrorism was being sponsored from Bangladeshi soil. He announced a stringent vigil along the international as well as inter-state borders, including sealing of international borders. Conceding that terrorism was being imported from neighbouring countries, Mr Gogoi told reporters here, ''Assam is the most vulnerable place, with militants taking shelter in its bordering countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar.'' Terming Bangladesh as the 'biggest concern' for the state by far, he said, ''Bangladesh is most problematic. It has large number of terrorists of its own and these groups in turn support North East militant outfits, who reciprocate by assisting in carrying out subversive activities in NE. ''We have to now fight two sets of terrorists, our home-grown ones as well as those in Bangladesh,'' he added. Stopping short of confirming that local groups were used by suspected outside terror outfits in carrying out serial blasts in the state, the Chief Minister said, ''It is evident that no outside group can carry out the blasts without local logistical support.'' Branding religious terrorism as the most dangerous form of terror, Mr Gogoi said, ''Religious fundamentalists give rise to religious terrorism and it can be handled only through consultations with all religious communities and civil society.''

 The nationwide strike called by the student wing of the warring Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) began Wednesday and disrupted businesses and public functions.
However, many people in Kathmandu and elsewhere in the country defied calls to join it.
 Lekhnath Neupane, leader of the students, called Nepalese media organizations Thursday evening to inform that the students were canceling the strike.
 The strike, which was ostensibly intended to disrupt college student union elections across the country, was part of their antigovernment campaign. The elections were held despite attempts at sabotage.
 Major Nepalese political parties have student wings that contest periodic elections on college campuses.
 The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 in an effort to bring down Nepal's constitutional monarchy and replace it with a communist state.

"2376",20044896,"Title: New U.N. resolution calls for tough measures to prevent use of child soldiers.rtf; Date: April 23, 2004, Friday, BC cycle; Text: The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution calling for tough measures to prevent the recruitment and use of child soldiers after Chechnya and Northern Ireland were dropped from a list of ""armed conflicts"" where youngsters are given weapons to fight.
The resolution had been held up for months, initially because Britain objected to the inclusion of Northern Ireland paramilitary groups on a list of armed groups called on to halt the practice, and then because Russia objected to the inclusion of Chechen insurgency groups. Both nations rejected the use of the term ""armed conflicts"" to refer to the disputes.
The resolution adopted Thursday calls for armed groups in six civil wars on the council's agenda - Afghanistan, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Congo, Liberia and Somalia - to prepare ""concrete time-bound action plans"" within three months in cooperation with U.N. experts to halt their recruitment and use of child soldiers.
The Security Council said it would consider imposing ""targeted and graduated measures"" such as an arms embargo or ban on military assistance on armed groups that refuse to start a dialogue, adopt an action plan, and implement it.
The resolution is based on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last November which said children are being recruited and used as soldiers ""on a massive scale"" around the world, with groups in 15 civil wars handing weapons to youngsters.
Despite international efforts to ensure that children under the age of 18 do not take part in hostilities, the report named 22 new groups found to be recruiting or using children as fighters, along with three dozen previously identified groups.
In addition to the six civil wars on the Security Council's agenda, it listed nine other ""armed conflicts"" not on the council's agenda where parties recruit or use children - Chechnya, Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, Northern Ireland, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Uganda.
To satisfy British demands, a correction was issued on Feb. 20 stating that the situation in Northern Ireland ""is not an armed conflict within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions."" The same correction was issued Monday at Russia's insistence, along with a change in the name of those recruiting children to ""Chechen illegal armed groups"" - not ""Chechen insurgency groups.""
The resolution adopted Thursday calls on ""parties in other situations of armed conflict"" mentioned in Annan's report to halt the recruitment and use of children immediately and expresses the council's intention ""to consider taking appropriate steps to further address this issue.""
Since Chechnya and Northern Ireland are no longer considered ""armed conflicts,"" however, this would not apply to groups there - only to the groups named in the report from Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Uganda.
The resolution makes no general call for an end to the use of child soldiers. It strongly condemns the recruitment and use of child soldiers ""by parties to armed conflict"" and other abuses against youngsters caught in fighting including abduction and sexual violence.
It asks Annan to develop a system to monitor and report on the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and to propose measures to control cross-border abductions, recruitment, and illicit trade in natural resources and weapons, preferably within three months.

Officials from the 13 states who met in the southern city of Hyderabad decided to set up two task forces to counter militant activity in the six worst hit states in eastern India.
""It is not simply a police or an internal security problem,"" Home Minister V.K. Duggal told reporters. ""It is a problem which has to be addressed and handled through an integrated approach … through socio-economic development.""
The 13 states would share intelligence gathered by government agencies on the activities of the rebel groups and carry out joint operations against them, he said.
The task force would allow police and security forces of one state to enter a neighboring state to pursue the rebels.
Rebels of the People's War Group mostly target rich landowners and police, accusing them of collusion to exploit landless farmers and rural laborers. More than 6,000 people have been killed since the rebels - inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong - began fighting in 1981.
The rebels are most active in a wide swathe in southern and central India covering the states of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.
The states are also stepping up development projects and creating jobs to prevent unemployed youth from joining the rebel groups.
The officials discussed faster implementation of land ownership laws that would enable landless peasants and tribespeople to own the land they have been renting since generations.
The federal government has promised to help the six worst hit states with additional funds to modernize their police forces and provide better equipment such as armored vehicles to counter the rebels, who frequently use land-mines on police targets.
In 2004, the United States in 2004 added the People's War Group to its list of terrorist organizations whose members can be denied entry or deported from America. The PWG rebels have close links with Maoists fighting to dislodge the monarchy in neighboring Nepal.

Lieutenant General D.P.S. Brar, commander of the army's 16th Corps fighting the Islamic separatist insurgency, ordered the deployment Saturday night amid criticism that so few rebels could hold up hundreds of soldiers.
The dense foilage had reduced visibility to three meters (yards) and troops were treading carefully in case the militants planted explosives, said Faruq Ahmed, a senior police official.
Brigadier Atul Gupte, who has supervised the operation since Tuesday, said troops Sunday were focusing on the forests of Gatti, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of the winter capital Jammu, and had discovered bloodied clothes.
""Possibly a rebel who was wearing the clothes got killed by our firing and his fellows may have buried him in the forest,"" said Gupte, who said sniffer dogs had been brought in.
Officials said the Gurkhas, a battle-hardy Nepalese people known for their warfare with the British military, had been tapped as they had experience in guerrilla warfare.
With the 500 Gurkhas, more than 1,000 Indian troops are involved in the searchout operation, officials said.
""There is no question of pulling out our men unless we are able to determine whether the rebels have been killed or managed to escape the security ring,"" Gupte said.
Indian Kashmir has seen a surge of violence since August 30, when troops said they killed leading rebel Gazi Baba, a Pakistani who allegedly masterminded a December 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that sent tensions soaring between the neighbouring countries.
On Saturday, seven civilians were killed and 35 people were injured when rebels set off a car bomb as an army convoy passed through a marketplace in the summer capital Srinagar.
The Kashmir insurgency has claimed more than 38,000 lives since 1989, according to Indian officials, or between 80,000 and 100,000 according to separatists.

"4891",20066868,"Title: Lebanon ceasefire shaken by Israeli commando raid.rtf; Date: August 19, 2006 Saturday 6:33 AM GMT; Text: The fragile ceasefire in Lebanon was dealt a blow Saturday when Israeli commandos clashed with Hezbollah fighters after raiding a village, as French troops were set to arrive by sea to reinforce UN peacekeepers.
A Lebanese military official told AFP that Israeli helicopters, under the cover of mock raids by warplanes, landed two Hummer vehicles in the moutainous region of Afqa, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Baalbek, a Hezbollah stronghold.
Commandos then drove eastward to the nearby village of Buday where they clashed with Hezbollah guerrillas, he said.
The incident marks the first major clash between the two sides since a fragile ceasefire took effect on Monday.
The Israeli army would neither confirm nor deny the attack, but a Hezbollah spokesman did confirm it.
There were exchanges of fire earlier this week that left at least four Hezbollah fighters dead. 
UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which governs the ceasefire, called for a ""full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive operations.""
It also called for Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon in tandem with deployment of Lebanese troops and a beefed-up UN peacekeeping force in the area.
The United Nations was urging European countries Friday to provide troops to the peacekeeping force, as the Beirut government moved ahead with its deployment, begun a day earlier.
""It's very important that Europe now steps forward,"" Deputy UN Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown said Friday. ""The next few days are going to be very challenging to make sure that we meet this commitment to 3,500 troops, or 7,000 boots on the ground in 10 days from now.""
He said that while Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal had all offered troops as part of the expanded UN force to help shore up the tenuous ceasefire, there was a need to deploy a balanced European-Muslim force that would be acceptable to both Lebanon and Israel.
""We said before that a European-Muslim force (would be preferable) because of both groups' interest in this situation... They bring when you combine them a legitimacy that satisfies both sides to this conflict,"" Malloch Brown said
Israel has made clear it would not accept countries with which it has no diplomatic relations -- such as Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia.
The scope of the force and its rules of engagement were believed to be the major stumbling blocks for European nations, but Malloch Brown said countries now had full details and should be ready to decide on a role.
""Today they're getting the full rules of engagement and CONOPS (the concept of operations),"" he said, adding: ""Now the ball is in their court.""
France has agreed to contribute an extra 200 troops, far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in Lebanon.
An advance unit of an engineering batallion was due to arrive by sea at Naqoura, near the Israeli border, on Saturday morning, a French military officer told AFP.
US President George W. Bush said he hoped France would reconsider its decision and dispatch more troops, noting that ""there have been different signals coming out of France.""
A British newspaper accused France of failing to honor an unspoken deal to provide some 3,500 soldiers for south Lebanon to form the backbone of the UN force and encourage others to contribute.
The Independent wrote in an editorial that ""France seems to have lost its nerve"" by being willing to contribute only 200 troops. 
In Rome, the cabinet gave its approval in principle to the deployment of Italian troops, but Prime Minister Romano Prodi declined to give any firm commitment on numbers saying the matter had ""not yet been examined"".
Besides Italy, several countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Turkey have expressed willingness to contribute troops. Pakistan and Bulgaria have pledged to consider the matter, while Germany ruled out sending ground forces.
The 28-year-old UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the extra troops will be charged with policing the fledgling ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel until the full 15,000 peacekeepers stipulated by the Security Council resolution can be found and deployed.
UNIFIL is seeking to add 3,500 troops to its existing 2,000-strong contingent within 10 days as Israel pulls back from areas it occupied in its devastating month-long offensive.
In southern Lebanon, government troops took up positions Friday in the heavily bombed border town of Khiam, located just seven kilometres (four miles) from the Israeli border.
The town had been a stronghold of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah since Israel last pulled out in 2000 after a 22-year occupation.
Meanwhile, thousands of families displaced by the conflict continued to flock home to the south, as foreign aid groups voiced concern about getting emergency supplies to the most stricken regions t"

He said the assailants had disappeared by the time reinforcements arrived.
Separately late Tuesday, four soldiers were killed and seven others injured when their patrol went over a landmine in the western Kaski district, a security official said.
The rebels, who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy, on Tuesday launched a 15-day transport strike in 14 western districts, stranding hundreds of passengers, according to police.
""We will take whatever action is necessary against the blockade,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters.
Security forces cut down trees and set up roadblocks Wednesday on the 1,040-kilometer (650-mile) highway that connects western and eastern Nepal in hopes of restoring traffic, witnesses said.
""But no bus operators dared to drive on the highway,"" teacher Hira Bahadur K.C., who lives near the road, said by telephone from western Gulmi district.
In southern Chitwan district, Maoists stopped a bus headed to Kathmandu that defied the shutdown and torched it, police said. No one was injured.
Officials warned that remote areas could face shortages of food, medicine and other vital supplies if traffic is not restored quickly.
""Many people have started walking within safe areas,"" said Pyush Raj Regmi, an official with the National Transport Service Organization.

"7291",20118400,"Title: Jail-break in Surkhet, two escape.rtf; Date: July 12, 2011 Tuesday; Text: SURKHET, July 12 -- Two prisoners, one convicted of rape and another remanded on abduction charges, escaped to freedom from the Surkhet jail Tuesday.
Punna Bahadar Shahi, who was serving an eight-year jail term in a rape case, and Bijay Bikram Shah who was remanded on an abduction charge four months ago, escaped from the Surkhet jail by making a hole in the compound wall with a hammer and an iron rod.
""When we did roll call in the morning, every one was there,"" a police man, who called the roll of prisoners, said. ""The two ran away shortly afterwards through the hole they had already made,"" the policeman said.
Circumstantial evidences clearly show that the two prisoners fled the jail, taking advantage of lax security. A security check-post is located just 10 meters south of the broken wall. Similarly, another check-post stands just 30 meters away in the east. Policemen Lila Budha and Top Bahadur Basnet were on duty at these two check-posts. However, none of them saw the fleeing prisoners.
Chief District Officer (CDO) of Surkhet Hari Krishna Poudel has also admitted to the negligence of security personnel in the jail-break incident. ""Our preliminary investigation has held security personnel's negligence as the major reason of the jail-break,"" CDO Poudel said. ""We are investigation if any of security personnel was involved in the incident.""
The presence of hammer and iron rod has also raised suspicion about some security person's involvement in the incident. ""The fact that the sentry did not see the fleeing prisoners has already raised our suspicion,"" an official who inspected the jail after the incident said. ""The use of hammer and rod, which are not allowed into the jail compounds, has added to our suspicion.""
The apathy shown by the District Administration Office of Surkhet towards the demand of the jail administration for setting up a new check-post is also being blamed for the jail-break. ""We wanted to build a check-post exactly where the prisoners broke the walls,"" a jail official said. ""But, our request was not fulfilled by the administration,"" he said.
Some portion of the compound wall of the jail, which was built about 35 years ago, is fragile. To make the matter worse, the jail, which can accommodate only 25 prisoners, was overcrowded with 105 prisoners. ""It was difficult for security persons to keep an eye on all the prisoners,"" a jail official said. ""The two prisoners took advantage of this very fact.""
According to CDO Poudel, Jailer Prakash Neupane and Assistant Sub Inspector Min Bahadur Shahi, who was duty in-charge when the two prisoners escaped from the jail, have been suspended. Similarly, two different probe panels, one led by Assistant CDO Hari Pyakurel and another by Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jay Bahadur Chanda, have been formed to look into the incident.
This is the second jail-break incident in Surkhet in last 10 years. Earlier on January 15 in 2002, during the Maoist insurgency, 30 prisoners, half of whom were Maoist cadres, had escaped from the Surkhet jail.

Three of the arrestees were featured in the Nepal Police's ""Most Wanted List"" for their alleged involvement in smuggling hashish abroad via express courier service. They are identified as Nakul Thapa (40) of Kathmandu, Sitman Gurung (46) of Lamjung and Chij Kumar Gurung (36) of Kaski.
SSP Devendra Subedi said the flying squad of NDCLEU nabbed Nakul from Thamel-based Sky Logistics Courier leading to two more arrests of Sitman and Chij Kumar on Tuesday.
""The three are organised racketeers smuggling hashish to Hong Kong, Japan, France, Netherlands and other Asian and European countries via express courier service for the past 10 years,"" he noted.
According to the NDCLEU in-charge, DIG Birendra Babu Shrestha, the contraband would fetch Rs 42 lakh in the Indian market and about Rs 84 crore in the international black markets.
The police arrested them with 12 kg of hashish concealed in handicraft while trying to export it to Netherlands.
According to SSP Subedi, Nakul used to find the clients abroad and smuggle hashish through his courier service, Sky Logistics Courier, in close association with Sitman and Chij Kumar. The two were key suppliers of drugs to Nakul.
""During interrogation, they confessed to the crime and said they had managed to smuggle 80 kilogram of hashish in the past three months itself,"" revealed SSP Subedi.
DIG Shrestha informed that Sitman and Chij Kumar were also ringleaders in sending people abroad with hashish in the form of capsules swallowed and concealed in their stomach.
""They would receive the money from the foreign clients through Hundi system for hashish,"" he explained.
Police are probing their accounts in various banks based on the cheques and passbooks seized from their possession.

"5276",20065461,"Title: Rebels abduct 11 soldiers in Nepal despite offer of cease-fire.rtf; Date: April 29, 2006 Saturday 8:41 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's communist rebels abducted 11 unarmed soldiers as they headed home from vacation, an army official said Saturday, despite offering the new government a three-month unilateral cease-fire.
The soldiers were taken captive on Thursday from Ramdittha village, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Katmandu, according to Indresh Dahal, a spokesman for the Royal Nepalese Army.
The abduction came just hours after the rebels declared a three-month cease-fire, giving some breathing space to the reinstated Parliament following weeks of often violent protests against the king's royal dictatorship.
On Friday, lawmakers proposed a truce with the Maoists who have battled for a decade to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a communist state as they reconvened for the first time in four years after a campaign of street protests forced King Gyanendra to relinquish control. They also proposed elections for a special assembly that would rewrite the constitution.
The speaker of Parliament, Chitra Lekha Yadav, made the proposals on behalf of Girija Prasad Koirala, the newly named 84-year-old prime minister who could not attend because of ill health.
""It is the people who have brought this change and we have to live up to their expectations,"" Yadav told legislators in the ornate hall.
The proposals, which also included initial talks with the Maoist rebels, were to be discussed in Parliament on Sunday, she said. It wasn't clear how the soldiers' abductions would affect the government's offer of a truce.
The rebels supported the nearly three-week campaign of demonstrations organized by an alliance of seven political parties against the royal government.
On Thursday, the rebels' elusive leader Prachanda said his group's fighters would refrain from attacking government targets for three months to allow Parliament time to ready Nepal for elections for the special assembly.
The current constitution gives the king broad powers to dismiss governments along with supreme command of the army.
The expectation on the streets and the key demand of the well-armed Maoists is that a new charter will limit or eliminate the monarchy's role, ensuring that Gyanendra can never seize power as he did in February 2005.
Legislators also demanded Saturday that the king be stripped of control over the 90,000-strong army, fearing he could use its loyalty to propel himself into power again.
""It is the prime minister who should be the supreme commander of the army and not the king. The existing laws should be amended immediately, and that is what we are going to do,"" said Shivraj Basnet, a lawmaker from the Nepali Congress, the country's largest party.
Army officials could not be immediately reached for comment, but they have previously insisted they work for the government and would do whatever they were ordered.
Meanwhile, at least five soldiers were killed and nine were wounded in an accidental explosion in an army barracks in the western town of Tamghas. There were no immediate further details on the explosion, said Durga Pokhrel, chief administrator in the district where the explosion occurred.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began their violent campaign to replace the monarchy with a communist state in 1996. The insurgency has left more than 13,000 dead.

"7579",20116978,"Title: What_ Do clothes matter_.rtf; Date: April 8, 2011 Friday; Text: Nepal, April 8 -- I began this week's Tech Talk writing about my vast cable collection, which is stored in a huge closet drawer - the cable drawer - that must have over 1,000 different cables by now, collected in just six years of computing in Nepal.
But then I ran across this headline on Orange News.uk: Software Firm Wants Naked Web Coders.
Chris Taylor, the company spokesman for Nude House, a UK-based software house, says, ""As far as I am aware this is not only the first UK office job for naturists in web-coding or web-selling, but is also the first worldwide facility for naturists to earn substantial sums of money from work that incidentally provides them with the capability to work entirely without clothes.""
Mr Taylor follows that up with a reminder, ""Sex does not play a part in naturism"" and customers ""...never know that our providers are nude.""
Apparently, what is ""natural"" in Europe is much different than what is natural elsewhere, as I remember starting my tech career wearing a suit, tie and jacket that conformed to the Company colours: Big Blue. And here of course we have the Daura-Suruwal...
Up until about 1987, IBM had a strictly enforced dress code, and one that had been around since the 50s or so. In the 70s, the corporate attire even included a hat, which, as kids, we would enthusiastically try to knock off the heads of IBM commuters, employing huge snowballs from the banks of slush amassed at each carpool point.
The IBM men, and they were all men back then, would stoically scofflaw our immature behaviour, but deep down inside I suspect they wished they were the ones throwing slush balls instead of commuting to work like well-dressed robots, to spend eight hours or more behind a cold and formidable terminal, in a hermetically sealed computer room with a raised floor and lined with whirring disk drives.
I left IBM long before the coat and tie did, but I did return to a programming centre in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1999, to find my old work chums all programming in temporary cubicles (private offices that have long been replaced by hotel-style workspaces) and everyone was dressed down to shorts, t-shirts, and gym shoes. I felt way overdressed with my Friday casual wear: Dockers, button-down shirt, and penny loafers.
So in the course of a few decades, software development had gone from a stuffy conformity to a loose wear-what-you-like environment, and one in which the change of dress can be correlated to the very products produced.
For example, compare a 1995 Lotus Notes or Outlook to Facebook in 2011, and you can see that informality has become the standard in software interfaces as well as employee dress.
Perhaps it was Steve Jobs that set this trend with his signature black turtleneck and jeans, but there is no denying that what we wear to work is somehow connected to what we produce while we are behind the computer.
Could Euro-naturalism be a further most-extreme extension of this trend?
Or perhaps the trend in fashionwear and software (informal, comfortable, and homey) is just an outcome of the mobile worker bee that hatched in the 80s, when the workforce began extending itself from the traditional office to the new-age home office.
I had almost forgotten my own elation over being part of IBM's work-at-home experiment back then, as I could just connect my terminal to my phone line and then telecommute wearing nothing but my boxers and fuzzy slippers. And 30 years later, little has changed except that now my home is my office and I am now the boss.
But naked? Never.
I would dismiss Nude House's work environment as a click-grabber and publicity stunt, if it had not been for my trip to Amsterdam a few years back, where I was attending a Filipino Independence Day Picnic that reminded me of any mela back home.
There were food stalls, grandmas and grandpas on blankets eating lunch, and the teens were all listening to some really bad pop music blaring from the stage.
Then, lo and behold! Amid a few hundred Filipino families, comes riding the Dutch Naturalists Bicycle Club - single file on bikes of all descriptions, and all riders were buck-naked. Young and old, even toddlers in bike strollers, all sans attire.
The shock and clash of cultures was almost chilling...you could feel it in the air - as the Filipino picnic went dead quiet while the Dutch nude bicyclists shouted out their freedom calls.

The Private and Boarding Schools' Organization of Nepal (PABSON) and the National Private and Boarding Schools' Association of Nepal (NPABSAN) on Sunday announced the nationwide closure of private schools, following a deadlock in their talks with the striking student unions.
""We have been compelled to close all the private schools across the country indefinitely from Monday since the student unions terrorized us with threats and donation demands,"" state-run English daily The Rising Nepal quoted the statement as saying.
The schools were disturbed for about 27 days after the new academic year began in April, and the student unions have locked more than 200 schools' offices and account sections since last week throughout the country, the statement said.
The agitating students refused to open the locks after the government said it was unable to fulfill one of their 68-point demand aimed at exempting all the fees in public schools, at a tripartite meeting held on Friday among the Nepali Education Ministry, the private and boarding school organizations and the student unions.
More than 8,000 private schools that educate about 1.5 million students across the country are facing the indefinite closure.

Lack of education and trafficking in women and children are the main reasons for the spread of the disease, health officials from eight South Asian countries and the United Nations said at a conference in Nepal's capital, Katmandu.
""There were 4.2 million people living with AIDS in South Asia in 2001 compared to 2 million in 1994. The number is growing every year and it getting worse,"" said Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the U.N.'s AIDS agency.
Health officials from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka took part in the two-day meeting, which started Monday.
Delegates reviewed previous commitments to combat the spread of AIDS and planned new, speeded-up strategies to fight the disease.
""Over 4 million people are living with AIDS in the region. Of them, over 1 million are young people, who account for about half of all the new infections, including a growing number of young women,"" said Carol Bellamy, executive director of United Nations Children's Fund.
""Communication and peer education campaigns must be stepped up to ensure that young people are armed with the facts about HIV and its prevention,"" she said.
Delegates also said the disease is largely being spread by migration and the cross-border trafficking of women. About 5,000 Nepalese women work as prostitutes in neighboring India, and many come home with AIDS.

"7828",20116929,"Title: Can we transform public schools_.rtf; Date: April 2, 2011 Saturday; Text: Nepal, April 2 -- Education has been affected both directly and indirectly by the changes in the global economy. The direct impact is seen in the case of those least developed nations whose education system has been shaped by the lending policies of the World Bank and the demands of structural adjustments. The indirect effects have been in the cases of advanced countries striving to cope with the aggregated effects of the decline of the Keynesian welfare-state settlement to the point where public funding of services like education seems no longer feasible at previous levels.
One of the commonest problems education systems around the world are facing as a consequence of globalization is the shift away from state control to privatization and decentralization. Coming back to Nepal, one of the world's least developed countries, more parents are sending their children to private schools than ever before. Nepal is not the only country in this fray. The effects of globalization, marketization and privatization have transcended all the national borders. Since 1995, the number of students enrolled in higher education in Brazil has grown more than 70 percent, with most of this increasing accruing in private colleges and universities, which now account for 71 percent of higher education enrolment. In China, which is even more rigid a state, 500 new institutions of higher education were established between 1995 and 19992. In Australia, nearly one student in three is now enrolled privately. Poland alone has 195 private educational institutes which educate more than 377,000 students. Private business schools unheard of in Europe, are also thriving today, complementing and challenging traditional institutions.
Today, parents pay for schooling rather than the governments signifying that the state is withdrawing away from its role of providing education to the masses. This is happening because private schools give more wide range of choices and the parents make their choice based on their preference and the state-run enterprises tend to be more bureaucratic, with high level of inefficiency, corruption, slow to change and full of red-tape. They cannot meet all the demands of the modern-fast changing world, including the use of new technology without an up-to-date knowledge. In his book, The State & the Governance of Education: An analysis of the Restructuring of the State-Education Relationship, Roger Dale writes: ""There is a fast restructuring of the state-education relationship in Western societies."" This is further articulated by other Western researchers who view that in certain policy areas, the state capacity to act is severely limited in the present social and economic climate.
Thus, privatization has become an undeniable reality. The basic reason behind the sudden increase in privatization of education in Nepal is due to increasing pressure of finances on the state to respond to changing needs of education and training in today's highly competitive world.
Nature of privatization of education differs from country to country. For instance, in The Netherlands, a majority of schools are privately run but the government regulation of these schools is very strict. Also in Denmark, the state specifies the curriculum and use of materials. Undoubtedly privatization of education has opened up the massification process in Nepal enabling more children to go to schools. But at the same time, it has threatening connotations: it conjures up ideas of cost-cutting, making profits from children and the breakdown of the social ethos of education. One of the dangers of unbridled privatization of education in a country like Nepal lies in the social inequality it creates among the masses. The perceived large gap in quality between the private schools, catering to the rich and public schools catering to the poor section, suggests that there is a virtual segregation of education along wealth status. As a consequence of privatization of education, there are already huge disparities in gains of literacy in terms of region, ethnic and linguistic minorities and population groups in Nepal.
The social assessment study conducted by CERID in 1997 had identified 24 educationally disadvantaged groups, which constitute 45 percent of the total population in Nepal. These linguistic and ethnic minority groups tend to have lower school completion rates than the socially dominant groups as they have little or no access to schooling owing to financial pressures. Study on SLC conducted by Kedar Bhakta Mathema & Min Bista in 2006 shows that Yadav, Tamang, Tharu, Muslim, Magar and Rai, among others, are not achieving comparable levels of academic success when compared with socially dominant groups such as Brahmin, Chhetri and Newar.
This is because the lower income groups cannot afford the cost of education -neither tuition fee nor opportunistic costs - as higher income groups can do. In most remote and hard-to-reach districts in Nepal, the situation is "

 Naxalbari, Siliguri (India), 4 April: An official of India's investigation agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has ruled out immediate extradition of the arrested top Maoist leader Mohan Vaidya alias Kiran to Nepal.
 An official who did not want to be named said Saturday 3 April that since there was enough evidence to prove that Vaidya and his companion Narayan Bikram Pradhan were involved in ""anti-social work on Indian soil"", they would be tried in Indian court and could be jailed for at least six months or more as per their offence.
Kantipuronline.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Apr 04
He claimed that with the discovery of evidence that Vaidya had established contacts with Indian militant organizations the KLO and ULFA Kamtapur Liberation Organization and United Liberation Front of Assam , the case could become more ""complicated and sensitive"".
 Vaidya has not yet given his statement to the police, citing poor health condition.
 The Maoist leader, believed to be second-in-command after party chairman ""Prachanda"", was arrested along with Pradhan at the latter's house in Darjeelingmode in Siliguri last Monday. Vaidya was recuperating after a recent eye surgery.
 The official also claimed that about 150 fighters of the KLO entered east Nepal to help the Maoists. He added that in the last two years, the Maoists had been increasing their influence in the Nepali-speaking populace in the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal.

"3945",20052165,"Title: Nepal left leader says monarchy digging own grave.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: July 13, 2005, Wednesday
 Excerpt from interview with chief of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Madhav Kumar Nepal headlined ""Popular agitation moving towards success"" published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 13 July. Interview date and time not mentioned
 [Nepal Samacharpatra] How do you evaluate the situation after the king formed the government under his own chairmanship?
 [Nepal] As a whole the present political situation is not good. The nation is moving through difficult times. People are being victimized. The country is going on a downward spiral. According to our evaluation the country is going towards disaster after the king's 1 February move. We cannot show our face to the world because the king is the prime minister of the country. The king has surrounded himself with corrupt, useless, unqualified and disgraced people.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13 Jul 05 p 5
The king's character, intentions and thought are typified by present day Nepal. The impunity of those in government is crossing all limits. The threats and suppression carried out by those close to the king will certainly make the situation more tense. The process that the king has initiated to taint the parties, victimize democracy and take anti-constitutional steps has seen competition among his sycophants. The situation is such that the king is on one side with all the people on the other. The reality is that the whole world is moving towards democracy but the king towards autocracy. In such a situation, all the political parties and all the classes in society need to unite. The country has reached a stage of being polarized because of the call by one of his servants to choose between the monarchy and democracy.
 [Nepal Samacharpatra] In spite of the agitation by political parties, the king does not appear to be in a mood to step back. The government thinks that it is continuously gaining support.
 [Nepal] People lose their sanity while in despair. The puncture in the claims of success [in the international arena] after the Jakarta summit was seen in the king's speech in Doha where he said, ""We are saddened by the stance of the international community regarding human rights and democracy."" This makes it clear that the king's version of things have stopped selling in the world.
 Statements like ""parties should be declared anti-national elements"" or ""parties will be treated like terrorists"" are expressions from a defeated mentality.
 [Nepal Samacharpatra] There is also a rumour that the king is talking about promulgating a new constitution even while your agitation continues.
 [Nepal] There is a rumour that the king is drafting a new constitution. And many rumours come out to be true in Nepal. The rumour makes sense if we look at the character of our monarchy. These issues must have come in the context of the king's undemocratic and unconstitutional moves and his ambitions. But the political parties have not been perturbed by these moves. They rather believe that the monarchy is digging its own grave in this way. Whatever the size of the stone that the monarchy lifts to use against the parties, it is certain that it will fall on itself in the end. This is the result of those who lose their sanity in work. Those who believe in multiparty democracy analyze the present day as an age of democracy and the end of autocracy. Now, it is certain that the king will be defeated and the people will come out victorious.
 [Nepal Samacharpatra] The king has made his commitment to democracy and human rights time and again. Why not believe it?
 [Nepal] The king's speeches show those commitments. But it is not the speech we want, we need to analyze his behaviour. [passage omitted]

Text of press release by Paris-based organization Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) on 10 May
Reporters Without Borders welcomed the new government's decision on 9 May to abolish a particularly harsh edict on the media, introduced by the regime of King Gyanendra, which it said had posed a very serious threat to the independent media.
The government, headed by Girija Prasad Koirala, should now turn its attention to other laws that needed reform, said the press freedom organization, member of an international press freedom mission to Nepal
""It should purge Nepalese laws, in particular the anti-terror law, the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Ordinance, of all provisions that allow journalists to be jailed for press offences, or that put a brake on the development of independent media,"" said the organization.
""Nepal will come out of this with enhanced standing if it decriminalizes press offences.""
""The government should also guarantee the safety of reporters, who are being regularly singled out for physical assault,"" it added, pointing to an episode in the capital Kathmandu on 4 May when a group of five journalists were beaten up by a group of drunken soldiers, who also tried to seize their equipment.
The international mission, which met representatives of seven opposition political parties in March 2006, had called on them to abolish the media edict when they were returned to power.

"6895",20081491,"Title: Struggle with China focus of Tibetan exile talks.rtf; Date: November 18, 2008 Tuesday 3:59 AM GMT; Text: For two decades the Tibetan struggle against China has been defined by the Dalai Lama's measured path of compromise. Now, it could be abandoned for the long-held but unlikely dream of independence.
More than 500 Tibetan exile leaders planned all-day closed door discussions Tuesday as part of a weeklong meeting, the first major re-evaluation of their strategy since the Dalai Lama in 1988 outlined his Nobel Peace Prize-winning ""middle way,"" which pushes for autonomy but not outright independence for the Himalayan region.
The meeting in this northern India hill town, the base of Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile, was called by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. It comes after he expressed frustration over years of fruitless talks with China and follows this spring's uprising by Tibetans across western China that was aggressively put down by Beijing.
""The middle way approach has failed, it has not produced any results,"" said Karma Chophel, speaker of the exile Parliament. ""In that light, the Tibetan public should come out with an opinion about what to do.""
China insists Tibet has been part of its territory for 700 years, although many Tibetans say they were effectively independent for most of that time. Chinese forces invaded shortly after the 1949 communist revolution and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 amid an unsuccessful uprising.
Large numbers of Tibetans remain fervently Buddhist and loyal to the Dalai Lama. If the exiles choose a more confrontational approach, Tibetans living under Chinese rule would bear the brunt of any government response.
Much of the debate is expected to boil down to two main choices: whether to continue pursuing the politics of compromise or to begin a long-shot independence movement a move almost certain to end talks held intermittently with Beijing since 2002.
Some factions are urging more protests, angrier protests, or more pressure on Western nations, with one very small group even pushing for sabotage of China's infrastructure.
Samdhong Rinpoche, the exile prime minister, told the meeting Monday there would be an ""open and frank discussion."" He said the meeting may not lead to a new approach, and that any new path needs to have ""the clear mandate of the people.""
The Dalai Lama was not expected to attend; he said he did not want to tilt the debate.
Any deviation from current policies was almost certain to scuttle the tenuous ties with Beijing, which has long accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting an independence movement.
Analysts said a strong anti-Beijing sentiment could play into China's hands.
""It seems to be a possible Chinese strategy to make the radical section much stronger,"" said Robbie Barnett, an expert on Tibet at Columbia University. ""It would mean no contacts with China and make contacts with the international community very difficult.""
That would be fine with some delegates.
""We can't live with China,"" said Lobsang Phelgye, 55, who came to Dharmsala from the exile community in Nepal.
The Dalai Lama's envoys to the recent talks with Beijing said in a statement Sunday that they had presented China with a detailed plan on how Tibetans could meet their autonomy needs within the framework of China's constitution.
The plan calls for the protection for the Tibetan language and culture, restrictions on non-Tibetans moving into Tibet and the rights of Tibetans to create an autonomous government.
But China apparently rejected the plan. Chinese officials said no progress was made in the talks two weeks ago, calling the Tibetan stance ""a trick"" and saying it lacked sincerity.
Tibetan envoy Lodi Gyari said the Chinese failed to respond to ""our sincere and genuine attempts.""
China has dismissed this week's meeting as meaningless, saying the participants do not represent the views of most Tibetans.
Chophel, the parliament speaker, said more than 8,000 of 17,000 Tibetans recently surveyed in Tibet said they would follow any decision by the Dalai Lama. More than 5,000 said they wanted Tibetan independence more than twice the number who wanted to continue with the current approach, he said.
The survey almost certainly was done secretly. There was no way to independently verify the results.
After the March uprising in western China, Chinese forces set up camps near major monasteries and important towns, and many monks were expelled from the clergy. Those controls have been heightened recently, according to accounts from recent travelers to the region.
""The people inside Tibet may say as quick as possible a solution is better, anything that will get the Chinese off our backs,"" Barnett said.

"4026",20051833,"Title: India cabinet approves pending shipment of arms to Nepal _ report.rtf; Date: May 10, 2005 Tuesday 7:27 AM GMT; Text: India has decided to send to Nepal a shipment of arms it had delayed after King Gyanendra seized power and will keep future requests for military supplies ""under constant review,"" a report said Tuesday.
The decision was taken by the federal cabinet on Friday last week, the Hindu newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources.
The Hindu said India would send arms and other supplies ""already in the pipeline"" for the Royal Nepalese Army after it suspended them following Gyanendra's decision to dismiss the government and assume power on February 1.
The report comes after Indian media said in April that the government had decided to resume military aid to Nepal unconditionally after a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Gyanendra in Jakarta on the sidelines of an Asia-Africa meeting last month.
Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh however denied supplies would be sent unconditionally in an interview on May 7 to the Hindu and said India would consider sending new arms supplies if the king moves to restore democracy.
India is Nepal's biggest arms supplier and has close ties to the country's military which has been fighting a Maoist rebellion that has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996.
Britain also cut arms supplies to Nepal and joined India, the European Union and the United States to ask Gyanendra to restore democracy.
US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Christina Rocca, is currently in Nepal amid speculation the United States could consider sending M-16 rifles and ammunition to Nepal's military at the end of this month.
US ambassador to Nepal James Moriarty told a public forum in Washington recently that the United States would decide by the end of May on further military assistance to Nepal to fight the Maoist insurgency.
The Rocca visit follows a decision by Gyanendra April 30 to lift a state of emergency in the kingdom, but rights groups note that press freedoms and basic civil rights remain restricted and hundreds of people have been arrested by authorities including former prime minister Deuba on corruption charges.
""If such military aid is given, then it will only strengthen the king's actions in suppressing human rights and attempting to silence democratic opposition,"" said T. Kumar, Amnesty International's Washington-based advocacy director for Asia and the Pacific.
""While we are glad that Secretary Rocca is visiting Nepal, we urge her not to miss the opportunity to send a strong message to the king that the United States will not sit silently and provide any military assistance until restoration of human rights and democracy in Nepal,"" he said.

About 30 mountaineers from United States, Chile, Malaysia, Korea, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Mexico, New Zealand, Canada and 29 Sherpa guides from Nepal were taking advantage of the first break in the weather on the mountain this year.
They reached the summit on Saturday and Sunday afternoon.
Earlier, would-be climbers faced brutal weather. Hurricane-strength winds were reported over the mountain last week, damaging tents and blowing away supplies and equipment.
Four U.S. climbers, a Canadian companion and two Sherpa guides scaled the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit on Saturday afternoon, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry said.
The foreign climbers in that group were Daniel Barter, 49, from Hookett, Washington; Brian Sheddy, 34, from Walla Walla, Washington; Jason Tanguay, 27, from Tacoma, Washington; and Kevin Flynn, 46, from Macedon, New York.
The Canadian was Rauno Hoglin, a 46-year-old truck driver from Delta, British Columbia.
A group of five Chilean mountaineers also scaled the peak on Saturday, while Clive Jones, 40, of New Zealand and Kenton Cool, 41, of Britain were also among the summiters, said Nepalese officials.
On Sunday, the peak was scaled by 48-year-old U.S. climber Thomas Ian McMillan from San Rafael, California, helped by four Sherpa guides.
They were followed by Malaysians Muhammad Mokhtarrudin and Ahmed Reduan Rozali, both 22-year-old students from Kuala Lumpur, and their two Sherpa guides.
Not far behind were several Greek climbers and Sherpas who made the climb to celebrate the Summer Olympics, scheduled to be held in Athens this year.
Susan Todd, 44, from Kingussie, Scotland; Victoria Jack, 51, from Kelmacalm, Britain; Robert Vincent Jen, 51, from New York City; Ian Edward Aitkins, 45, from Kings Lynn, Britain; Sung Bo-shim, 35, and Byung Tai-chun, 46, from Seoul, South Korea; Swiss Kilian Volken, 53; Austrian Peter Gschwender, 42; Canadian Martin Boileau, 38; and Mexican Alejandro Ochoa, 27, were identified as other foreign climbers to scale the peak on Sunday.
Nearly 100 climbers and their Sherpa guides are on the mountain to try their luck before this year's spring climbing season comes to a close later this month.
Since the peak was first scaled by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953, at least 1,300 people are believed to have made it to the summit. Nearly 200 people have died in the attempt.
Officials said there could more climbers heading to the summit in the next few days because of favorable weather.

"3915",20051757,"Title: Nations Lobby for Security Council Seats.rtf; Date: June 14, 2005 Tuesday; Text: For an issue that isn't even on the agenda, the lobbying is intense. Little Benin found itself courted by India and Japan in the morning, and Brazil and Germany in the afternoon. Those big countries are using a summit of smaller, developing nations to garner votes in the U.N. General Assembly for permanent seats on the Security Council.
Germany and Japan are not members of the Group of 77 summit that meets here this week. But they, and India and Brazil, have formed the so-called Group of Four with the aim of obtaining four of the six permanent seats on the Security Council when the body's expansion goes to the vote, probably in July.
Benin Foreign Minister Rogatien Biaou said India and Japan had courted him Monday morning and he met Brazilian and German envoys in the afternoon. Biaou said he told them it was ""too early"" to declare a position on their Security Council aspirations as he had not consulted his African neighbors.
There is broad support among U.N. member states for expanding the Security Council, whose current five members are seen as a post-World War II anachronism. The chairman of the G-77, Jamaican U.N. Ambassador Stafford Neil, said: ""A lot of diplomatic capital is being sunk into this issue, both for and against.""
Germany, Japan, Brazil and India have found themselves in the unrewarding position of contributing more to the U.N. budget than the five permanent Security Council members. But their lack of a permanent seat means they have less diplomatic clout than such countries as France and Britain, who are on the council.
Views on how to expand the Security Council are contentious.
Under the Group of Four's draft resolution, the council's membership would jump from 15 to 25 states, with permanent members rising from five to 11. The G-4 wants to capture four of the new permanent seats. Two others would be reserved for African countries. South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt are said to be vying for them.
The expansion needs the approval of two-thirds of the U.N. member states. Tougher is the necessary vote to change the U.N. Charter, which requires a two-thirds vote and Security Council approval.
The vote is far from clear. At least a third of U.N. members have yet to decide whether to approve the plan, Neil said.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar declared support Monday for Germany and Japan, but most diplomats here are reluctant to publicize their positions.
Plenty of countries oppose the Group of Four plan, perhaps none more vehemently than China, which has sent a delegation to Doha to lobby against it, mainly because it fears an ascendant Japanese rival.
""China is the toughest nut,"" said Nirupam Sen, India's U.N. ambassador. ""They're adamantly opposed to Japan and that means adamant opposition to the expansion resolution.""
Chinese diplomats at the summit did not respond to requests for comment. But Beijing has urged Security Council members not to approve the G-4 plan, complaining Japan never properly atoned for its World War II abuses.
The Group of Four sees July as the best opportunity in a decade to expand the council, and they are lobbying hard at this conference in a Doha hotel. They have made concessions - offering not to wield a permanent member's veto for at least 15 years.
The hotel-lined seafront of this tidy city was in a virtual lockdown Tuesday as dozens of heads of state arrived for the second-ever G-77, also known as the South Summit. Helicopters and patrol boats covered the sea approaches, as motorcades took leaders to their hotels.
Among those presidents expected were Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, Lebanon's Emile Lahoud, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir. Also expected were the kings of Bahrain, Morocco, Nepal and Swaziland and the leaders of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

""Reaching the summit of Lhotse is very dangerous because of steep rock face but the weather was good without strong winds,"" Watanabe, a former office worker from Yokohama, told AFP on her return to Nepal's capital Kathmandu.
Looking cheerful despite her sunburn, Watanabe said she had set her sights on the eighth and 14th tallest mountains, 8,163-metre (26,778-foot) Manaslu and 8,027-metre (26,340-foot) Shishapangma, both in Nepal.

When she was 63, Watanabe became the oldest woman to conquer 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) Mount Everest.
The oldest person of either gender to stand on the tallest point in the world is another Japanese, Yuichiro Miura, who scaled Everest last year at age 70.
But mountaineering remains treacherous, with 63-year-old Shoko Ota, a Japanese who became the second oldest woman to climb Mount Everest, dying on her descent on May 20.

In the one-hour, 45 minute documentary style video that shows masked members of the Sunni insurgent group Ansar al-Sunnah interviewing fighters in Ramadi, the militants lashed out at Sheik Abdul-Sattar Abu Risha, the leader of the effort in Anbar who was killed in a bombing Sept. 13.
""The Americans did not find a more vicious villain. He is a bandit and a thief and they used him for this purpose,"" one of the insurgents said.
Abu Risha died 10 days after he met with Bush during a surprise visit the U.S. leader made to highlight the turnaround in Anbar. He heads the Anbar Salvation Council, also known as the Anbar Awakening an alliance of clans that were backing the Iraqi government and U.S. forces. Al-Qaida front group the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for Abu Risha's killing.
Ansar al-Sunnah said it and other loyal Sunnis are the ones protecting the people in the Anbar province, not the ""enemy.""
""We have come out to support the honest people of Ramadi, those Muslims who do not accept treason or humiliation. They suffered a lot, but they have written heroic stories. Many were killed,"" said one of the militants, who was identified as Abu Rami Al-Hashemi, one of the video's producers.
The video, which could not be independently verified, was posted on a Web site commonly used by Islamic militants.
Other parts of the video show archive footage of the militants firing mortar shells and machine guns and detonating improvised explosive devices at what they are U.S. and Iraqi troops.
The end of the video also shows outtakes including footage of some militants laughing and mistakes made by one militant who forgets his lines. This type of footage is unusual on militant videos.
Ansar al-Sunnah is believed to be an offshoot of another group, Ansar Al-Islam, which is made up mostly of Kurds with close links to al-Qaida in Iraq.
It has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide attacks, including the Aug. 2004 execution of 12 Nepalese hostages and the Dec. 2004 explosion at a U.S. military mess hall in Mosul that killed 22 people.

Text of unattributed report headlined ""Nepal sees 234 political murders, 772 abductions since last year's peace accord"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 22 November
Kathmandu, 21 November: In the one year since the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed between the state and the Maoists, 28 citizens have been killed by the state and 23 by the Maoists, according to figures made public. 
The Maoists and their auxiliary organization YCL [Young Communist League] have between them abducted 495 individuals during that period. There has been no abduction by the state, according to an annual report made public Wednesday [21 November] by the Informal Sector Service Centre (Insec) [NGO]. However, the state has been involved in 115 instances of beating up and nine incidents in which threats were made, Insec said. The Maoists and the YCL were involved in 380 instances of beating up and 183 instances of threat. According to the report, they also seized the property of citizens at 122 different places. 
According to the Insec study, instances of killings, abductions and threat have also been indulged in by the various groups agitating in the terai [southern plains], including the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum [group which says it represents people of recent Indian origin in the southern plains], the Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha [Republican Southern Plains Liberation Front] (Goit and Jwala groups), the Samyukta Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha [Joint Republican Terai Liberation Front] and other groups and unknown parties. Apart from the forum, other groups were also involved in the seizing of property belonging to the citizenry, it is stated in the report. 
These terai groups were responsible for 183 killings, 277 abductions, 53 instances of beating up, 49 incidents involving the use of threats and seizure of property at 157 places, according to Insec. Out of these, 95 killings and 66 abductions were perpetrated by unknown parties. 
It was on 5 November last year that a comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the Nepal government and the Maoists. 
In a press communique issued also Wednesday [21 November], Insec said the Maoists have not taken the rule of law the least bit seriously, and the government, instead of urging them to adhere to the law, only encouraged them by setting them free. 
""The YCL has been true to their Maoist character dating back to the conflict period"", the communique says. 
Stating that a situation now obtains in the terai where one person is killed every day, it drew the attention of the government toward initiating talks with the groups waging an armed struggle in that region and bringing the criminal groups within the purview of the law.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 29 April
Minister for Peace and Reconstruction Ram Chandra Poudel has said that everyone must remain alert to the fact that if constituent assembly polls are not held, democracy will fail and the country will revert to the past situation. Addressing a press conference held today in Birgunj [south-central Nepal] by the Nepal Press Union, Parsa Branch, Minister Poudel, who is also the general secretary of the Nepali Congress, said the issue of republicanism would be decided through constituent assembly polls. 
Minister Poudel said that one cannot bypass the constituent assembly and foist one's decision on the people by saying it is the people's decision. He said the main need of the hour is to create a congenial environment for the people to express their opinion and decision through a constituent assembly. Stating that parliament had still not been able to pass the Constituent Assembly Members Bill, he said that was the reason behind the delay in the announcement [of date for polls]. Minister Poudel asked why the eight parties could not enact the bill through parliament, which is caught up in the tussle among the parties. Stating that one could not be revolutionary just by speaking in a revolutionary manner but that one had to also put it into practice, he said: ""Whose fault is it for not creating an environment for constituent assembly polls, continuing with killings, violence, looting and terror, and then complaining about the constituent assembly polls not being held?""
Having made a leap after the success of the People's Movement II [April 2006], the country is now passing through a difficult phase and there is an environment of political uncertainty, so the unity of the eight parties must be made even stronger under such circumstances, he said.

Text of report headlined ""Ajmal Kasab kidnapped from Nepal before 2006: lawyer"" published by Pakistan newspaper The News website on 15 December
Rawalpindi: A Pakistani lawyer C M Farooque claimed that many people, including Ajmal Kasab, [the only Mumbai attacker captured alive by Indian police] were arrested before 2006 from Kathmandu by the Indian agencies with the help of Nepalese forces.
He said Ajmal Kasab went to the Napalese capital on a business tour. His application regarding his arrest was lying pending in the Nepalese Supreme Court in which a reply was sought from Nepalese forces and Indian High Commission.
While talking to the Geo News, C M Farooque Advocate said the Nepalese forces arrested almost 200 people including Ajmal Kasab before 2006 and his application in this regard was lying pending in the Nepalese Supreme Court in which Nepalese forces and Indian High Commission were made respondents.
The advocate said he wrote letters to Pakistan and Indian governments in this regard. He said that he had also addressed a press conference in Nepal highlighting the issue in which he revealed that the Nepalese forces arrested Ajmal Kasab and many others and held them at an unknown place and that these people would be used for their ulterior designs at some later stage. He said that he had no contact with Ajmal Kasab ever since he disappeared.
The lawyer said he was still pleading the case of Kasab and was to visit Nepal towards the end of this month. The Nepalese Supreme Court had repeatedly issued notices to the respondents to furnish their reply but they did not submit any reply.
Advocate Farooque said he had filed the petition in the Nepalese Supreme Court in February 2008. He said he was running an NGO, 'Voice of Human and Prisoners Rights' and the parents of Ajmal Kasab contacted him for help in this regard after appealing to the Pakistan Government for help.
The people arrested in Nepal had gone there on legal visa for business but Indian agencies were in the habit of capturing Pakistanis from Nepal and afterwards implicated them in the Mumbai-like incidents to malign Pakistan.

Police said, the person has several injuries similar to blast wounds. His face resembled with the sketch of the culprits published by the NIA. The man identified himself as Syed Afjal Taher.
Sources said, the person landed at Bagnan rural hospital on Monday afternoon, with injuries on his left palm, face and leg. ""His left hand was hanged with a sling and head was wrapped with a bandage drenched in blood,"" said a doctor at Bagnan hospital. The man reportedly told the doctor that his hand was aching and asked for medicine.
The hospital authorities asked his name and address but he initially refused to give them details. Since, there were discrepancies in the information he provided, the doctors became suspicious. They informed the local police and during interrogation, the cops also found several contradictory statements.
"" He is now posing as mentally deranged. In every five minutes he is changing his statement,"" said an investigator. Finally, police arrested him in the morning and produced before the Howrah court. He has been sent to police custody for further interrogation.
Sources said, probe revealed that his mother tongue is Urdu. But he has proficiency in Hindi, Nepali and English as well. No document or luggage was found along with him. Police claimed that Taher hails from Banke district of Nepal which is bordering Uttar Pradesh. But the police have not yet established how he sustained injuries and how he landed at Bagnan.
Police have reasons to believe that he was somewhere in south Bengal and was travelling in a Howrah bound local train. On the way due to unbearable pain he got off and was looking for medicine. He opted for rural hospital as he felt it was safe. SP Howrah, Rabindra Nath Banerjee confirmed that Taher has been arrested and further investigation is on.
Meanwhile, officers of National Investigation Agency have rounded up Sunny Sharma from Kolkata outskirts as the investigators believed that Sharma had sent second and fourth mail posing as Chhotu Miya and took the onus of the blast on behalf of Indian Mujahideen.
Though NIA officers said that they are suspicious of how far the mails were original. Cops claimed that the mail was sent from a cell phone using wi-fi connection. NIA is now interrogating Sharma.

and planning to hike electricity tariff soon, and
this year's World Consumer Day (WCD) is celebrated with a slogan 'Bearable Energy for All'.
Similarly, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is also mulling to hike at least 22 per cent in electricity tariff - at a time when the country is under 14 hours of load-sheding - making the energy unbearable.
""We will lobby for bearable energy throughout the year,"" consumer rights activist Jyoti Baniya said, adding that they will force the government to revise the energy policy.
The Consumer Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) today submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal urging him to revise the state policy on energy and make it affordable to poor.
Nepal Oil Corporation is incurring heavy losses due to rising price in the international market compelling the government to hike the prices, confessed the PM.
Soaring energy price is global issue, said secretary of CRPF Ram Chandra Simkhada. ""But the World Consumer Day message is that the governments must think on alternative energy and make them fit to people's pocket,"" he said, adding that Nepal as a least develop country must think on alternative energy available in the country.
""We are largely dependent on petroleum products
but it is high time we revise our policy and promote alternative energy,"" he said.
Nepal has a huge potentiality of hydropower. But only 42 per cent of population is using electricity. ""If the country will not focus on hydropower development, it has no future,"" he added.
Similarly, CRPF also demanded effective law enforcement mechanism to control artificial price hike of essential consumer goods. Consumer laws have identified 29 items including rice, wheat flour, pulses, edible oils and energy (petroleum products and others) as essential goods.
As the country is in political transition, consumer groups also urged the government to protect consumer rights under fundamental rights in the Constitution that, according to the rights group, must ensure food to all and affordable legal service to people.
Currently, the country has 11 laws related to consumer rights but half of them are ineffective. Legal process of Consumer Rights Protection Act is too lengthy and impractical as the law has given the right to punishment to CDOs, who already have excessive duty of administration. ""Therefore, the consumer case takes double the time to finalise,"" he added.

The film, tentatively titled ""Asian,"" is likely to be shot in London in November and would be ready for screening in 2007, Mahesh Bhatt, who is writing the script, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
The film is about a group of young men and women from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries that battle to keep an American company from buying the club where they perform.
The film would bring together actors from countries where political divides have often kept them apart. The most prominent is the case of India and Pakistan, where millions of people love the same kind of music and films, but cultural exchanges have been few and far between because of a long-running and at times violent rivalry.
""I have felt that the aspirations of a region when articulated and given form through a work of popular art like cinema can spur the leaders of this region to work in that direction,"" Bhatt told The Associated Press.
Officials from nuclear rivals Pakistan and India began talks Thursday on easing visa restrictions for each other's citizens in a bid to promote cultural exchanges.
""Asian"" will be directed by Mohit Suri, who has directed the successful films ""Zeher,"" ""Kalyug"" and ""Gangster"" for Bhatt's production house Vishesh Entertainment .

Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai said in an opening speech that the seven-nation BIMSTEC grouping was ""the logical linking mechanism to bring together various interlocking pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that is Asia.""
But plans for a free trade deal to be signed by the five founding members -- Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- were jeopardised Saturday when Bangladesh pulled out after demanding compensation in return for abolishing tariffs.
""Bangladesh is not in a position to sign,"" Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Saturday, shortly after the host nation opened trade ministers' talks by saying an agreement had been reached.
""Bangladesh did not want to be an obstacle to the signing of the agreement so they said -- you go ahead and sign and we can join later,"" Sihasak said.
But with only four of the seven-nation bloc now able to sign, the foreign ministers will discuss Sunday whether they should now aim instead for all seven members to ink the deal at a summit planned for July, he said.
Incoming members Nepal and Bhutan were not part of the trade negotiations and had already been invited to join at a later date.
Sources at the talks said delegates were ""flummoxed"" by Bangladesh's proposal which they said did not outline in detail how they would be compensated.
They said that other member nations, particularly Sri Lanka which has already agreed on a free trade deal with India, tried unsuccessfully to convince them that their concerns could be addressed within the agreement.
Surakiart said in his opening speech that the BIMSTEC proposal, which would slash tariffs to zero by 2012 for the more-developed members and give less-developed nations a further five-year grace period, was part of a trend towards unfettered trade in Asia.
""This network of functional cooperation, while embryonic, has the potential, in time, to develop into an Asian economic community,"" he said, referring to the web of agreements, dialogues and joint projects signed in recent years.
""BIMSTEC is poised to fulfill its promise of bridging South and Southeast Asia and elevating the relationship onto a higher plane of cooperation.""
Nepal and Bhutan were Sunday formally admitted to the grouping, represented by their foreign ministers who both wore nation dress -- Bhutan's Lyonpo Khandu Wanchuk resplendent in a knee-length checkered robe cinched at the waist.
Sihasak said the foreign ministers' talks would focus on establishing a common position on terrorism, and finding ways to cooperate to fight infectious diseases like the bird flu which has swept across Asia.
""It's been agreed that we need to work closer together on terrorism and transnational crime, and infectious diseases like SARS and bird flu. The foreign ministers will discuss how to take this further,"" he said.
""I think they will recognise that the challenge now is not just the traditional security issues.""
The bird flu outbreak has killed 18 people in Vietnam and Thailand and emerged in poultry in eight other Asian nations, only a year after the SARS epidemic caused panic as it swept the region.

 Top party leaders held a three-hour-long sit-in at the main road leading to Narayanhity Royal Palace, residence of King Gyanendra.
Former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, president of the Nepali Congress Party (NCP), said the agitation against the king would continue until he corrected his 'act of regression,' referring to the king's seizure of executive powers in October 2002.
 Several thousand supporters and party activists joined the leaders in the sit-in.
 Earlier, the protesters marched through the streets of the capital shouting anti-king slogans.
 Protesters of the leftist Joint United Front, a member of the five-party anti-king alliance, chanted slogans such as 'Death to monarchy,' and 'We don't want Gyanendra as the king.'
 In October 2002, King Gyanendra dismissed the elected prime minister and seized executive power for himself, angering major political parties that labeled the move undemocratic and unconstitutional.
 For his part, the king says he will return executive powers to people's representatives following an election.
 The parties are demanding the reinstatement of the House of Representatives, or a government of political parties that had seats in the previous parliament.
 The lower house presently remains dissolved.
 The parties began their fresh bout of anti-king protests Thursday last week.
 Meanwhile, Maoist rebels waging an armed struggle to topple the monarchy have called for a three-day nationwide strike in Nepal, starting Tuesday.

"4989",20065391,"Title: Maoists' new stance on arms brings optimism to Nepal peace talks.rtf; Date: October 30, 2006 Monday 11:06 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebels said Monday they would place their weapons under United Nations supervision if the army does the same to revive peace talks and pave the way for elections next year.
""Chairman Prachanda in his informal meeting with Prime Minister (Girija Prasad) Koirala Sunday proposed that our party was ready to lock up all our weapons in a single place under UN monitoring, provided the Nepal Army does the same,"" Ananta, the deputy commander of the rebel army, told AFP.
Ananta, who uses one name, said the proposal by rebel leader Prachanda would leave the rebels unarmed ahead of planned national elections next year.
The multi-party government that came to power in April after mass protests forced King Gyanendra to end direct rule agreed to let the rebels join an interim government to end a decade-old insurgency.
Issues such as arms management and the role of the monarchy had prevented the peace process from moving ahead, but the rebels' proposal has provided a boost, officials from both sides said.
On Sunday, the rebels extended a six-month ceasefire, saying they were ""confident of a peaceful solution with the government"".
A government peace negotiator said it was reviewing the proposal on arms.
""The government is considering the Maoist proposal,"" Labour Minister Ramesh Lekhak, the government peace negotiator, said Monday.
""The proposal means that the rebels would separate their weapons and soldiers. Earlier this was unacceptable to the Maoists. A meeting point should be found soon,"" Lekhak said.
Previously, the rebels had said that they would keep their arms and soldiers together in United Nation's supervised camps, but the multi-party government had said that the rebels must disarm before entering government.
Arms management is essential for elections to take place as planned before May 2007 for a body that will rewrite the constitution, an analyst said.
""The new proposal could be a solution to end the current deadlock,"" said Krishna Khanal, a political scientist from Nepal's Tribhuvan University.
""The government and the Maoists need to ensure that people will get opportunity to exercise their rights to vote in an environment without intimidation,"" Khanal told AFP.
Gunaraj Luitel, a senior news editor with the Kantipur media group, said the rebel proposal was a significant step forward in the peace process.
""I have seen flexibility on their (the rebels') stance on weapons,"" said Luitel, who interviewed Prachanda on Sunday.
""The peace process appears to be back on track and is now closer to a conclusion.""
Since declaring a ceasefire in May, the two sides have held two rounds of high-level peace talks.
This is the third time the rebels and government have tried to hammer out a peace deal to end the conflict that has killed at least 12,500 people since the rebels declared their ""people's war"" in 1996.
Two previous attempts, in 2001 and 2003, failed, plunging the impoverished country back into conflict.

GEOGRAPHY: A landlocked kingdom that is home to Mt. Everest.
The country straddles the Himalayas between northern India and China. It rises steeply from the Ganges River Basin in India and contains high fertile valleys. Home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks.
PEOPLE: 25.7 million, about 90 percent Hindu and 5 percent Buddhist.
CAPITAL: Katmandu
AREA: 147,181 square kilometers (56,827 square miles)
GOVERNMENT: Constitutional monarchy under King Gyanendra. The dismissed government, was led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
ECONOMY: One of the world's poorest countries, more than 80 percent of the population depends on agriculture. Per capita annual income is $213 and an estimated 40 percent of the people live in poverty.
HISTORY: Nepal's royal family has been in power since the 18th-century, leading what was long a secretive, closed society. After a brief experiment with democracy in 1959, political parties were disbanded. In the 1990, dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators were shot by police, prompting a surge of anti-royal sentiment that forced the king to yield most of his authority to an elected government. Gyanendra assumed the throne in 2001 after his brother King Birendra was gunned down in a palace massacre, apparently committed by Birendra's son, the crown prince, who also died. Ten royals were killed.
The government has been fighting anti-monarchist rebels, who draw inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, and have been trying since 1996 to overthrow the government and establish a socialist state. More than 10,500 people have died since the fighting began.

 Brussels: Agalev Live Differently - Dutch-speaking ecology party will continue to oppose US army transports, but it will do so from within the government. The party's executive committee has decided this. Agalev will demand the cancellation of the arms transports accord with the United States. And it will demand further clarifications from the prime minister.
De Standaard web site, Groot-Bijgaarden, in Dutch 25 Mar 03
Last weekend, in a way reminiscent of the Nepal crisis over arms deliveries to the Nepalese government , Agalev again found itself under pressure to quit the government. This pressure was exerted from within the party, from the Greens' more pacifist elements. They wanted their party to bang its fist on the table.
 What had happened was indeed fairly distressing: While Agalev was handing out pamphlets against the arms transports, Agalev Deputy Peter Vanhoutte coolly reported on Saturday 22 March that the transports were still going on. This sparked a discussion about whether or not these transports were new and whether they were only supplying rolls of toilet paper to the marines, or whether they provided direct support to the US war effort.
 Yesterday morning, the Agalev parliamentary groups of the Chamber, Senate and the Flemish Parliament convened to discuss the issue and adopt a standpoint. Yet they failed to reach a joint standpoint. ""This goes beyond the parliamentary groups' competence; we referred the matter to the executive committee's wise judgment,"" a deputy said after the meeting. Some deputies had apparently advocated an unequivocally rigid stance, whereas others thought such a stance to be inopportune. They also discussed many compromise solutions, which all boiled down to the same question: What is the best way to make our voice heard within the government? Some deputies even advocated some sort of nonattendance action so as to paralyse parliamentary business.
 Quitting the government would please the hardcore rank and file, which has been rather vociferous over the past few days, but probably no more than that. The electorate, however, is likely to remember the image of a party that went adrift and quit the coalition for electoral reasons two weeks ahead of the end of the official government term. This would severely damage Agalev's image as a reliable political party and a stable partner and put the party's ambitions to join future governments in jeopardy.
 Thus, the executive committee decided not to quit the government. The party, however, will tighten its standpoint. Agalev simply wants the government to cancel the agreement with the United States - even though it will have to observe a six-month cancellation period. The party hopes that this will send a clear signal to the United States. The Greens pointed out that the accord dates from 1971 and that it was due for revision anyway. The party is being supported by the PS French-speaking Socialist Party , which is also demanding the accord's cancellation.
 Agalev also wants parliament to be given access to the terms of the accord. At present, only the foreign and defence ministers and the prime minister know the content of the accord.
 Agalev is not pleased with Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt's handling of the issue. He stated in parliament that no further arms transports were to take place, whereas it became clear that the transports are still continuing. Agalev does not claim that the prime minister lied, yet it is determined to ask him some nasty questions.
 Finally, the Green party is also worried about the situation in Turkey. If Turkish troops were indeed to invade Iraq, it would like our country to call back its troops currently deployed in Turkey. Prior to the party executive's meeting, Development Cooperation State Secretary Eddy Boutmans said: ""We can do more against the army transports from within the government than from outside it."" The party backed his stance. Dissident Deputy Peter Vanhoutte is also pleased with the position adopted by the Greens.
 Notwithstanding this, the issue is causing the Greens a serious headache. ""We successfully prompted Foreign Minister Louis Michel and Guy Verhofstadt to adopt the most peaceful standpoint of all European countries, yet, instead of stressing this achievement, we are now making a lot of fuss about these army transports that are hard to stop anyway. We achieved nine-tenths of our goals, yet Agalev now finds itself in a crisis situation over this remaining one-tenth. I would call this a serious case of self-flagellation,"" one prominent Agalev figure said.

"6225",2007762,"Title: West Bengal 's sex workers' remarkable fight against HIV.rtf; Date: December 30, 2007 Sunday 1:15 PM  EST; Text: Kolkata, Dec. 30 -- Sex workers of Sonagchi, the single largest brothel in India, are doing a remarkable work in prevention of HIV infection and human trafficking by organizing camps for sex workers of West Bengal and asking them to fight for their rights. 
  Under the banner of Durbar Mahila Samannay Committee (DSMC), which organizes seminars, sex workers and others, who are directly or indirectly linked to the movement, discuss two major issues of HIV infection and human trafficking. 
  West Bengal is the state with highest number of HIV infected patients. The estimated figure is 150 thousand. At least 9000 sex workers including 3000 flying sex workers are considered as the most vulnerable to HIV infection. 
  Rajeev Shukla, Project Director, West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society said that Bengal's open border with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, are the biggest challenge for HIV infection. Migrants from these countries carry the virus and as they are not traceable for treatment they further spread the disease. 
  Activists at DSMC think that the awareness could only be spread through movement. 
  When 'Use Condom' campaign was launched there was hardly any taker for that. Sex workers were more vocal about violence against them, they said. 
  ""Earlier police raids were so frequent that the numbers of clients were very poor. The fear of loosing them, used to stop us to ask for the use of condom. Police used to think sex workers encourage human trafficking which was an absolutely wrong notion,"" said Bharati Dey, who has been a sex worker for the last 30 years. 
  To stop human trafficking in sex trade, a self-regulatory board has been established by the sex workers. 
  The board works as a filter and it checks whether the new girl joining the trade is an adult or a minor. This board also tries to find out if any new girl joining the profession is under any pressure to do so. 
  ""This has been very successful way to check human trafficking, police raids have also reduced considerably,"" said Swapna Gayen, who too is a sex worker in Sonagachi for over two decades. 
  During the seminars, sex workers also discussed new amendments proposed in the existing laws, which they feel would criminalize sex work. 
  There have already been protests against the new amendments, which criminalize clients of sex workers. Sex workers feel that such amendments would in return make the entire trade as a crime.
  ""It will criminalize the entire trade. The new amendments will force the trade to go underground,"" said a legal expert Tripti Tandon.

 India has pledged assistance to Nepal in fighting the armed rebellion, giving it attack helicopters and other military hardware along with training for Nepalese army personnel.
 On the other hand, the Maoist rebels have cross-border linkages with powerful Indian insurgent groups, from which they get assistance.
Nepalese rebel leaders have found shelter in India where they operate more or less freely.
 The Nepalese prime minister will also seek to overturn India's opposition to the United Nations having a role in a new round of cease-fire and peace talks with the Maoists, who have shown interest in a U.N. role.
 Deuba will hold discussions in bilateral issues such as peace and security, border management and use of water resources, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Prakash Sharan Mahat said Tuesday.
 Deuba will also reassure Indian investors about the security situation in Nepal in the wake of the Maoist rebels' threats of closure of business houses and industrial ventures across the country.
 Critics at home have warned Deuba against signing deals with India at a turbulent times such the one Nepal is passing through now, but Mahat said the prime minister may sign a couple of agreements, including on cooperation in the field of culture.
 The minister of state said Nepal and India are expected to exchange notes on large water resource projects such as Pancheswor and Upper Karnali.
 On the eve of Deuba's visit, India has announced imposition of a new duty on Nepalese imports of petroleum products, Nepalese newspapers reported Wednesday.
 Nepal, which gets all of its petroleum products from India, says the duty is against the 1974 Nepal-India accord on supply of petroleum products to Nepal.

Uttar Pradesh Inspector General of Police R. K. Tiwari said the rebels, known as Naxalites, had placed explosives beneath a small bridge over which the bus was due to pass.
Two police jeeps, moving ahead of the bus, crossed the bridge unharmed but the explosion occurred as the bus approached the bridge, he said.
The policemen were their way to conduct a search operation in the area after other security force members were killed in a Maoist attack earlier in the week.
Senior police officials had reached the area, which had been cordoned off for further investigation, the report said.
Maoist rebels, some of whom are believed to have operational ties with Maoists battling in Nepal, are active in seven of India's 28 states.
Thousands have died since the 1960s in rural India in uprisings by the militants, who say they are fighting on behalf of the poor against wealthy landowners.

The European Union (EU), a major bilateral donor to the Himalayan kingdom, has called upon His Majesty King Gyanendra to declare a truce and uphold its international human rights and humanitarian obligations to create what it called a conducive environment for peace building in the country. 
The statement came in response to the Maoist rebels' announcement to extend their unilateral truce by one more month to find a political solution to the on-going conflict. The royal government has, however, been refusing to reciprocate saying that the Maoists can't be trusted.
In the statement, the EU also called upon the Maoists to announce an immediate cessation of violence and to uphold their commitment to human rights and the rule of law as agreed upon with the seven political parties. Only last month, the Maoist leadership signed into a document with the seven party opposition alliance saying that they now agree to join the competitive multi-party polity, respect human rights and press freedom, among others.
The opposition parties and Maoists said they will launch separate struggles against what they call an ""autocratic monarchy"". The EU said a complete cessation of hostilities between the Maoists and the government was a crucial step towards a lasting peace (in the country). The EU also stressed on the need for the United Nations to help to broker and monitor a ceasefire agreement.

Nearly 2.3 million people in 16 districts of Orissa state, have been hit by severe floods which have submerged hundreds of villages after the Mahanadi River and its tributaries overflowed their banks following weeks of heavy monsoon rains, officials said.
Two more people died Wednesday, taking the toll in the state to 19, while the countrywide death toll from this year's monsoon deluge rose to more than 600, said Pratip Mohanty, the state's top relief official.
Rivers have broken embankments at more than 600 places and cut off roads in at least 560 places, he said.
Mohanty said relief supplies had reached all flood hit villages.
However, scores of angry people protested outside the Kendrapara district administrator's residence, claiming food and other relief supplies were yet to reach many areas.
Kendrapara, a coastal area that has been the worst hit by the flooding, is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the state capital, Bhubaneshwar.
""My children have not eaten anything for the past two days. Relief supplies from the government haven't reached. Will they provide food after our death?"" said Baidhar Behera, 45.
Behera said he has been camping with his wife and four children on a high river embankment since flood waters submerged his house Saturday. Incessant rains and cold winds over the past four days have worsened their plight, he said.
Tens of thousands of others were sheltering in the open or under tents made of plastic sheeting rigged on bamboo poles.
This year's unusually heavy monsoon rains have also battered India's neighbors.
Incessant rains, lightning and waterborne diseases caused by flood waters have killed more than 1,200 people across South Asia, including at least 236 in Pakistan, 216 in Nepal and 181 in Bangladesh.
The monsoon season, which began in June, ends in September.

The notice was issued after police failed to arrest Basnet within seven days of the issuance of an arrest warrant, according to registrar at the district court Bhishma Raj Prasai. Prasai said Basnet's property would be frozen if he doesn't turn up at the court within 70 days.
DSP at Morang District Police Office Deepak Thapa said the 70-day notice has been handed over to Basnet's family on Monday but argued that he cannot turn up at the court in the period as he is also being tried for the court attack on Avishek Giri a few days before the attack on Dhakal.
The district court had earlier sent Biratnagar Youth Force in-charge Rohit Koirala and member Manoj Rai to judicial custody for further investigation into the case relating to abduction and attempted murder of Dhakal.
Dhakal was abducted from Traffic Chowk, Biratnagar on June 5 at night and brutally thrashed for writing news reports against Basnet. Morang district chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) had filed a complaint against Basnet and his accomplices at District Police Office, Morang a day after the attack.
Journos slam police probe team report
Meanwhile journalists of Sunsari and Morang have slammed the police probe team formed to investigate possible links between Basnet and DSP Sahakul Thapa for giving clean chit to the DSP.
Thapa was found to have had repeated telephone conversations with Basnet immediately after the attack on jailbird Avishek Giri on the district court premises and on journalist Dhakal over a month ago.
Police had formed a high-level probe committee under Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Koshi Zonal Police Office Mingmar Lama after the phone call details of Thapa and Basnet were made public.
The probe committee's report says the conversations were about security arrangement for the visit of UML leader KP Oli to Biratnagar.
""The conversation was about the security arrangement for KP Oli and DSP Thapa had advised Basnet to immediately surrender to the authorities,"" Deputy Inspector General (DIG) at the Eastern Regional Police Office Binod Singh said. ""There have been no wrongdoings on DSP Thapa's part according to the investigation,"" DIG Singh added.
However, Oli was out of the country at the time and chief of the organizational front of Morang UML Rishikesh Pokharel said Oli had no formal schedule to visit Biratnagar over the past one-and-a-half month.

""We look enormously, and we always react emotionally. Fear breeds fear. But I must repeat, India is not the enemy of Pakistan and we are not the enemies of the Indians,"" Zardari said in an interview to a French daily.
Zardari said ""the current tension created fear. Of course, some Pakistanis cannot help but remember that India has 4800 tanks.""
""The only border crossed by these tanks is ours. For reasons of relief, they cannot enter Bhutan, or Nepal, or China. We call the leadership of the region to precisely overcome this fear,"" he said.
Zardari repeated what he said on September 20: ""I put myself in the land corpse of my wife. My heart cries tears of blood. I ask you to turn this pain into strength. We are a nation courageous and determined. The death has not taken on us. Pakistan is our country and save us. And I hope that Europe will help us.""
He said that Pakistan pledges to pursue, arrest, try and punish anyone involved in the horrible massacre of Bombay. But we put the world on guard against hasty judgments and inflammatory statements.
""India is a nation that has reached maturity. It is a stable democracy. Pakistanis appreciate what India has contributed to the cause of democracy in this region. But popular anger fueled by the terrorist attacks in Bombay can be a bad advisor,"" Zardari added.
""India, Pakistan and the rest of the world must work together to eradicate these terrorists who have spread death in Bombay, which in the past have attacked New York, London and Madrid, which destroyed the Marriott Hotel Islamabad last September,"" The News quoted Zardari, as saying.

"6255",20071997,"Title: Indian PM hopes for lasting treaty with Pakistan.rtf; Date: January 8, 2007 Monday 1:14 PM GMT; Text: Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Monday he hoped India and Pakistan would eventually be able to sign a long-term peace treaty.
""I earnestly hope that relations between our two countries become so friendly that we can generate an atmosphere of trust between each other and that the two nations are able to agree on a treaty of peace, security and friendship,"" Singh said.
His comments came ahead of a two-day visit to Pakistan by Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, beginning on January 13.
He is due to invite Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to New Delhi for a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) conference in April 2007, and the visit will also include a review of the peace process launched in January 2004.
Singh said commercial ties between the eight SAARC members -- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- could guarantee durable peace.
""India cannot be a prosperous, dynamic economy and a stable polity if our neighbourhood as a whole is also not economically prosperous and politically stable,"" Singh told a conference of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries.
""And similarly, our neighbours cannot prosper if India does not do so as well. There are enormous opportunities for promoting mutually beneficial cooperation in South Asia.
""To exploit these opportunities, the nations of South Asia have to work sincerely to control the scourge of terrorism and extremism,"" he said.
Pakistan's foreign ministry said such a peace treaty with India would be possible only after a resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
""Once we are able to resolve the long-standing issues including the most important issue of Jammu and Kashmir, we can move towards it,"" ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told reporters.
""Indian Prime Minister has talked about a treaty of friendship sometime back. He has talked about in the context of something that may take place at a later stage in future, not immediately,"" she said.
""It is his future vision for South Asia,"" she added.
India has forged soft-trade regimes with South Asian neighbours such as Sri Lanka, but so far hopes for a preferential trade agreement eludes India and Pakistan due to bilateral bickering.
The two estranged neighbours, however, last year set up joint chambers of commerce to find ways to enhance bilateral trade, and Singh called for greater efforts to bolster regional commerce.
""I dream of a day when, while retaining our respective national identities, one can have breakfast in (India's) Amritsar, lunch in Lahore (in Pakistan) and dinner in Kabul,"" Singh said.
New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming and training Islamic militants battling its rule in Muslim-majority Indian Kashmir and sponsoring attacks elsewhere in the country.
More than 44,000 people have been killed since the 1989 outbreak of a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.

""Our revolution is not over yet.
We have completed only half our task,"" Baburam Bhattarai, the rebels' second-in-command, told a cheering crowd at the Tudikhel Open-Air Theater in heart of the Nepalese capital.
The theater, festooned with red flags, was packed to capacity. Rebel recruits, many wearing red headbands, were directing the crowds.
Security was tight with police posted throughout the capital to prevent any violence. But the rally - which the government allowed - was peaceful.
Last weekend, Bhattarai emerged from hiding and made his first public appearance in years to take part in planned peace talks with the government.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
But it was still not clear when the peace talks would take place. Bhattarai has said the government must first free rebel supporters still in jail, as agreed by the two sides. The rebels also claim their supporters were being harassed.
""Despite the cease-fire, our supporters and sympathizers are still harassed by the army. They have not released our people and made public information on those missing while they were still in custody,"" said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a rebel leader.
The rebels are demanding an interim government and an election of a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.

"5747",20073349,"Title: US envoy assesses ties in first interview with Nepal press.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: September 18, 2007 Tuesday
Excerpt from report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 18 September
Her Excellency Nancy J Powell is the new ambassador of the United States of America to Nepal. Prior to her present assignment she was US Ambassador to Pakistan, Ghana and Uganda. She has also served as Deputy Chief of Mission at the US embassy in Bangladesh and Togo. She was Consul General in Calcutta and also Political Counsellor in New Delhi. She has worked as Nepal Desk Officer and Refugee Assistance Officer in State Department, Washington DC. She has studied French, Nepali and Urdu.
Her Excellency Powell talked to our sister publications The Kathmandu Post and Kantipur on various issues ranging from the CA [constituent assembly] polls, the Maoists, Madhesis to Bhutanese refugees. This is her first interview to Nepali media after assuming the position of the ambassador of the USA to Nepal.
Excerpts
Q: How do you assess the current social and economic situations in Nepal?
Nancy J Powell: It has been 25 years since I left here. I have come back a number of times maybe seven or eight times in between. So, it was not a complete shock. I had seen some of the changes during that time. But I have not been able to get outside the valley. I am looking forward to seeing what changes I will see in Terai and hills.
At that time it was impossible to go to the United States from Nepal. If an American needed money, they needed to come and talk to me, how to get money from his family. Now they can pick up the phone and talk to their family. There was no television when I was here before. Now I am able to watch President Bush's address live on television. It is a very different phenomenon from having to listen to President Regan as I did back in 1981 when he gave his inauguration speech in the short wave. So, I think there have been many changes since then. It has entered the global market place, many tourists from different places are coming now. I think those are the big changes that I see in Kathmandu.
[Q] What about political changes in Nepal?
[A] As you might imagine, when I came in 1980 the topic of conversation was referendum. The discussion was whether to go with multiparty system or continue with Panchayat [local self government] system. A significant amount of changes have taken place in politics since 1980. Now, the constituent assembly elections are coming closer. However, as an American it is little hard to understand that there is not much of campaign going on here. In my home state candidates are already campaigning for 2008 elections. But here with less than 70 days to go, I do not to see the candidates outside the valley.
[Q] What could be the reasons behind the candidates and politicians not going for the campaigns?
[A] I think there are obviously a number of reasons. Security concern is very, very real for many people to getting out. The procedural issues still have to be resolved in terms of where the constituencies are, and the parties need to name their candidates once they know where their constituencies are. So, there are still some procedural issues but the security is going to have a major impact.
[Q] Ambassador Moriarty was speaking frequently in public against the Maoists. You have not been as vocal and critical at least in public. Is it because you have different working style or is it because of the US policy to slow down criticism against the Maoists?
[A] I think it is difficult to comment for someone who is still relatively new here trying to understand what is said and what it means, which can sometimes be two different things. It is hard, as a newcomer to understand what the Maoists' priorities are and what their programme is. There seems to be a great deal of contradictions. It seems they are speaking to different audiences with different messages.
We are still receiving reports of intimidation of the candidates who are campaigning. There was a story on the press yesterday, very horrible story about a man who was slit for campaigning. We certainly have reports even from some Americans who have been approached in their homes here and money and food was demanded. I think those things are going on much more in rural communities. The violence in Terai, whether it is originated by the Maoists or by other groups that are inspired by their tactics, these things are not part of politics. Election should provide everybody an opportunity to present a view, and have the people of Nepal provide their answer in the form of vote. That is what mainstream politics means to me and not the continuation of coercion that we see in some of the media houses here in Kathmandu. The labour tactics they are using here are not a part of labour union politics from where I come from. So, the concerns we have is whether their commitment to mainstream politics is genuine or not.
All of those involved in violence is something that the United States condemns. There is recognition on our part that this is not "

'The UCPN (Maoist) is opting to fulfill its political vested interest by keeping cantonments of combatants as it is', leader Poudel added.
Speaking at a press conference organized by Reporters' Club Lumbini in Butwal on Saturday, leader Poudel further said the UCPN (Maoists) should come up with commitment to multiparty democracy by entirely entering into peaceful political mainstream in line with the spirit of 12-point pact.
Nepali Congress has never been the obstacle in expediting the tasks of bring the processes of peace and constitution to logical conclusion on time, Poudel claimed, adding that anyone's leadership will be acceptable to accomplish these tasks.
Leader Poudel accused Prime Minister Jhalanath khanal of bringing the country to hostage for seven months by toppling own party-led government sticking that peace and constitution would not be delivered without Maoists' support.
He had completely failed to expedite ahead these agendas, leader Poudel alleged.
He made it clear that the Nepali Congress will not be carried away by the agenda of specific person or party, hinting that the agendas of peace and constitution within the stipulate time of May 28 will be materialized if all sides are honest to that end.
Nepali Congress has not made any official decision to again extend up the timeframe of Constituent Assembly (CA) if peace and constitution making processes are not completed by May 28, he informed.

"5125",20061882,"Title: More than 100,000 defy curfew and protest on Katmandu 's outskirts.rtf; Date: April 21, 2006 Friday 10:44 AM GMT; Text: A massive crowd of protesters rallied on the outskirts of the Nepalese capital on Friday, defying a government-imposed curfew a day after security forces opened fire on demonstrators in a deadly display of force.
Three separate groups of marchers each in numbering in the thousands converged on an area on the western edge of Katmandu called Kalanki, where police shot three demonstrators dead on Thursday and wounded dozens more. An Associated Press reporter at the scene estimated the crowd at more than 100,000.
The demonstrators were in an uneasy standoff with security forces that have ringed the city and have been issued with shoot-to-kill orders against anyone who tries to enter the curfew zone.
The death toll from two weeks of often violent demonstrations against King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power 14 months ago rose to 14 on Friday after a protester shot by police on Thursday died.
At Kalanki, protesters claimed the area with a message scrawled in large red and white letters on the pavement, ""Martyrs' square, long live the martyrs.""
They waved the flags of opposition political parties and chanted, ""Long live democracy! The blood of the martyrs will not go to waste!""
As the tension grew, an Indian envoy who met with King Gyanendra on Thursday said he expected a ""major announcement"" on Friday that could defuse the situation.
""It is our hope and expectation that perhaps by the end of the day some major announcement will be made,"" Karan Singh told reporters Friday after briefing Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his visit to Nepal.
""We are hoping that there will be some major step toward reinstating democracy,"" Singh said. He gave no other details.
Gyanendra, who seized absolute power 14 months ago claiming it was necessary to defeat a long-running Maoist rebellion, has come under intense pressure to move back toward democracy.
The crisis has escalated steadily since a general strike began two weeks ago and protesters hit the streets daily, leaving the Himalayan country paralyzed and at its most volatile since the king seized power.
Government notices issued early Friday said the 9 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew must be observed in Katmandu, its suburbs of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and in the resort town of Pokhara, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the capital.
The notices warned people to stay indoors during the curfew and said those who violate it will be shot.
They said the curfew was imposed ""to protect the people, property and peace.""
The protester who died at a hospital Friday was among 26 people shot at Gulariya, 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Katmandu, during Thursday's protests.
He was the 14th person killed by fire from security forces since opposition parties launched the general strike on April 6.
A Defense Ministry statement said security forces had to fire on Thursday because the situation was getting out of control.
It said 13 policemen were wounded in clashes with protesters who vandalized government offices and tried but failed to set them on fire.
At the Model Hospital, where many of the wounded protesters including three of those killed were taken, doctors wore black bands to protest the shootings.
""It was terrible,"" said Dr. Sarita Pandey. He said 66 wounded people, eight in critical condition, were brought in Thursday.
He said the injured included a 10-year-old boy with a gunshot wound and 5-year-old beaten by police.
About 100,000 people walked from surrounding villages to march peacefully along the main road that circles Katmandu, littered with bricks and burning tires.
A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to policy, said Friday's curfew was necessary to prevent more violent protests.
Katmandu residents rushed to markets for food and other supplies before the curfew began. Shortages of fresh food and cooking fuel continued due to the general strike.
Notices posted around the city asked government workers to report to work before the curfew began.
Associated Press writer Matthew Rosenberg contributed to this report.

"7253",20093001,"Title: World's biggest animal sacrifice' held in Nepal.rtf; Date: November 24, 2009 Tuesday 11:53 AM GMT; Text: Up to a million Hindu devotees gathered Tuesday in a village in Nepal to witness the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of animals in a mass sacrifice that has drawn widespread criticism.
Worshippers travelled long distances, many coming from neighbouring India, to attend the two-day Gadhimai festival, which honours the Hindu goddess of power and takes place once every five years in southern Nepal.
A huge cry of ""Long Live Gadhimai!"" went up after the village temple's head priest launched the event with the ritual sacrifice of two rats, two pigeons, a rooster, a lamb and a pig.
The crowd then rushed to a nearby field where 250 sword-wielding butchers began the mass slaughter of around 20,000 buffalo, brought by devotees to be sacrificed near the holy temple.
""This is a very special day for Hindu devotees,"" head priest Mangal Chaudhary Tharu told AFP as the festival began.
""All the people who came here to worship Gadhimai have been waiting a long time for this day. I am very proud to be part of this event,"" added Tharu, the fourth generation of his family to serve as a priest at the temple.
An AFP reporter at the scene said up to a million devotees were crammed into the area for the festival. Many were from India, where some states have banned animal slaughter for religious purposes.
Chanchal Shah, a 55-year-old farmer from the northern Indian state of Bihar, travelled to Bariyapur by tractor with dozens of relatives to sacrifice a buffalo in thanks for the birth of his grandson.
""We have come to celebrate the birth of my daughter's son,"" Shah told AFP.
""She got married two years ago and I had promised I would sacrifice an animal after she had her first child. I know that sacrificing is a bad idea, but I am scared the goddess will be angry if I do not keep my promise.""
Animal rights activists, who have waged a vocal campaign to have the festival stopped, say they believe their message that sacrifice is cruel is beginning to be heard in deeply conservative, majority-Hindu Nepal.
Their cause is supported by the well-known Indian animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi and by the French film star turned campaigner Brigitte Bardot, who this month wrote to Nepal's president urging him to ban the practice.
But the government has refused to put a stop to what it says is a centuries-old religious tradition.
Mahesh Yadav, a Nepalese farmer who arrived with a black goat tethered to the back of his bicycle, said he wanted to thank Gadhimai for giving him a son.
""I had seven daughters in a row so I promised the goddess I would sacrifice a goat if she gave me a son,"" he told AFP.
""Eight years ago the goddess listened and my son was born.""
The buffalo slaughter took place in a field surrounded by a ten-foot (three-metre) wall, and will be followed on Tuesday by the ritual sacrifice of around 300,000 goats, sheep and birds.
Many festival-goers scaled the wall to get a better view of the killings, carried out by volunteers.
Armed police were deployed around the temple grounds, but the event passed off mainly peacefully.
Jaya Lal Thakur, a 34-year-old local barber, said he paid 210 rupees (three dollars) for a licence to work at the festival and had already slaughtered dozens of buffalo.
""This is the second time I've slaughtered buffalo at the Gadhimai festival. I don't get paid to do it but I believe it will bring me salvation,"" he told AFP.
Nepal's government has provided 4.5 million rupees (60,000 dollars) in funding for the festival, a lucrative event for organisers, who sell the hides to contractors after the slaughter.
The meat is distributed among local people, some of whom set up stalls selling sweets and drinks.
Authorities have banned the sale and consumption of alcohol in the area, but reports said five people including one Indian national died over the weekend after drinking home-brewed alcohol.

"4124",20054193,"Title: Thousands turn out to fete Nepal king on birthday amid protests.rtf; Date: July 7, 2005 Thursday 3:01 PM GMT; Text: Thousands of Nepalese turned out Thursday to fete King Gyanendra on his 59th birthday amid protests by students and radio journalists against the monarch's power grab in February.
Cultural programmes were held in major centres across the country, including Kathmandu where thousands of school pupils, government employees, political party leaders, activists, film actors and others staged a rally in support of the king
Government offices and educational institutions were shut and the authorities freed 191 prisoners from jails across the country to mark the occasion, state radio said.
Gyanendra was enthroned in June 2001 after a drunken Crown Prince Dipendra gunned down his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, and seven other royals before shooting himself.
On February 1 Gyanendra seized absolute power in the Himalayan kingdom after sacking the elected government for failing to curb a bloody Maoist insurgency.
He justified his move by saying he had to stop the country from sliding into anarchy. However, the country's main donors criticised the power grab and India and Britain suspended their military aid.
Students, political groups and journalists have staged protests against the king in defiance of bans on public demonstrations, which were eased when a state of emergency imposed on February 1 was lifted at the end of April.
A group of students shouted Thursday anti-king slogans in the capital, triggering brief scuffles with police but there were no arrests. Supporters and activists of the Nepal Student Union said they would later burn an effigy of the king to protest his power grab.
Broadcasters, meanwhile, defied the ban on news bulletins slapped on private FM radio stations when Gyanendra took power to broadcast reports on the king's birthday.
""Most of the country's 47 private FM stations, except some pure entertainment ones, aired news on activities relating to King Gyanendra's birthday Thursday evening,"" said Ghamraj Luintel, spokesman for the Save Independent Radio Movement (SIRM).
""We now have to wait and see how will the government respond,"" he said.
Government officials say the private media has fallen prey to Maoist propaganda and has fuelled the insurgency with ""uncontrolled"" reporting.
The Communications and Information Ministry last month warned that the private stations would be punished if they defied government guidelines on press censorship.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ), the umbrella body representing the private media, says more than 2,000 reporters have lost their jobs since Gyanendra's power grab, with several news outlets shut down.
FM radios have been airing purely entertainment programmes and those related to social issues such as health and community development.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting to establish a communist republic in the Hindu kingdom since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed nearly 12,000 lives.

"862",20032438,"Title: Nepal 's Maoist rebels and govt to hold first round of formal talks.rtf; Date: April 27, 2003 Sunday; Text: Nepal's government and Maoist rebels are expected to sit down for a first round of formal peace talks on Sunday.
Teams from both sides will meet at 4:00 pm (1015 GMT) at a four-star hotel near to the royal palace.
The rebels and the government declared a ceasefire on January 29 and said they were willing to hold talks to end seven years of bloody insurgency.
The first round was originally planned for April 21, but the rebels pulled out at the last minute, complaining no substantive issues had been put on the agenda.
On Thursday government negotiator and Minister for Communications Ramesh Nath Pandey met with two Maoist leaders to set a new date.
""The informal talks we held with two Maoist negotiating team members K.B. Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa were very useful and created a congenial atmosphere for the official talks,"" Pandey said.
""Both His Majesty's government and the Maoist negotiators are participating in the peace dialogue fully understanding the need to protect national unity and also recognise the aspirations of the Nepalese people,"" he said.
Maoist sources said the first round of talks would include political issues.
""We are highly confident that there would be no obstacles now to start first round of peace dialogue between us and the officials,"" a highly placed Maoist source said.
""The official negotiators have agreed to start talking on all issues, including political issues, in the very first round of peace dialogue,"" the source said.
""The main thrust of the first round of peace talks will be political issue, the strict honouring of the Code of Conduct (CoC) for the talks and release of Maoist prisoners.""
The 22-point CoC, signed in March, says both sides are committed to finding a peaceful solution through dialogue, will stop violent activities including strikes and kidnappings, gradually release prisoners, not obstruct the transport of food and medicine and help displaced people return home.
The Maoist ""people's war"" for a communist republic has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
A previous attempt at peace talks in 2001 stalled after three rounds over the Maoist demand for the abolition of the monarchy.
But observers said the chances for peace seemed better this time around as the Maoists have toned down their rhetoric and said they are prepared to negotiate with the king.
""We want Nepal's king to be a patriotic and popular monarch working for the country and the people, like the Cambodian Monarch Prince Shihanouk,"" Maoist leader and negotiator Babu Ram Bhattarai said in an interview with AFP Friday.
Bhattarai came out of seven years of hiding last month, indicating that the Maoists were serious about the talks.
But the peace process has been complicated by the political situation in the Himalayan kingdom.
On October 4, King Gyanendra dismissed the elected prime minister, citing incompetence, and appointed a royalist interim government.
The Maoists and political parties say the government does not have a mandate to negotiate with the rebels.

"3164",20045310,"Title: News Analysis_ SAARC moves to strengthen cooperation in economic, social fields by Rong Shoujun.rtf; Date: January 3, 2004, Saturday; Text: by Rong Shoujun
ISLAMABAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian leaders who will meet Sunday in Islamabad are eager to strengthen their cooperation in the economic and social fields and to promote stability, prosperity and progress in the region through joint actions.
The 12th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which was originally scheduled for early 2003 only becomes possible after India and Pakistan, two largest members of the regional grouping, eased their high tensions in the past year.
The two arch rivals resumed their ambassadorial ties and restored their land as well as air links snapped two years ago after the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament,  creating favorable atmosphere for the summit.
What's more, the troops from both sides began to observe effectively a ceasefire in Kashmir, the first in the past 14 years since an Islamic military struggle against Indian rule started.
Hopes have been raised that the SAARC leaders will make this summit fruitful and make some notable achievements. The 12th summit will open a totally new chapter in the history of the 18- year old body which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Currently focused mainly on the socio-economic issues, SAARC seeks to enlarge economic opportunities and welfare of the peoples of the region to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development. It has put wide-range economic cooperation and poverty elimination high on its agenda.
During a two-day preparatory meeting prior to the summit, the foreign ministers of the member states agreed on three key pacts to be signed at the summit. The agreements on free trade, terrorism and a social charter will top the agenda of the 12th summit.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri told reporters Friday that he is optimistic about the signing of the draft South Asian Free Trade Agreement, which business leaders are hoping will transform the home of half the world's poor into a powerful trade bloc.
The 10th summit held in Colombo in 1998 decided that member states to take measures to remove structural impediments in order to move speedily towards the goal of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). If an agreement on free trade area is signed and implemented, it will give the much-needed fillip to economic cooperation in South Asia, where the intra-regional trade is a paltry 3.4 percent as compared to the Association of the South Eastern Nations' 38.4 percent, 37.3 percent for North American Free Trade Area and 63.4 percent for the European Union.
A SAARC Social Charter is also to be signed by leaders of the member states at the summit. It sets minimum standards for social development in the region and puts in place a mechanism of cooperating on vital social issues that have not been given due attention over the years. Officials here termed the charter as significant milestone in the association's history, saying it would give member states a roadmap for social development.
The 10th SAARC summit in Colombo in 1998 directed that a Social Charter be developed for SAARC, elevating the status of national plans of action to a regional dimension with a specific role for the grouping. It was determined that the charter would focus on setting broad-range targets to be achieved across the region.
At the meeting of SAARC foreign ministers, an agreement was also reached on an ""additional protocol"" to an existing anti- terrorism agreement, referring to an extra clause on choking terrorist funding. It is designed to update the members' obligations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The SAARC leaders signed the Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism in Kathmandu in November 1987 during their 3rd Summit, which came into force on August 22, 1988 following ratification by all member states. The convention provides a regional focus to many of the well- established principles of international law in this respect. Under its provisions, member states are committed to extraditing or prosecuting alleged terrorists thus preventing them from enjoying safe havens.
Regional cooperation is also envisaged in preventive action to combat terrorism through exchange of information, intelligence and expertise identified for mutual cooperation under the convention.
In the context of rapid economic integration in other regions, the SAARC members hope to speed up their pace in setting up a free trade area and improve the social development. But it is widely believed that unless India and Pakistan, the two key players, further improve their ties and some bilateral political issues are addressed, as Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan put it, SAARC can not meet the expectations of its founders.

    The commission has also cleared six former cabinet ministers  who were accused of accepting and distributing funds on the same  case.
    The investigation team of the commission had charged the former government officials including Deuba for distributing about 4  million Nepali rupees (57,142 US dollars) unlawfully at the  commission about two months ago.
    The all-powerful anti-graft panel has also given clean chit to  the 27 ""beneficiaries"" of the alleged misappropriation of the fund.
    A three-member ""bench"" consisting of the commission's chairman  Bhakta Bahadur Koirala and two of its members Shambhu Khanal and  Hari Babu Chaudhari announced the ""verdict"" to that effect on  Monday afternoon.
    Earlier, the RCCC investigation team in its charge sheet  demanded a jail term of up to three years against Deuba and all  the six ministers and a penalty sum equaling the ""misappropriated"" amount. 
    While the six former ministers had furnished bail as demanded  by the RCCC and were immediately released, Deuba had refused to do so challenging the constitutionality of the commission.
    ""Though the decision, to distribute the allowances, was against the norms and modus operandi of the government, they cannot be  convicted as per the Section 17 of the Nepal Corruption Control  Act 1993,"" the commission said in its decision.
    However, Deuba is still in custody on charges of another  alleged corruption case involving the multi-million-US-dollar  Melamchi Drinking Water Project.

 NHRC had already asked the government and the security bodies to stop the arrests and disappearing of civilians. If that did not stop, the commission had warned that it would internationalize the issue.
 ""Despite repeated alerts, the government and the security agencies did not listen. Therefore, the commission was compelled to inform the United Nations regarding this issue,"" NHRC source said.
 When the UN high commissioner on human rights arrives, it is possible that he may be taken on a tour of the areas where security forces have been mobilized and Maoist bases. Various meetings and interactions will also be held during that time.
 NHRC has repeatedly invited the army chief Pyar Jung Thapa to discuss the human rights violations. But he has been defying the invitation.

""The unwise decision of the pilots to fly the helicopter, despite the adverse weather, resulted in the crash,"" said Keshari Raj Pundit.
The Russian-made helicopter disappeared on September 23 shortly after taking off from Ghunsa, a high-altitude, remote mountainous zone covered with thick forest around 500 kilometres (300 miles) east of the capital Kathmandu.
""The unfamiliar terrain, high altitude, poor crew coordination and a lack of area map information contributed to cause the incident,"" Pundit said.
The report was handed to Nepal's Minister for Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation Pradeep Gyawali on Monday, he said.
On board the helicopter were Forest Minister Gopal Rai, the Finnish embassy's charge d'affaires Pauli Mustonen, senior World Wildlife Fund officials from Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, as well as Margaret Alexander, the deputy director in Nepal of the US government's international aid arm, USAID.
Four of Nepal's most respected conservationists were also on the helicopter, which was crewed by two Russians and two Nepalis.

""Christian Kuntner, 44, was killed while Abele Blanc, 52, was badly injured as the avalanche hit a 10-member Italian climbing team at 6:30 am (0100 GMT) Wednesday morning,"" the official said.
Blanc remained in serious condition at a Kathmandu hospital Thursday, said his physician, Binod Singh.
""Seems he has rib fractures but his team members want him to be discharged from the hospital soon,"" Singh said.
The other two injured climbers were identified as Stephan Anders, 37, and Marco B.
""The climbers were at a height of 6,600 meters (21,780 feet) when the avalanche struck them,"" said Dambar Parajuli, manager of Thamserku Trekking, which handled the expedition to the 8,091-meter (26,544-foot) peak.
""We were on the way to the summit of Annapurna-I when the avalanche struck,"" one of the climbers, Marco Camadona, 34, told AFP.
Camadona added that five of the team members including Kuntner and Blanc had planned to reach the summit of Annapurna Wednesday afternoon.
""Had they been successful, it would have been a record for Kuntner and Blanc of having climbed all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters (26,400 feet) in height,"" Camadona said.
""The ice avalanche fell from a height of 7,000 meters (23,100 feet) as we are climbing the mountain and swept us 500 meters (1,650 feet) down the mountain,"" said Anders who had an arm in a sling.
The climbers carried Kuntner down to a camp after the avalanche, but said he died before a rescue helicopter arrived.
The incident occurred a week after US climber Edmund Viesturs scaled Annapurna to become one of only a dozen people who have conquered the world's tallest 14 peaks. Viesturs, 45, from Bainsbridge, Washington, reached the summit last Thursday.
In 1986, renowned Italian climber Reinhold Messner was the first person to complete all 14 8,000-meter-plus peaks.

Media consortium to disband vote-counting operation
 
NEW YORK (AP) - Six major news organizations announced Jan. 13 the breakup of Voter News Service, the consortium they had built to count votes and conduct surveys on Election Day. The decision follows two major election-night failures in a row by VNS.
Given the expense of mounting such operations on their own, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and The Associated Press said they were considering other options for sharing vote counts and exit poll surveys.
But it will no longer be VNS, an operation that was created in 1993.
In November 2000, flawed information from VNS twice led television networks to incorrectly declare a winner in the presidential race in Florida, the state that proved to be key to the outcome. The results there were not determined until weeks later after recounts and a court battle that was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore.
Following that embarrassment, VNS contracted with Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio-based research company, to rebuild its system. But in the 2002 election, VNS was unable to provide its members and other clients with results from exit poll surveys. This material is used to help make projections of winners and to supplement the vote count with an analysis of why people voted as they did.
""The project is very large and there was a feeling that the mission of VNS could be better accomplished by working with multiple outside companies,"" said Bill Wheatley, executive vice president of NBC News.
VNS was headed by former CBS News executive Ted Savaglio and has had about 30 permanent employees. Savaglio could not immediately be reached for comment.
The dissolution of VNS means that the system Battelle was building will not be completed, according to a network executive who spok"

    Violent demonstrations erupted last Wednesday in Kathmandu  after 12 Nepalese workers were killed by a militant group in Iraq.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 3 September
Kathmandu, 2 September: The chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Prachanda, has warned that the parties'-Maoist talks could become derailed if management of the Maoist arms alone is made the main issue.
Prachanda issued the warning while speaking at a function at Sanogaucharan in Kathmandu on Saturday [2 September]. ""If the issue of Maoist arms management is raised persistently, instead of a consensus on political issues being forged, it could derail the talks between the seven parties and the Maoists. And if the talks derail, we will send the reactionaries to the jungle. Maoists will not get into government by laying down arms."" [passage omitted: This was the first time since March 1996 that Prachanda had given speech at a public function]
""If the talks derail this time, not us but the king and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will go to the jungle,"" Prachanda said. He also urged the prime minister not to fall into the US trap.
He said the statement by a US official [name not mentioned] was against peace and stability. He also accused the seven parties of working against the spirit of the people's movement.
Expressing the commitment that he would fulfil the people's desire for peace at any cost, Prachanda said: ""The donation drive is just. The lands and properties of the feudals will not be returned under any circumstances. The Maoists came to Kathmandu for peace talks to take the country towards republicanism.""
Another speaker at the function, Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai, said wheeling and dealing over arms was under way in the midst of the peace talks drama and that the Narayanhiti [royal palace], Singha Durbar [central secretariat], Baluwatar [prime minister's residence] and embassies in Kathmandu were actively involved.
Dr Bhattarai called for an immediate announcement of an interim constitution, interim government and dates for constituent assembly elections.

The Federation of Nepalese Journalists, an umbrella body of media rights groups, said two journalists were killed by the Maoist rebels while three were killed by the government side since fighting that has followed the collapse of peace talks in August.
An additional 68 journalists were detained during the same period for questioning, some of them held for months while 31 were reported to have been abused or even tortured by the authorities.
""The freedom and rights of press and journalists has been curtailed in Nepal,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri, general secretary of the Federation. ""We are being targeted and harassed by both sides of the conflict.""
Journalists in Nepal have faced increasing threats from both government troops and rebels since fighting resumed.
The rebels have targeted journalists for writing articles critical of the insurgency and driven them out of their homes. At least six journalists have been reported missing without a trace in the past seven months, among 12 who disappeared in the past two years.
The three journalists killed by government troops were believed to have close links with the rebels and had written articles in pro-rebel publications.
International media rights groups like Paris-based Reporters Without Borders and New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists have been repeatedly asking the Nepal government to stop harassing journalists.
The group has cited arrests, murders and kidnappings of journalists in this Himalayan kingdom.
At one point Nepal was named the biggest jail for journalists.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.
More than 9,500 people have been killed since the insurgency began.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the truce fell apart, and hundreds of rebels have been reportedly killed.
Police detained nearly 200 journalists over the weekend in Katmandu while covering protests against the king. Some of them were also injured in the scuffle with the police.
Nisthuri said they are now demanding the resignation of the information minister.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 7 February
The President of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists Bishnu Nishthuri has challenged the government to make public the names of media houses being run by remote control. Addressing a programme organized by the federation in the capital today, Nishthuri said the Nepalese press was ready to face any challenge confronting the media and he accused the government of making base allegations against the media to cover up its shortcomings. He said instead of making accusation and curbing the freedom of the press, the government should be focused on restoring democracy and people's rights.
Likewise, speaking at the programme, the General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists Mahendra Bista said advocating for democracy and freedom of expression does not mean that the media is being operated by remote control. He said the press was not being operated by remote control, but was driven by the control of the people.
Yesterday, the Minister for Information and Communication Shiris Shamsher Rana and the Home Minister Kamal Thapa had accused the media of being operated by remote control.
During the programme the Federation of Nepalese Journalists informed the media about its on the stop visit to the Far Western region of the country to monitor the press there. The federation said that due to understanding between various parties concerned, the situation had improved for journalists. However, the federation said that journalists continued to be harassed by officials nominated by the government.

District police filed the case Monday at a court in Patan on Kathmandu's outskirts, charging that the 21 Maoists masterminded the killing of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, the highest-level official assassinated since the insurgency began in 1996.
The police asked for life imprisonment for 18 senior Maoists including the rebels' top leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- known by the alias Prachanda (The Fierce) -- and Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoist negotiator in failed peace talks this year.
Under Nepalese law, a life term requires at least 20 years in prison. The kingdom does not have the death penalty.
Police called for 10 years in prison each for three lesser-ranking Maoists, Krishna Hari Sainju, Seeta Karanjit and Kamal Bista.
Shrestha, his wife Regmi and his bodyguard Surya Regmi were gunned down January 26 as they went on a morning walk in Lalitpur on Kathmandu's outskirts. The Maoists claimed responsibility for the killings.
The assassination sent shockwaves through Nepal's political circles and three days later the government reached a ceasefire with the Maoists.
But three rounds of peace talks failed to yield a breakthrough and the rebels ended the ceasefire on August 27 after the government refused to convene a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
Prachanda rarely makes public appearances and Bhattarai, who moved openly in Kathmandu during the truce, went back underground before the Maoists withdrew from the peace process.
Since the breakdown of the truce, the government has declared the Maoists a terrorist organization, which would allow security forces to arrest rebel leaders. The terrorist label was lifted as a goodwill gesture during the ceasefire.
Other prominent Maoists charged over Shrestha's killing include Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa.
The Armed Police Force was created under Shrestha's leadership to combat the Maoists after the rebels broke an earlier truce in November 2001 with a flurry of attacks on often ill-prepared local police.
The Maoists' seven-year insurgency aimed at overthrowing the monarchy has claimed more than 7,900 lives, according to government figures. Officials have reported 138 deaths since the breakdown of the latest truce.

The villagers were kidnapped Saturday from Richauli, Chapali, Bhajkakani and Mahadevsthan villages in Doti district, a known rebel stronghold about 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of the capital, Katmandu, where access for troops is difficult.
The army statement did not say how many villagers were taken or their condition.
The rebels are known to haul away villagers for several days to attend rallies and indoctrination sessions in remote areas of the mountain kingdom. Victims of such kidnappings are usually released after spending a few days being lectured about the rebels' struggle to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
The Maoist rebels did not immediately respond to the army's statement.
The rebels had announced the cease-fire on Sept. 3, but said they would defend their positions and not attack any government officials or civilians.
Rebel violence in Nepal has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government in February.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996. The insurgency has left some 12,000 people dead.

He has asked the government either to provide him with medical treatment immediately or free him.
Nepal is suffering from a respiratory disease. When arrested at his home, he was taking medicines under doctor's supervision. Pathak said no medical team has reached the detention centre, even two days after Nepal's detention.

No progress had been made in trying to contain a rebellion by Maoists that has claimed around 10,000 lives since 1996, they added.
""Two years of King Gyanendra's direct rule ... have been completed today but we do not see any signs of visible reform in the economy nor achievements in the Nepalese political scenario,"" said political analyst Lok Raj Baral.
""The king on October 4, 2002 dissolved the elected parliament, sacked the prime minister and assumed the people's sovereign and executive rights (while) promising to control corruption, maintain law and order and hold general elections,"" he said.
""We have not seen any progress on the economic and political fronts nor any control of the Maoist rebellion in the past two years ... There is no change at all in the national socio-economic and political scenario,"" said Baral, former ambassador to India and a champion of democracy.
""The king has failed to steer the country in the right direction nor has he been able to justify his October actions.""
Political science professor Kapil Shrestha, a member of the National Human Rights Commission, said the king's move had proved counter-productive.
""We do not want to remember the night of October 4, 2002 when King Gyanendra, like his late father Mahendra, acted against the constitution and the elected government,"" Shrestha said.
Mahendra in 1960 dissolved the parliament and dismissed the elected premier, Bisweswore Prasad Koirala.
""The king's step has been counter-productive and damaged the credibility and the legitimacy of the kingship itself,"" Shrestha said.
""Plans to hold elections are meaningless at a time when 80 percent of the rural regions are controlled by the rebels,"" he said.
The king has said he wants elections held before next April. But opposition parties call this a stalling tactic as it would be impossible to stage a vote until Gyanendra's appointed government engages the Maoists in a peace process.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, reappointed by the king 18 months after his October 4, 2002 dismissal, says he wants elections early next year.
But the rebels have already made it clear they will not allow polls to be held unless their demand is met for a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The Maoists' demand for a constituent assembly, which ultimately aims at seeing the world's only Hindu kingdom being declared a secular republic, has scuttled two previous peace attempts.
Bhubaneswore Daibagya, a former member of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, told AFP the king's use of Article 127 of the constitution had been illegal.
""The king does not have the right to use Article 127,"" he said. ""If the process continues, this country does not have any future.""
Article 127 grants the king powers to issue orders should ""difficulties"" arise in governance of the country, but stipulates that the orders ""shall be placed in the parliament"".
""The country is badly engulfed in the Maoist problem ... and unless the king can solve the problem right from the grassroots level, the insurgency cannot be solved,"" Daibagya said.
Nepal's main four political parties Monday staged a series of protests in Kathmandu to demand that the king restore democratic rule.
The parties brought tens of thousands onto the streets during daily anti-monarchy protests in April and May.

Word of the killings came on Monday just hours after government ministers Kamal Thapa and Prakash Chandra Lohani flew to the rebel stronghold of Hapure, nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Katmandu, and met with guerrilla leaders for 90 minutes.
The two ministers arrived eight hours late for the talks because monsoon rain delayed their flight. On Tuesday, both sides were scheduled to discuss a rebel demand for a new constitution, Thapa told reporters.
""The rebels have agreed to begin discussions on the main agenda from Tuesday,"" Thapa told reporters after returning to Nepalgunj, where the talks began on Sunday.
Thapa also said the government handed over a list of 233 people allegedly abducted by the rebels in the past few months and asked for their release or their whereabouts.
On Sunday, the guerrillas rejected a government proposal for an interim administration that would include rebels, and other reforms.
The rebels called the proposal disappointing, saying it failed to address many national issues.
They demand a special elected assembly that would draft a new constitution. They also want the assembly to decide if the king should continue as a constitutional monarch - or if the country should be turned into a communist state.
The government said it would not compromise or negotiate on the issue of Nepal's multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy, but was ready to make changes on everything else.
Despite the differences, Thapa said the government was optimistic that a solution would be found.
The rebels, who say they're inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a socialist state. The insurgency has killed around 7,000 people.
They declared a cease-fire in January and agreed to peace talks after the government stopped calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on their leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
The current round of talks is the third so far.

"3693",20054150,"Title: Family appeals for help from locals in finding missing American trekker.rtf; Date: August 3, 2005 Wednesday; Text: The father of an American trekker, missing for nearly two weeks in the Himalayan foothills, on Wednesday appealed for help from local people in finding his 25-year-old son.
Trevor Stokol, 25, of Plano, Texas, had been trekking around Mount Everest when he was reported missing last month.
""We appeal to the local people in the area to keep an eye out for him. We truly believe Trevor is out there … possibly lost,"" Arnold Stokol, the missing trekker's father, told reporters in Katmandu.
""There is a chance he could be disoriented and wandering around the villages,"" the senior Stokol said.
He said rescuers would carry out another search by helicopter around Everest base camp on Thursday.
Arnold Stokol arrived in Nepal last week to lead a search for his son. On Tuesday, the missing trekker's mother and sister arrived and were expected to join in the search operation.
Trevor was last seen heading out to take photographs on July 22, carrying his camera gear, a bottle of water and some candy bars. He never returned to the village where his traveling companion was waiting for him.
He was on the last leg of an eight-month backpacking trip through Asia.
Two days after he was reported missing, rescuers on foot and in helicopters scoured the mountain terrain near Mount Everest but have found no clue to his whereabouts.
Helicopters have searched the area from Lukla, the closest airport to Mount Everest at 2,800 meters (9,200 feet), all the way up to the base camp at 5,300 meters (17,400 feet).
The route between Lukla and base camp is popular with Western trekkers. It takes about two weeks or less.
There are not many people trekking at this time of year because of frequent and heavy monsoon rain.
The family has set up a fund back in the United States to help with the search.
Arnold Stokol said it was very unlikely that his son had been abducted by communist rebels who are spread across this Himalayan nation.
""That thought came to my mind but it is extremely unlikely,"" he said.

 The hostage-taking in North Ossetia school topped the bulletins of Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya and Al-Alam throughout the day. Other stories that featured regularly include the first meeting of the newly appointed Iraqi National Assembly, foreign hostages in Iraq and demonstrations in Kathmandu, Nepal, against the killing of nationals in Iraq. The three channels also covered, albeit with less focus, the story of Iraqi politician Al-Chalabi escaping attempt on his life, the arrest of a high-ranking member of Al-Qa'idah in Pakistan, Taleban attack of US base in southern Afghanistan, the killing of Iraqi in Musol attack and the US Republican convention held in New York.
:as listed
The long coverage of the events in North Ossetia by the three channels was factual and neutral in tone. They all showed almost similar footage from the scene. They also went over yesterday's Moscow attack, and recalled the crash of the two Russian passenger planes, highlighting the possibility of Chechenyan involvement. The three channels carried lengthy live relays by their correspondents and interviewed analysts. Al-Jazeera spoke to a Russian fluent Arabic speaking analyst from Moscow and to a Chechnyan academic from Jordan. They both stressed the Chechnyan presidential elections as possible motivation for the attacks.
 The issue of hostages in Iraq also featured consistently throughout. Al-Arabiya, in particular, devoted ample air time to it and opened a number of its bulletins with related latest developments. It also broke the story of the release of seven hostages by the Black Flags groups and covered it live, as well as the release of a Turkish hostage and the kidnapping of a Jordanian in Iraq. But of all three, Al-Alam was the only one to show part of the video of the gruesome execution of the 12 Nepalese. As for Al-Jazeera, it carried a lengthy interview with French Foreign Minister Barnier. It is worth noting that the interviewer's questions sounded like prompters to the minister to stress the pro-Arab French foreign policy and appeal for the release of the two French journalists.
 The coverage of the first meeting of the Iraqi National Assembly was factual and neutral by the three channels. However, Al-Arabiya carried live the news conference of the newly elected speaker, while the Iraqi station Al-Iraqiyah showed live part of the morning's proceedings.
 Coverage of follow-up to yesterday's attacks in Beersheba featured on Al-Alam and Al-Arabiya. Speaking on Israeli reaction, Al-Alam's reporter said: ""The Jewish state vowed to continue the building of the racist separation wall"". Both channels showed a demonstration by Hamas in Gaza, celebrating the two attacks.
 Some channels had exclusive coverage of some stories, such as:
 Fire in oil pipeline in northern Iraq by Al-Alam
 Hikmatyar's call for the boycott of Afghan presidential elections, and north Korean seeking political asylum in a Japanese school in Beijing, by Al-Jazeera
 Rally in Lebanon marking anniversary of disappearance of Shi'a leader Musa al-Sadr, by Al-Arabiya. Clip of Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri attacking ""the Libyan criminal regime"" was shown repeatedly.
 In its 1600 gmt main bulletin, Al-Iraqiyah focused mainly on domestic issues: The opening session of the Iraqi National Assembly; Allawi condemning the attack on Al-Chalabi; youth centre; computer training in Basra; water treatment station.

 Jungathapachaur (Jajarkot) mid-west Nepal , 21 January: Rebel CPN (Maoist) have declared eight districts of mid-west Nepal Bheri-Karnali an autonomous region. They declared the region ""under a strategy to capture power at the centre.""
 Addressing a meeting at the remote village of Jungathapachaur in Jajarkot Monday 19 Jan , politburo member Krishna Bahadur Mahara said: ""We have reached a stage to capture power at the centre."" He was addressing a mass meeting announcing the launch of the provincial government.

Mahara added: ""We will unify all our forces and concentrate our efforts to capture power at the centre. He said the ""old state"" that is about to collapse and the party will concentrate its entire attention to topple it; he claimed an atmosphere has been created for it.
 He said a provincial government was formed to establish a ""new state power"" in an organized manner; Mahara said the formation of the Bheri-Karnali Autonomous Region a milestone.
 Mahara said nine to 10 provincial governments will be formed ahead of capturing power at the centre. Magarat Autonomous People's Government was announced 9 January.
 Party Spokesman Mahara dismissed Royal Nepal Army claims Maoist military strength had diminished and military strategy had been changed to capture power at the centre. ""We have not weakened. Only our strategy has changed,"" he said."" We will demonstrate our strength by creating a storm."" He said the revolution had reached a counterattack phase.
 He said political and military strategies were being pursued simultaneously to capture power. ""Unity of the people is limited to rights. Rights given to them is determined by national unity,"" he said.
 He argued national unity can be assured only by empowering all regions, classes and backward nationalities.

"7048",20083356,"Title: Nepal editorials hail UK Gurkha rights ruling.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: October 2, 2008 Thursday
Excerpts from English-language editorials on the British High Court's Gurkha rights ruling, carried by press websites on 2 October: 
1. From the Kathmandu Post, carried by eKantipur website, headlined ""A different battle""
The Gurkhas have finally won a two-year-long legal battle against British immigration rules that denied former soldiers retired before 1997 the right to settle in the UK. Judge Justice Blake of London's High Court delivered the verdict in favour of the Gurkhas, ordering the Home Office to revise its instructions to the Immigration Office immediately. [passage omitted]
However, amending the immigration rules to let former Gurkha soldiers settle in Britain alone will not right a two-century-old wrong. Following a similar lengthy court case in the past, the British government had agreed to provide the Gurkhas pensions on a par with British soldiers. But this reform, which was a major change in British pension policy, did not apply to Gurkhas discharged before 1997 when their base was moved from Hong Kong to the UK after Great Britain handed over the territory to China.
Great Britain, which is proud of its justice system, still harbours racial discrimination with regard to its pension plan. For example, a Gurkha who retired in 2007 for medical reasons with 17 years' of service would receive (pounds) 4,650 a year, while a British soldier in similar circumstances would be paid about (pounds) 6,400. The pension scheme for Gurkhas is unjust and unfair because Gurkhas who signed up before 1997 receive between 24 and 36 per cent of what a British soldier takes home.
We are happy that a beginning has been made in rectifying an historical injustice with the two court verdicts - first, the revision of the immigration rules to let former Gurkhas retired before 1997 to settle in the UK; and, second, the decision on pay and pension parity between Gurkhas recruited after 1997 and British soldiers.
Gurkhas who fought and sacrificed their lives for Great Britain are still not treated on the same level as soldiers from the Commonwealth. These soldiers from countries which in the past belonged to the British Empire become naturalized British citizens after serving four years in the British army and enjoy rights equal to British citizens by birth. The court ruling in favour of the Gurkhas is a victory over a great wrong, as British actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the British Gurkhas, has said.
2. From The Himalayan Times, carried by the paper's own site, headlined ""Debt of honour"":
The struggle the British Gurkhas have been running for the past several years for equality of treatment with their British counterparts has paid dividends. As part of its effort to address their demands, the British government has significantly increased their pension. Their pension had been very low indeed. The London High Court's decision two days ago (Sept 30) that recognized the right of former Gurkha soldiers who retired before 1997 to settle in Britain today marks a high point in the Gurkhas' pursuit of justice. [passage omitted]
The verdict is based on common sense and fairness principle. On the one hand, it respects the huge contributions of Gurkha veterans to the security of Britain and its possessions for many decades, and on the other hand it removes the awkwardness of the existing legal provision, which should now give the British government itself a sense of relief. This is also because all other foreign soldiers in the British army have a right to settle in Britain after serving it for four years anywhere in the world. 
The Gurkha component has strengthened Nepal-Britain relationship, whatever the circumstances under which the practice started. No doubt, the Gurkha recruitment has given thousands of Nepalis jobs. This does not, however, take away from the merit inherent in the view that it is better for the Nepali youths to serve Nepal instead of foreign armies. But, for that to happen, proper conditions need to be created first.
Undoubtedly, the Gurkha soldiers, known worldwide for their courage, bravery and loyalty, have always given more to host governments than they have taken from them. So, the return on investment for the hosts has been quite attractive. Around 200,000 Gurkhas fought for Britain in the two World Wars, and some 3,500 now serve in the British army, including in troubled spots Iraq and Afghanistan. They have given their blood, sweat and tears for the sake of host nations. For Britain alone, more than 45,000 Gurkha soldiers have laid down their lives. 
Reputed to be among the most ferocious of fighters in the world, the Gurkhas are often sent to serve in the most difficult of wars and terrain, and they have never belied the trust reposed in them. The ""moral debt of honour"" and gratitude that Britain has to the Gurkhas for their long military service, to quote Judge Nicholas Blake's words, are apt expressions of tribute to the warriors from Nepal.

"210",20031926,"Title: Widow of McDonald's Founder Dies at 75_1.rtf; Date: October 12, 2003 Sunday; Text: Joan B. Kroc, the billionaire widow of McDonald's Corp. founder Ray Kroc who became known for her philanthropic donations to groups promoting world peace, died Sunday of brain cancer. She was 75.
Kroc died at her home in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe, several months after being diagnosed with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, said Dick Starmann, her spokesman.
With an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion, Kroc ranked No. 121 on Forbes magazine's latest list of the nation's wealthiest people.
She inherited the San Diego Padres after her husband died in 1984 and played an active role in running the team until she sold it in 1990 to a group led by Los Angeles television producer Tom Werner.
Her donations created Notre Dame's Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies in 1986 and the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice in 2001. She was also a major benefactor of the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta.
Kroc contributed $12 million to establish the Notre Dame center after hearing the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, then president of the university, warn about the arms race at a San Diego talk in 1985, said Scott Appleby, the center's director.
""She walked up to him after the talk and said, 'I'm going to help you,""' said Appleby. ""She was a passionate champion of peace and justice and she was single-minded in her dedication to eliminating the threat of nuclear weapons and all forms of deadly violence.""
The University of San Diego think tank has worked to broker peace in hot spots including Nepal, Madagascar and the Ivory Coast, said Joyce Neu, executive director, who pegged Kroc's donations to the center at more than $30 million.
Kroc also contributed more than $90 million to the Salvation Army for a 12.5-acre arts and recreation center in east San Diego, said Maj. Cindy Foley, the center's administrator.
""She worried that there were children and families who didn't have an opportunity to discover their talents because of a lack of facilities,"" Maj. Foley said. ""She embodied the word generosity.""
Born Aug. 27, 1928 in St. Paul, Minn., Kroc was a musician and music teacher for many years. She married Ray Kroc in 1969 and the couple moved from Chicago to San Diego in 1976, two years after purchasing the Padres and preventing the team's planned move to Washington, D.C.
When Ray Kroc died in 1984 at age 81, his wife succeeded him as the Padres' owner and chairwoman. She admitted knowing nothing about baseball when she took the helm, but that did not stop her from speaking out. The Padres went to the World Series in her first season, losing to the Detroit Tigers.
Kroc was deeply involved in running the team, at one point rehiring Manager Dick Williams after he was fired without her consultation. She sold the team in 1990, not because of the team's poor performance, she said, but because she wanted to spend more time with her family.
""I'm a few years older now, and, unlike Zsa Zsa (Gabor), I'm not ashamed to admit that I'll be 62 next August,"" she said in a 1989 interview. ""I think it's time to prioritize.""
Kroc is survived by a daughter, four granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.

    The separatists thronged the visa office of the Chinese Embassy  in Nepal, shouting out anti-China slogans. 
    Local police soon moved in to break up the rally and detained  around 50 of the demonstrators, who were blocking both the city  traffic and the normal operation of the Chinese diplomatic  mission. 
    The Nepali government has repeatedly said that Tibet is an  inalienable part of China and that it will not allow anti-China  activities on its territory. 
    Tibetan separatists have staged anti-China protests since  mid-March in Kathmandu. The activities often went ugly, leading to  disruptions of city traffic and clashes with police. 
    Chinese Ambassador Zheng Xianglin said last month that there  were criminal acts of beating and smashing in Kathmandu against  other Tibetans who either refused to take part in anti-China  activities or held different positions from the separatists.

 Five political parties and their student wings called the dawn-to-dusk strike to protest against police intervention during their antimonarchy protests.
Security was tight in the cities and their environs where business and educational institutions were closed, and vehicular traffic stayed mostly off the streets.
 Government offices were open although attendance was reported to be thin Monday, which is the first working day of the week.
 In a pre-strike move Sunday, students and political activists carried out torch-lit rallies at several places.
 Political leaders said the government had forced them to call the closure by perpetrating an 'extreme form of atrocities' during peaceful protests.
 The leaders have also complained of police 'atrocity' against student leaders who are organizing public hearings on the relevance of the monarchy to Nepal.
 Nepal's mainstream political parties are fighting against what they call King Gyanendra's 'regressive step' Oct. 4, 2002, when he dismissed the elected prime minister and seized executive power for himself.
 The monarch has since failed to put the political process back on a democratic track, political party leaders say.

 It is unfortunate to see that the pro-parliament political parties have not been able to understand the reality - Maoists for the past nine years have been rebelling to establish a communist republic in place of the constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy - and adopt a common opinion to solve the problem.
 Due to the violent rebellion, the indifference and stagnation of the political parties, Nepal is on the brink of becoming a failed state, but the political parties are still busy with their own agendas and are unconcerned about national consensus, which is increasing the possibility for the situation to deteriorate further. The violent rebellion that had been limiting the presence of the government to the district headquarters has now finally entrapped the capital as well. This is a big challenge for the government; this is a clear sign that the country's capital has been surrounded by the rebels.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 20 Aug 04
The situation has deteriorated to such a degree that it is hard to believe in the government's presence and effectiveness even inside the capital. The multinational industrial enterprises that could not remain assured by the government's security assurances have closed down their businesses.  passage omitted: capital is under blockade, industries located in the strongholds of the security forces have been closed down; blockade has its roots in the minds of irresponsible political leaders
 Big parties like the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist) should initiate a process for national consensus to solve the problem. These two parties should call all small and big parties to a round-table conference and forge a national consensus. There is no possibility that the palace will disagree with the decision of the political parties. Whatever policy is adopted after reaching such consensus, a positive and lasting solution to the Maoist problem should be sought on the basis of the policy. No solution is expected from an individual party, group or their statements. If the pro-parliament political parties remain divided, continue to suspect each other and try to address the Maoist problem in an individualistic manner, then sooner or later they are certain to be ruined. So the pro-parliament forces need to hurry to unite against the anti-democratic forces.

    KATHMANDU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- It is not wise for some  international institutions in Nepal to publicly interfere in other  countries' internal affairs and attempt to undermine the relations  between Nepal and China, said a press release from the Chinese  embassy in Nepal. 
    ""An embassy in Nepal and one or two so-called human rights  organizations have been pointing fingers at the measures adopted  by the Government of Nepal, in accordance with the law, to deal  with anti-China separatist activities launched by some Tibetans in  Nepal,"" the press release quoted a Chinese embassy spokesperson as  saying.

    ""In fact, a few 'Tibetan Independende' organizations and their  ringleaders, by organizing and instigating the Tibetans who do not  know the truth, attempted to storm the Chinese embassy many times,  damaged the embassy's buildings twice, and repeatedly attacked the  patriotic Tibetans, destroying their houses and shops and  threatening their safety,"" it said. 
    ""The Government of Nepal emphasizes Nepal-China neighborly  friendliness, adheres to the one-China policy, and does not allow  any anti-China separatist activity to take place in Nepal,"" it  said.

    The value and volume of the exports declined 22 and 28 percent, respectively, in 2005, according to the report from the United  Nations Development Program (UNDP).
    Losses in the United States (U.S.) market were more severe than in the European Union (EU) market, Nepal's other big textile and  clothing customer.
    Among knitted ready-made garments from Nepal, the value of US  imports plunged more than half - some 55 percent - with woven  garments losing 30 percent of the market. 
    Together, the two markets represent the destinations of nearly  all of Nepal's textile and clothing exports.
    Increasing price competition, closures of factories, job losses and deterioration of workers' conditions have been reported in  countries like Nepal that lost export orders as well as in  countries that managed to keep their export volume.
    The report called on Nepal ""to diversify its exportable  products as well as markets."" 
    Carpets represent the top Nepali export commodity in both the U. S. and the EU. But three out of Nepal's top five commodities are  those that face more competition after the elimination of quotas  and also are produced by other countries in the region.
    ""With this kind of competition, a small country like Nepal is  pushed out of competition at the initial stage,"" the report stated.

 The common platform could be forged on a minimum understanding of the rebels' program of abolishing the monarchy in Nepal, Baburam Bhattarai said in his article in the Nepal Samacharpatra.
 The need for a common platform for a 'progressive political solution' -- the Maoist euphemism for ending the antimonarchist insurgency -- is felt today more than ever, Bhattarai said.
The senior member of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) said recent talks between rebel leaders and the general secretary of the Nepal Communist Party (Unified Marxist-Leninist, NCP-UML) in Lucknow, India, were aimed at such understanding.
 Bhattarai, the party's No. 2 man after Puspakamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, and the party's principal ideologue, said understanding of, and cooperation with, the centrist Nepali Congress Party (NCP) is becoming increasingly crucial.
 The NCP is Nepal's largest political party, while the NCP-UML is the mainline left outfit. The two parties held the largest and second largest number of seats, respectively, in Nepal's dissolved parliament.
 Both are presently fighting what they term the regressive step of King Gyanaendra, who dismissed the elected government and seized executive powers in October 2002.
 On the rebels' demand for a common front, both parties hold the position that they would be more than willing to join forces if the rebels lay down their arms and eschew violence.
 The NCP and NCP-UML together drafted Nepal's Constitution of 1990, which provides for constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
 The Maoists, however, reject the Constitution, saying it does not adequately curtail the king's powers.
 The rebels are demanding elections to a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution that will decide the future of the monarchy in Nepal.
 The rebels pressed their demand for the assembly during the peace talks that failed last August.

"6767",20081342,"Title: Everest conqueror Hillary dies aged 88_1.rtf; Date: January 11, 2008 Friday 12:48 AM GMT; Text: Edmund Hillary, who climbed to international fame as the first person to conquer Everest, the world's highest mountain, died Friday aged 88.
The plain-speaking former New Zealand beekeeper became a household name after he and Nepalese guide Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Everest on May 29, 1953, standing atop a peak that had defied mountaineers for decades.
""Well, we knocked the bastard off,"" he said on the way back down.
News of the British led expedition's historic achievement was announced in London the day young Elizabeth II was crowned queen, only adding to the patriotic fervour of Coronation Day.
Hillary was always modest about his achievements and fame.
""I have moderate abilities but I combine these with a good deal of determination and I rather like to succeed,"" he said.
Hillary was born in Auckland on July 20, 1919, and as a youth showed no hint of the strength and skill that would make him one of the most famous mountaineers and explorers in the world.
On seeing a scrawny Hillary in his first year of high school, his physical education teacher muttered in despair: ""What will they send me next?""
""I never got over this sense of physical inferiority,"" Hillary admitted in his autobiography.
He was never meant to be the first to the top of Everest. Other team members got the first crack at the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) summit but were thwarted several hundred feet short, hampered by fatigue and low on oxygen.
After a night of little rest, Hillary and Tenzing made their second try, and the lanky New Zealander led the tricky trek up to the summit. To get around controversy, they said they had reached the top together.
It was many years before Tenzing revealed that Hillary had actually got there first. ""So there it is,"" Tenzing wrote in his book, ""the answer to the great mystery.""
""The names of Hillary and Tenzing went instantly into all languages as the names of heroes,"" Jan Morris, the British historian and journalist who accompanied the expedition, wrote in Time magazine.
""Hillary and Tenzing were two cheerful and courageous fellows doing what they liked doing,"" she said.
Hillary was the only living New Zealander ever to appear on the country's currency, a national and worldwide hero who could have made a fortune from his historic ascent.
Instead, he devoted much of his energy to his Himalayan Trust, which helped build schools, hospitals and clinics for the impoverished country of Nepal, which remained close to his heart.
Alexa Johnston, who wrote Sir Edmund Hillary - An Extraordinary Life, said Hillary was complex but his defining characteristics were incredible persistence and generosity to others.
""He's hard on himself and he can demand a lot from people but he is also not vindictive and he is able to forgive people if they don't measure up. 
""He's a driven man and he's been ambitious but he's also been incredibly ambitious for other people and particularly for the well-being of Sherpas and of course a commitment to human rights and social justice have been core to his approach to life as well.""
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said his humility and modesty represented something very important to New Zealanders.
Hillary remained a restless adventurer who re-affirmed his ambitious streak four years later in 1957, when he joined the trans-Antarctic expedition of British explorer Vivien Fuchs.
As Fuchs set off from one side of the continent, a group led by Hillary set off on tractors from the opposite side to set up supply depots and map the terrain for the second half of Fuchs' crossing.
Hillary instead stole his thunder by defying the Briton's wishes and heading to the South Pole, becoming the leader of the first expedition to reach the pole by vehicle.
In 1960, he led another Himalayan adventure, this time in search of proof of the mythical yeti or abominable snowman -- a topic of great interest since Tenzing had said his father had twice seen one.
Among the sherpa community, tales of the yeti were common but Hillary had no success. He got sick mid-way through the expedition -- possibly due to some uncertain fishcakes prepared by his friend Peter Mulgrew -- and pulled out.
In 1975, Hillary's wife and daughter were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu while flying to join him on a Himalayan Trust project.
Four years later in 1979, Mulgrew also died when a sightseeing plane crashed in Antarctica. Mulgrew's wife June travelled with Hillary to New Delhi when he was appointed New Zealand's ambassador to India in 1984 and they married five years later.
Hillary always had strong views about Everest, which has seen more than 2,000 people reach the summit after his historic success more than half a century ago.
""Having people pay 65,000 dollars and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides, I personally think, is far less attractive,"" he told the BBC in 2003. ""It isn't really mountaineering at all.""

 Likewise, people living on the banks of the Bagmati river in Teku Dobhan, Kathmandu, are also reported to be suffering from diarrhoea. The spread is attributed to the unsafe drinking water and unhygienic condition of the people living in the area.

""We have agreed to lock-up our People's Liberation Army weapons at one location. We will keep the key. The United Nations will monitor the locked-up weapons of both sides,"" rebel-leader Prachanda said on state-run Nepal Television.
The disarming of the rebels had been a sticking point in the six-month-old peace process aimed at ending a bloody conflict that has claimed at least 12,500 lives in the Himalayan nation.
Earlier Sunday, the rebel leader met with United Nations special envoy Ian Martin and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, with both sides upbeat about Monday's negotiations.
""The talks on arms management have been very positive and there may be a breakthrough Monday,"" said Sitaula, who is also the government coordinator in the peace talks team.
UN secretary general Kofi Annan appointed a special representative to Nepal after the two sides invited the world body to assist in the peace process.
Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a rebel spokesman, was also optimistic about the talks slated for Monday.
""There is a high chance that the talks could be successful,"" Mahara told AFP.
The multi-party government came to power in April after mass protests forced King Gyanendra to end direct rule and let the rebels join an interim government to end a decade-old insurgency.
Issues such as arms management and the role of the monarchy had prevented the peace process from moving ahead, and an agreement on rebel weapons could be a significant breakthrough in the peace process.

"4938",20066354,"Title: Police arrest senior opposition leader in Nepal 's capital.rtf; Date: February 22, 2006 Wednesday 6:02 AM GMT; Text: Police raided the house of a senior opposition leader who has been instrumental in organizing anti-government protests and arrested him Wednesday, just two days after he was freed by the Supreme Court, officials said.
Krishna Sitaula, spokesman for the Nepali Congress party, was picked up from his home in downtown Katmandu and detained for three months under the Public Security Act, a government notice said.
Sitaula was arrested as a preventative measure and because he was considered a threat to public safety, said an official at the district administration office that ordered the arrest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.
Sitaula has been one of the leading figures in the protests by the alliance of seven major political parties against King Gyanendra's direct rule over this Himalayan nation.
Family members at his home said police burst into his home in the morning and handed over papers saying he was under arrest. They only found out later he would be detained for three months.
""We condemn the arrest of the leader who was just freed by the Supreme Court. We demand the government immediately release him,"" said Shobhakar Parajuli, secretary of the Nepali Congress.
Sitaula had been arrested Feb. 10 while trying to board a plane at Katmandu airport during an earlier crackdown on political dissidents.
He was among 17 politicians and activists freed on orders of the Supreme Court on Monday, after the panel said the government did not have a valid reason for detaining them.
Though dozens of politicians and activists have been freed on court orders in recent days, at least 200 remain in jail.
The royalist government had rounded up hundreds of dissidents during raids on their homes and offices or crackdowns on protest rallies against the king since he grabbed power last year.
Gyanendra seized control of the government on Feb. 1, 2005, promising to crush a communist insurgency, and hold parliamentary elections within three years.
But he has drawn heavy protests from the country's main political parties and criticism from foreign governments, which have urged him to implement democracy immediately.

""To bomb schools is a senseless and cruel act against the children of Nepal,"" UNICEF Nepal spokesman, Suomi Sakai, said.
""When schools are scarce and more than half a million children are not in school in the first place, to wantonly destroy schools only helps push its children back into ignorance,"" she said.
The rebels have planted three bombs in empty private school buildings in western Nepal over the past week. No one was injured in the bombings.
The Private and Boarding School Organization-Nepal said the Maoist student wing had been bombarding schools with threatening e-mails and telephone calls, telling them to close unless they met the series of demands.
The army and King Gyanendra, who sacked a four-party coalition government on February 1 and assumed absolute power, have ordered the schools to remain open.

"5501",20061411,"Title: Nepal king marks key anniversary with poll pledge, rebel attack kills 20.rtf; Date: February 1, 2006 Wednesday 10:14 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra marked the first anniversary Wednesday of his seizure of power with a promise to push ahead with controversial local elections, as Maoist rebels launched major raids which killed at least 20 people.
A huge police presence meanwhile thwarted plans by Nepal's political opposition, which had branded the anniversary a ""black day"", to stage a mass protest rally in Kathmandu.
Gyanendra's speech drew an angry response from the parties -- sidelined in the king's powergrab -- who said the aid-dependent country was being pushed further into chaos.
An army official said around 1,000 rebel Maoists attacked at least five targets in Palpa district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of Kathmandu, late Tuesday in ferocious assaults that lasted until dawn.
""After the fighting finished, we found (the bodies of) three army personnel and 17 police officers,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The attacks began near midnight Tuesday and lasted until dawn Wednesday, he said, adding that of the 230 police officers on duty in Palpa overnight, 143 were still missing.
Gyanendra in a 20-minute televised address said the local elections, which he set for February 8 as part of his ""road map"" to restore democracy, would still be held. The rebels have threatened to ""take action"" against anyone taking part.
""The first and foremost preconditions for consolidating democracy are to gain the support of the people through the ballot and respect their mandate,"" the king said in his pre-recorded address.
""The process to reinstate all the elected bodies through free and fair elections has been initiated,"" he said, calling on the rebels to give up their campaign but making no direct reference to his takeover of power last year.
""His address today has made it clear that he wants to prolong his autocratic regime,"" said the spokesman for the Nepali Congress Party, Krishna Prasad Sitaula.
""His address has pushed the country into further crisis and chaos. The demonstrations will continue.""
However, the parties' plans for a mass rally at Kathmandu's Durbar Square,  scene of violent clashes between police and protesters last month, fell flat after police moved in to prevent crowds gathering.
From midday scores of police, some armed, were seen stopping pedestrians, patting them down and searching their bags around the square, the historical heart of the capital.
Fewer than 100 protestors made it to the square for the rally called for 2:00 pm (0815 GMT) and handfuls of young men threw stones at riot police.
Gyanendra sacked the elected government last February 1, saying it had not done enough to quell the Maoist insurgency, had failed to hold elections and was responsible for widespread corruption.
After taking over, Gyanendra jailed politicians, declared a state of emergency and cut off telecommunications.
Political parties and student groups have since staged periodic protests, including rallies last month which sparked running battles between police and activists in the historic heart of the capital.
In November the Maoists and the alliance announced a plan that would see the rebels give up their arms, and set the stage for polls for an assembly to draft a new constitution and determine the future of the monarchy.
But Gyanendra rejected the agreement and the rebels last month rescinded a unilateral truce. More than 120 people have since been killed.
""Nepalese have understood that terrorists giving a short break to their violence was just to reorganize themselves,"" Gyanendra said in his address.
The king has been severely criticised by the international community for his takeover. The United States, Britain and India have cut off arms shipments to the kingdom.
Washington on Tuesday said one year of ""palace rule"" had only worsened security and bolstered Maoist insurgents.

"5366",20065532,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists, government open crucial peace talks.rtf; Date: October 8, 2006 Sunday 8:35 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's government and Maoist rebels opened crucial peace talks here Sunday in their latest bid to turn the page on a decade of conflict.
The negotiations, resuming after a four-month pause, are aimed at hammering out a new, temporary constitution that would bring the communist insurgents into the impoverished Himalayan kingdom's political mainstream.
But the process has been slow-moving amid disputes over the future of Nepal's 238-year-old monarchy and what the rebels should do with their weapons.
""All the parties have put forward their views and we are trying to reach a common consensus,"" said Jhalanath Khanal, a member of the peace talks team with Nepal's second largest party, the Nepal Communist Party (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
""The taskforce of the eight parties (seven parties from the government and the rebels) will discuss the agenda in the next sitting and prepare a draft list of the outstanding issues,"" Khanal told journalists.
It is the second time the two sides have held top-level talks since mass protests in April, spearheaded by the Maoists and political parties in a loose alliance, forced King Gyanendra to end 14 months of absolute rule and restore parliament.
Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala -- who is hosting Sunday's talks at his residence -- has voiced cautious optimism.
""All the issues cannot be resolved immediately and at a single sitting. We need adequate patience. The talks may continue for two to four days but the dialogue will be successful,"" Koirala stressed Friday.
At least 12,500 people have been killed since the Maoist insurgency began a decade ago.
The rebels, who control large swathes of the countryside and have warned they will call for mass protests in the capital Kathmandu if talks fail, have been less upbeat.
""We're not 100 percent confident,"" Dev Gurung, a member of the rebel negotiating team, said in the run-up to Sunday's meeting.
The first meeting between Koirala and rebel leader Prachanda in June led to breakthrough plans for a temporary constitution to be drafted and for the Maoists to join a new interim government.
Little headway has been made since then.
The temporary constitution remains unfinished because the ruling seven-party alliance is divided on such issues as whether the king should stay, go or take on a more symbolic role.
The second round of high-level talks had been scheduled for late September, but was postponed because the alliance could not reach a consensus.
""If need be, the Maoists could go back to war tomorrow, they still have the strategy and they have kept their cadres prepared for it,"" said Rhoderick Chalmers, the deputy South Asia project director of the International Crisis Group, an organization working to prevent conflict worldwide.
""But for now it is still the least attractive option for them,"" he said.
The rebels have pledged they will not return to war.
Ordinary Nepalis are tired of war, said Tribhuvan University political science professor Kapil Shrestha.
""There's immense pressure from the Nepali people. The people have had enough of the conflict,"" the professor said.
This is the third time the rebels and government have tried to hammer out a peace deal, with previous attempts in 2001 and 2003 failing and plunging the impoverished nation back into conflict.

It has installed its communication network -- tele-communcation equipment company Huawei Technologies -- in the entire country.
Intelligence agencies deployed on Indo-Nepal border told TOI that China had two benefits from it. One, Nepali citizens would talk at cheaper rates and thus earn goodwill in each and every Nepali household. This would help China to influence India's neighbors in the long run. Secondly and importantly, China would have the data of telephonic conversations of all important officers, political leaders and corporate houses in Nepal. Sources said that all the important incoming calls from India and outgoing calls from Nepal would come into the notice of China. This could help it in formulating policies against India.
China has thrown educational net to give impetus to Maoists' agitation in Nepal and India. The main agitators of both the countries are being taught Chinese language in the hilly area of Nepal. Intelligence agencies have information that the Chinese language was being taught so that the Maoists of both the countries converse in Chinese and thus hoodwink Indian intelligence agencies which lack Chinese-language-knowing-staff.
The Chinese trainees, according to the sources, are residing in different 'Bodh maths' of India. The intelligence agencies claim that China was playing a game to fuel Maoists agitation in India and Nepal. China has increased its activities in Nepal after failure of Maoists to capture power in Nepal and suppression of Maoists rebellion in India.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 7 March
Kathmandu, 7 March: Gunther Baechler, special adviser for peace building in Nepal from the Swiss Foreign Ministry on Monday [6 March] said that the international community should leave the king with only one option - to provide serious offer for talks with the seven political parties and Maoists.
Presenting a paper, ""Peace in Nepal is triangular"", during an interaction organized by Ganeshman Singh Academy in Kathmandu, he stressed that India, being a close neighbour of Nepal, has a special role to exert pressure upon the king to return to the democratic process.
""International communities should facilitate talks among political parties and Maoists in order to stop armed violence, promote an all-inclusive peace process and balance the power asymmetry among the two parties due to the fact that one of them disposes of armed forces,"" he said in the paper. He also stated that the international community should keep reliable channels to the palace open in order to promote dialogue. 
Similarly, leaders from various parties and political analysts stressed the need to encourage understanding between political parties and Maoists. They also urged Maoists to immediately abandon violence and express full commitment to the 12-point understanding. ""Initiatives and the lead taken by political parties to bring Maoists to the peaceful and democratic fold should be encouraged and supported. The state should proceed toward ceasefire and peace negotiations,"" Nilambar Acharya, former minister and political analyst said.
Presenting a paper during the programme, Acharya also said democratic forces in the country were facing two autocracies: the existing autocracy in the form of absolute monarchy and an aspiring autocracy in the form of Maoist insurgency. ""Democratic forces can't sit and wait for one autocratic force to overcome the other and consolidate its autocratic position,"" he said in the paper.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Minendra Rijal, central working committee member of Nepali Congress (Democratic), said that the 12-point understanding with Maoists could provide a way out of the current political stalemate. ""But until and unless Maoists abandon violence and implement the commitments made in the 12-point pact, the distance between Maoists and political parties will continue to increase,"" he said

At least 38 people have died in heavy flooding and landslides across the region, where homes have been swept away and crops destroyed.
In Nepal, officials said 11 people had died this week in floods and landslides.
They said thousands of others were hit by the flooding, which disrupted road transport and shut down schools and markets in towns and villages in rain-lashed southern plains.
""Dozens of houses have been swept away and the crops damaged,"" said district administrator Durga Prasad Bhandari from the town of Gaur, southwest of the capital Kathmandu.
Swirling floods in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, which adjoins Nepal, swept away 14 people and wreaked havoc, said officials.
Two million people were affected by the floods, which inundated homes and farms in India's second most populous state, they said.
Twelve people were killed in worst-hit Bhagalpur district, while two people drowned elsewhere in the state, the Press Trust of India quoted relief officials as saying.
The overnight deaths took India's rain-related toll to almost 800 since the onset of the monsoon in June, according to figures compiled from officials and media reports.
Authorities in Assam and Meghalaya appealed for help from the military after landslips and flash floods killed 13 more people and displaced around 750,000 people in the two adjoining states.
A spokesman for the Assam state government said nine people died when large boulders crashed into a rain-swept settlement. Four people drowned overnight in separate incidents, he said.
Food, water and medicines were being distributed to the affected people, Dhemaji district magistrate D.N. Mishra said by telephone.
Assam water resources minister Bharat Narah said preventive measures, including the strengthening of dykes and embankments, were being taken.
Overflowing rivers also burst their banks in India's West Bengal state, which borders Assam. The flood waters submerged homes and an under-construction hydro-power station, officials in state capital Kolkata said.

Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
Dehradun, 14 November [Friday]: Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda Friday said his country was ready to work jointly with India to develop more hydropower projects on the lines of the 6000-MW Pancheshwar dam.
""A lot of hydropower potential has been identified in Nepal. We would like to develop more power projects with India. Why Pancheshwar only?,"" Prachanda told reporters at Jolly Grant Airport after visiting Asia's highest Tehri dam.
Pointing to the changed political situation in his country, he said Nepal and India would work jointly in other fields also with an aim to develop the region.
When asked whether Nepal would prefer dam based power projects or run-of-the-river projects, Prachanda said his country would build both.
The Rs 30,000-crore [one crore is 10 millions] Pancheshwar dam, which is proposed on the river Mahakali on Uttarakhand-Nepal border, has a lot of similarities with Tehri dam which displaced over one lakh people.
A lunch was also hosted in honour of the Nepalese premier which was attended by Uttarakhand Chief Minister B C Khanduri.
Earlier in the day, Prachanda travelled to the 2400-MW Tehri dam site on a chopper. He also went inside the powerhouse and showed keen interest in the functioning of the plant. Prachanda said he went there to study various aspects of the hydel project.
Prachanda's visit to Uttarakhand is expected to give a new lease of life to Pancheshwar dam which is hanging fire since the last one decade especially in the wake of Maoist violence in the neighbouring nation.
India and Nepal held a series of meetings related to the dam and also decided to set up a Pancheshwar Development Authority.

Faced with growing calls for democratic reform and near daily protests, the government issued an order last week banning all public gatherings in the capital, Katmandu. Despite the ban, students nationwide coordinated rallies for Wednesday.
Police fired into the air to disperse an anti-government rally in Nepalgunj, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, after students pelted stones at them.
Police and witnesses said at least a dozen people were injured in the clash, but few details were immediately available. Witnesses said a few thousand people had attended the protest.
Students had called a general strike in the town, and shops and businesses were still shut after the rally.
A protest also took place in the eastern industrial city of Biratnagar, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Katmandu, with police arresting 30 people, according to police and witnesses.
Up to 4,000 student protesters gathered in Katmandu, but their rally was thwarted when police detained dozens and packed them into vans.
Nepal has been mired in political turmoil since King Gyanendra dismissed an elected government and replaced it with a pro-monarchy one in October 2002, as Maoist rebels stepped up attacks following the collapse of a cease-fire.
The government is now headed by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a loyalist to the king.
The demonstrators are calling for immediate parliamentary elections, claiming the current government is unconstitutional.
Despite the regular protests, the king has ignored the demands.
The Maoist insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives since 1996.
The rebels, who claim inspiration from late Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, want to abolish the country's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.

"2883",20041507,"Title: YEAR END REVIEW 2004 OF MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.rtf; Date: December 30, 2004 Thursday 10:08 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Dec 30 -- The Government of India's Ministry of External Affairs issued the following press release:
  Year End Review 2004
  The UPA Government has come out with a foreign policy which is purposeful, result-oriented and pro-active. India, today, enjoys a unique profile in the international arena as a factor of stability, a model of plural and secular democracy and an economic powerhouse that is destined to play a greater role in the international affairs.
  India's emergence as a compulsory destination in the itineraries of leaders from all parts of the world reflects the high standing and credibility that the Government and its leadership enjoy.
  Amongst the earliest crisis that the Government faced was the kidnapping of three Indians for ransom in Iraq. After more than a month's long patience and delicate effort, the Government was able to ensure safe return of hostages without sacrificing any principles. The successful and mature handling this crisis set the stage for reorientation of Indian Foreign Policy in the service of the nation in a rapidly transforming and ever more challenging global environment.
  HIGH PRIORITY TO RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS
  The Government has re-focused India's Foreign Policy giving high priority to relations with all its neighbours. The Minister for External Affairs chose Nepal for his first visit after taking over his office. A number of high level visits have been hosted from the neighbouring countries, including both the President and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of Nepal and Foreign Minister, Commerce Minister and Finance Minister of Bangladesh have been among the recent visitors. A major landmark has been the visit of the Head of State of Myanmar to Delhi in November this year, the first such visit in 26 years. This has resulted in important cross-border projects being taken up and coordinated action to deal with insurgency in border areas.
  The Government's engagement with India's neighbours has not been limited only to Government-to-Government level but has consciously encompassed different sections of society and across the political spectrum. The UPA Government believes that it is important to have frequent and regular contacts and wide-ranging discussions with the neighbouring countries at all levels to take forward and to maximize opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. At the same time, the Government has not hesitated to address issues where there may be differences, but has done so in a spirit of friendship and in a constructive search for practical and mutually acceptable solutions. This will be the approach to the forthcoming SAARC Summit, which will be held in Dhaka in January 2005. The present Government remains committed to a collective future of peace and prosperity for the entire South Asian region.
  A SUSTAINED & COMPREHENSIVE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH PAKISTAN
  With Pakistan, the Government has put behind reactive policy, which frequently oscillated between euphoria and despair. The Government now has engaged in a sustained and comprehensive dialogue process. It will not be deflected by transient developments and often contradictory pronouncement from the other side of the border. The Government's confidence in taking this process forward is reflected in the number of wide-ranging confidence building measures that it has put on table, including several on unilateral basis. Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, has clearly enunciated the parameters within which India seeks peace with Pakistan.
  INTENSIFYING RELATIONS WITH CHINA
  The Government has managed to intensify relations with China. Prime Minister recently met the Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jia Bao, during the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane. The Chinese leader said that the most important item on his agenda in 2005 would be his visit to India in March 2005. Two rounds of talks have already been held between the special representatives of the two countries on the boundary question. The importance of the relationship is also reflected in the visits recently of two senior Chinese State Councillors and Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister for External Affairs, four times in three months in Qingtao, Jakarta, New York and Almaty. During his visit to India, State Councillor Tang Jia Xuar recognised the active role that India could play in international affairs and in the Security Council.
  BROAD RANGE OF DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S.
  For India, relations with the US are special because both are vibrant democracies. India's relations are being expanded across the board. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh met President Bush in New York in September 2004, which resulted in a strong reaffirmation of the strategic partnership between the two countries. The Secretary of Defence, Rumsfeld, visited New Delhi in December. India's perspectives on specific issues may be different and that may lead to differences in pol"

But unlike in Nepal, India has very limited scope for action in Sri Lanka. Reason: the government has no dealings with one of the two parties in the conflict, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
  The cabinet committee on security met on Thursday to discuss the options amid the rising clamour for India to act.However, sources said the options were clearly limited. India cannot intervene in Sri Lanka by sending in troops nor can it sell ""offensive weapons"" to the Lankan army, as the Tamil minority should not be seen at a disadvantage. This was one of the reasons why India did not sign a defence cooperation agreement with the island nation. India's cooperation with the Lankan armed forces is restricted to training of personnel.
  Also, India cannot actively mediate as a peacemaker without accepting conditions of the LTTE, which is banned in this country. Given the political compulsions and sensitivities ahead of the polls in Tamil Nadu, New Delhi finds its hands largely tied. That leaves India with two options: it can step up patrolling of the waterways to curb the passage of armaments and supplies to the LTTE. And urge Colombo to maintain maximum restraint to try and keep the cease-fire functional.
  Patrolling along the Tamil Nadu coast has already been intensified and emotions in the state will remain controlled if refugees do not arrive in droves. No refugee had arrived since the Tuesday attack at the army headquarters. India has watched with increasing concern as the cease-fire agreement in Sri Lanka - between the government and the LTTE - has come under ""severe strain"" since the government of President Mahinda Rajapakse assumed charge in December 2005. At least 130 armed forces personnel have been killed since then. But Colombo has been ""restrained"" in its responses, only striking back after the attack on army chief Sharath Fonseka. ""It was almost a declaration of war by the LTTE,"" an analyst said of the attack. ""The ball is now in the LTTE's court.""

"4808",2006740,"Title: Maoist strike paralyses Nepal towns but not the capital.rtf; Date: February 5, 2006 Sunday 7:27 AM GMT; Text: A general strike called by Maoist rebels to disrupt controversial elections this week brought Nepali towns to a standstill but had little immediate effect in the capital Sunday, witnesses said.
The rebels -- who want to depose King Gyanendra and turn the poverty-stricken Himalayan country into a communist state -- called the week-long strike to disrupt Wednesday's scheduled local elections.
The guerrillas are believed to have killed two candidates and have pledged to step up attacks in the run-up to polling day.
The royal government, which has been rocked by recent street protests, has told Nepalis to ignore the strike call and threatened to arrest those who try to stop businesses from opening or who vandalize property.
In the capital, most people appeared to heed the warning Sunday. Fewer taxis and buses were on the streets, but many businesses decided to open.
""I would not have minded closing for a day, but for seven days it is very difficult,"" said coffee shop owner Jeevan Giri. ""How am I supposed to survive?""
However, in Nepalgunj, 510 kilometres (320 miles) west of Kathmandu, the strike brought activities to a standstill, a local journalist said, speaking by telephone from the gateway town to the Maoist dominated mid-western region.
""Normal life has been severely disrupted. Only vehicles belonging to security forces are on the streets,"" said Janak Nepal from the town of around 150,000 people close to the Indian border.
In Biratnagar the strike also paralysed daily life, another journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""All markets are closed and not a single vehicle is on the streets, and there is a heavy security presence,"" said the journalist from the town 540 kilometres east of Kathmandu.
In the capital, the government had commandeered around 500 vehicles to break the strike, private media reported, but by Sunday morning there was no need to use them as motorcycles, cars and taxis were all plying the streets.
Nepal's capital and the surrounding Kathmandu valley have generally been shielded from the climate of insecurity and fear the decade-old insurgency has created elsewhere in the country.
But on occasion Maoist strikes and blockades have paralysed the ancient  capital of 1.5 million people and disrupted the delivery of goods. Military convoys have accompanied vehicles to prevent rebel attacks.
Tension has risen recently, on the first anniversary of Gyanendra's sacking of the elected government, a step he justified by saying he needed emergency powers to quell the rebellion that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
Wednesday's polls are part of the king's declared ""road map"" to democracy. He has pledged they will be followed by general elections in the next 15 months. 
But the municipal elections are opposed by the Maoists and opposition parties, who have formed a loose anti-royal alliance. They condemn the polls as a sham aimed at legitimising the king's power grab.
The recent killings of two candidates meant that voter turnout on Wednesday was likely to be small, the head of a human rights organization said.
""People have been terrified after recent incidents, so turnout will be very thin,"" said Subodh Pyakurel, chairman of the Informal Sector Service Centre.
There has been a dearth of candidates, and many of those that are standing are under government protection.
By holding the polls, ""the king is trying to give legitimacy"" to those who ""do not represent the actual voice of the people,"" said Dhurba Hari Adhikari, president of the Nepal Press Institute.

 Kathmandu, 17 November: The instance of Nepal 1 television channel telecasting scenes of the highway clash between the Maoist rebels and the army today appears to have kicked off an altogether different rivalry between it and Space Time Network Pvt Ltd, which runs a cable network.
 Things have come to such a pass that the latter has stopped airing Nepal 1 to households which depend on it for satellite telecast in the city.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 18 Nov 04Though the service was available in the morning, it was cut off by afternoon.
 While Space Time Network sources attributed the action to ""negative reaction from the people who feel that the footage telecast by Nepal 1 lionized the Maoist rebels,"" a Nepal 1 source claimed that the telecast had ""probably set in an element of envy among concerned sections since they had failed to procure the footage.""
 ""We have done what we have done just because they telecast footage which should not have been at all. Whatever people saw must have boosted the image of the rebels as a force. Hence, the action on prompting from viewers,"" said Kedar Koirala, chief reporter of Space Time Network, when asked to cite the reason behind the discontinuation of cable service to Nepal 1.
 On the other hand, Nepal 1 bureau chief Shankar Jha attributed the action to the intensifying rivalry between the two entities. ""Of course, we do not perceive any military or government intervention against us. We take it as pure business rivalry,"" Jha insisted, ruling out speculations that the army had pressed Space Time Network to deny service to Nepal 1, which had aired footage of rebels going on a rampage along Prithvi Highway leaving five army personnel dead.

Addressing the US Council of Foreign Relations, Singh said India was committed to facing the challenges posed by globalization and was determined to tackle terrorism, noting defence cooperation was growing rapidly. Referring to ""disturbing signs"" of protectionism in the US, Singh urged Washington to stand firm on free trade. The following is the text of a report by T.V. Parasuram, carried by Indian news agency PTI
 Washington, 24 September: Stressing the need for a ""shared struggle"" against global terror, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Friday 24 September said India and US now have a mature relationship wherein both could cooperate in preventing violence and deprivation of millions of people of dignified lives. ""Our relations have reached a stage of maturity, in which we can manage our differences in a rational and practical manner. There is a mutuality of interests and complementarity of major objectives,"" Singh said, addressing the Council on Foreign Relations here.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 2027 gmt 24 Sep 04
""This is sound basis for a durable partnership in the enterprise we are engaged in - the building of a stable, secure, prosperous and equitable world order. In essence, therefore, my message is simple - we are on the same side. And as I have said before, the best is yet to be.""
 Singh emphasized ""an extraordinary responsibility"" rested on India and the US, of ensuring that the future of mankind is not afflicted by the scourge of violence and large-scale deprivation that denied millions of human beings the dignified lives they deserve. ""History will judge us by our efforts to rid the world of the two menaces of violence and exclusion,"" he said. Singh said the Indo-US relationship has reached a stage where it can serve this larger global cause. India's determination to fight the scourge of terror is second to none, he said, adding that it ""is a shared struggle and one in which we should find it possible to do a great deal more together."" Noting that India for decades has paid a price of terror in human lives that cannot be equalled anywhere, Singh said: ""We have not let it weaken our resolve or undermine the fundamental values on which our society"" is based.
 India is committed to face the challenges posed by globalization, Singh said, adding that his government is committed to ""strengthen and deepen"" reforms so that the country can benefit from the ""tremendous opportunities which the global economy offers today"".
 ""But we will also ensure that there is better distribution of benefits. Our vision of 'inclusive politics' is rooted in a vision of liberal economies,"" he told the audience consisting mainly of American opinion makers. Singh pointed out that recently India and US have embarked on a forward-looking programme which envisages cooperation in civilian space applications, nuclear energy, high technology commerce and a dialogue on missile defence. ""As we move forward on the basis of trust and confidence,"" he said, ""there are ever widening prospects for cooperation in these areas"".
 ""Our defence cooperation is growing rapidly. We also have close cooperation on counter-terrorism, whose benefits are extensive and measurable.
 ""In Nepal and Sri Lanka, the US has supported India's approach in strengthening peace and stability by supporting democratic forces, constitutional processes and political dialogue. In Afghanistan, India strongly supported US-led efforts to replace the repressive Taleban regime and to eliminate the Al-Qa'idah menace. We remain deeply involved in assisting the democratic government of Afghanistan in its national reconstruction efforts.""
 Addressing several investors present in the select audience, Singh said India's growth ambitions need ""massive investments"" in the infrastructure sector. ""United States can play a major role in this area. The United States can also help in sustaining India's efforts to globalize by remaining true to your own traditional commitment to freer trade.""
 Referring to the ""disturbing signs"" of protectionism in the United States, Singh said they run counter to everything America has stood for. When India and other developing countries are beginning to be won over by the persuasiveness of the case for globalization, I hope the arguments will not be lost here.""
 ""We count on the United States standing firm to free trade and open access,"" he emphasized. New partnerships have to escape the straitjacket of old paradigms, Singh said. ""Looking beyond our bilateral relationship I believe we can also be partners in developing a global perspective on creating a new and durable structure for international cooperation.""
 ""It is remarkable that the world order of 1945 dominates global decision-making even today. The architecture of all our major international organizations "

New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement that thousands of child soldiers who are confined in camps under a peace accord should be freed and allowed to return to their families.
The group said it has written a letter to Nepal's Minister of Women, Children and Social Welfare Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma ""to secure the Maoists cooperation with the United Nations and child protection agencies to allow children to return home without further delay.""
The group claimed that out of the 31,000 former Maoist combatants in these camps, an estimated 6,000-8,000 are believed to be under the age of 18.
Under the peace deal signed last year between the Maoists and the government, thousands of their combatants were confined in camps under U.N. supervision and their weapons locked up.
The Maoists have since joined Parliament and an interim government which is to conduct elections later this year.
Bishwakarma, also a member of the Maoists in government, could not be reached for comment but the Maoists have repeatedly denied having recruited anyone under the age of 18 in their armed division.
The U.N., which has completed collecting information from ex-combatants in the camps, has said it would begin a second round of age verification.
""There's no excuse for letting children languish in cantonment sites month after month. Under the terms of Nepal's peace agreement, these children should be released immediately so they can enter rehabilitation programs, get back into school, and rejoin their families,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

    ""The valley life is normal. Dwellers are not panicking over the so-called blockade, as the government has been able to keep the  price of food items and petroleum products under control,"" Deputy  Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari told reporters here Monday.
    He also called on the owners of the closed industries and  hotels to resume business, reaffirming the government's commitment to provide security to them.
    ""We are ready to sit for peace talks without any conditions  with the rebels, and we will present ourselves with maximum  flexibility in the talks if it takes place,"" he added.
    The guerrillas announced an indefinite blockade targeting Nepal 's capital since Aug. 18. They attempted to block three main entry points in and around the Kathmandu Valley in a bid to force the  government to accept their pre-condition for peace talks,  including re-writing the Constitution.
    This is the first time the country's capital is blocked by the  insurgents, since they imposed a similar embargo in the western  Nepal for nearly one month earlier this year.
    The highway leading south and west serves as the capital's  lifeline of about 1.5 million population, the main route for  bringing in food, cooking gas, petroleum products and other  essentials. The other highway also links the Kathmandu Valley with Nepal's northern neighbor China, making it a vital trade route.
    During the first day of the blockade last Wednesday, the  highways saw only 67 vehicles entered in the Valley. However, when the blockade entered its seventh day on Tuesday, the volume of  traffic on the highways in the western parts of the capital seems  to have increased considerably.
    According to an officer at a checkpoint, hundreds of tons of  vegetables were supplied to the capital from Monday night to  Tuesday morning. While hundreds of buses and trucks lined up at  the three main entry points in and around the Kathmandu Valley  Tuesday morning, waiting to pass through the security checkpoint.
    Convoys of buses and trucks can be seen following a mine- protected vehicle of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and over-flying  RNA choppers also guarded.
    The government has provided tight security, escorting convoys  of goods-carriers and passenger buses on highways. The security  forces seem to be doing their best, patrolling key strategic  points along the highways.
    The army has mobilized 11 picket teams to guard the highway  from strategic points on hilltops along the 90 kilometers section  of the Prithvi Highway.
    The army base in coordination with the police has mobilized  several teams of security forces in the sensitive sections of the  highway. Besides, troops in plain clothes have been deployed  deeper along the highway to check the possible infiltration of the guerrillas.
    ""We have initiated various measures to ensure security on the  highways that link the capital with other parts of the country and escorting vehicles, running covert operations, picketing on the  highways and also conducting aerial patrolling so with these  security measures in place,"" said RNA General Brigadier Nepal  Bhusan Chand.
    ""There was nothing to be afraid of on the highways."" Chand said, adding, ""There is not a single case of resistance or obstruction,  neither is there any room for one. The highway is under our  control and fully safe.""
    ""Everyone loves his life, I am no exception but I have urgent  work to do in Narayanghat, so I am going."" said Ravilal Kayastha,  a local driver of a red car with its number plate covered with a  black plastic bag.

The marchers carried symbolic black flags and placards denouncing ""the reactionary forces.""
The protesters, however, refrained from criticizing the king by name, an offense with potential legal repercussions in Nepal.
Riot police tried to arrest one demonstrator who hoisted an effigy of an anonymous ""reactionary,"" but were prevented when students in the crowd threw stones at the police, who were protected by shields made of bamboo and plastic.
No injuries were reported. Parallel protests were held Saturday in other parts of Nepal, according to activists.
The demonstrations were organized by five parties including the two largest from the dissolved parliament: the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML).
The five parties had Thursday announced a campaign to restore the democratic government, which was met by a home ministry warning that ""strong action"" would be taken against anyone who threatened ""peace and security.""
The protest campaign is supported by the Maoist rebels who have been observing a ceasefire with Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's government since January. The two sides held a second round of peace talks Friday.
Chand, known as a staunch royalist, was appointed in October by King Gyanendra who sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling the elected leader ""incompetent.""
""We are demanding either an all-party government which will manage new parliamentary elections or the reinstatement of the parliament dissolved in May,"" said NCP-UML activist Prabhat Kueinkel.
Elections that had been called last year under Deuba have been indefinitely postponed by the king.

 Kathmandu: General Secretary of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] Madhav Kumar Nepal who was under house arrest since the 1 February royal move, has been freed after 90 days.

Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 3 May 05
General Secretary Nepal said that though the announcement has been made regarding the lifting of emergency, many leaders detained during emergency have not been freed, so in reality the emergency has not been lifted.

 He said that the movement would be focussed on shifting the state governance from the hands of king to the hands of people. ""All the decisions made after 1 February are unconstitutional. The Royal Commission for Corruption Control, zonal administrators, regional administrators are among them,"" Nepal said. [passage omitted: Nepal said that the king took advantage of the political parties' courtesy.]

All the majo daily newspapers including Annapurna Post, The Himalayan Times, The Kathmandu Post, Kantipur, Nepal Samacharpatra, Rajdhani, Himalaya Times have left the editorial blanks. The protest is also supported by Image Channel TV, Image News FM, Nepal, Kantipur TV, Kantipur FM, myrepublica.com, dainikee.com, e-Kantipur, Newsfront, Nepali Times and Himal Khabarpatrika.
""This is the first in a series of escalating protests that our media companies will launch if the current organised attacks on us by groups affiliated to the ruling party are not stopped immediately,"" the statement said.
The journalists of the Himal media including chief editor Kunda Dixit were attacked by the Maoists affiliated workers union on Sunday.
""We feel the attack on Himal media and other media houses represent a serious threat to press freedom, democracy and pluralism in this country, and it is ironical that it should be perpetrated by a group affiliated to a party that won the election and leads the government,"" it added.
The Media Society and Editors' Alliance group the publishers and owners of most of Nepal's major National Newspapers and Magazines, TV stations and Radio had a meeting yesterday and took serious note of the escalation of violent attacks on media.
The raid on Himal media on Sunday, in which 12 people were injured, was the latest in a series of attacks and threats against newspapers, TV stations and Radio all over the country in the past.
""We feel enough is enough,"" they said in the statement. Besides blank editorials, TV stations will also carry a message after the signature tune instead of the headlines on their news broadcasts, and similar announcements on radio news bulletins and news portals.
They said the incidents of violent intimidation were politically motivated, and demanded a full public apology from the CPN-Maoist, a credible commitment not to repeat such attacks on the Fourth Estate and to abide by the rule of law. In turn, the publishers also said they will continue to abide by all the laws of the land.
The statement was signed by Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Nepal Media Society and Kunda Dixit, convenor of the Editors' Alliance.

""We have agreed to hold the constituent assembly elections by the end of November and the eight party leaders have given the responsibility to the government to fix the date,"" Ramchandra Poudel, Nepal's minister for peace and reconstruction, told AFP.
The elections to vote for a body to rewrite Nepal's constitution had been slated for June 20, but Nepal's top election official has repeatedly said more time was needed to prepare.
""The prime minister has proposed November 26 as election day, but it has not been approved by the leaders of the eight parties,"" said C.P. Mainali, leader of the United Left Front party.
Nepal's former rebel Maoists ended their decade-long civil war late last year, and have been given five ministerial portfolios in the recently formed government led by eight political parties.
The elections will decide the future, if any, of Nepal's embattled monarch King Gyanendra who has been stripped of most of his powers after being forced to end a much-criticised 14-month period of authoritarian rule last April.
The fiercely anti-monarchy Maoists want the interim government to declare a republic before the polls.
""Our party thinks that we will not be able to hold the elections without declaring a republic through parliament so we have sent a note of dissent on the election date agreement to the other party leaders,"" said Dinanath Sharma, a senior Maoist leader.
Nepal's parliament, formed in January, will need to amend the the interim constitution in the next two weeks, said Poudel, the peace minister.
""We have also agreed to amend the interim constitution and formulate the necessary election laws by mid-June,"" he said.
At least 13,000 people were killed in the former rebels' 'People's War' launched in western Nepal in 1996.
As part of a landmark peace deal reached late last year, the ultra-leftists have placed their weapons and 'People's Liberation Army' in camps under United Nations supervision.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 11 May
Kathmandu, 11 May: The seven-party alliance (SPA) meeting held at the Prime Minister's residence at Baluatar on Thursday [11 May] ended without deciding upon the name of the Speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR). Though the Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)] agreed upon the name of UML leader Subash Nemwang for the Speaker of the House, NC-D and other parties proposed that Deputy Speaker Chitra Lekha Yadav be given the post. Nepal Sadbhavan Party (Anandidevi), too, proposed Yadav's name for the post. UML leaders, however, said that the Speaker should be chosen from their party as they had agreed to give the home and defence ministry portfolios to the NC. 
The meeting concluded indecisively after NC-D leaders abandoned the meeting following the disagreement over the Speaker's name. According to sources, NC-D President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Standing Committee members Ramesh Lekahak and Gyanendra Karki left the meeting expressing dissatisfaction over Prime Minister Koirala's decision to nominate Nemwang. 
The meeting's failure to reach a consensus over the Speaker's name also marred the prospects of cabinet expansion today. ""The issue of cabinet expansion will be dealt with only after deciding upon the Speaker's name first,"" a leader involved in today's meeting said.  He also said that parliament would choose the Speaker through an election ""soon"", if the SPA cannot agree upon a consensus name for the post. ""Nemwang is likely to be elected as the Speaker as he enjoys the support of the NC and the UML,"" he added.
Over the issue of forming talks team to hold dialogue with the Maoist rebels, the SPA meeting decided to constitute a peace secretariat and ""soon"" form a talks team representing each of the seven parties.  The Maoists announced a three-member talks team headed by party spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara yesterday. The SPA meeting is to continue tomorrow.

""I think we're in business,"" Deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown told journalists after winding up talks between dozens of member states to thrash out the rules of engagement and composition of the planned 15,000 strong force.
""We've had a lot of interesting offers this afternoon, some fairly firm, some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations,"" he said.
""The show's on the road, we're in business, but there's a lot of work to be done in the coming days to meet the deadline that we insisted on in this meeting, which is that we have 3,500 additional troops deployed within 10 days.""
While Malloch Brown declined to offer precise numbers, other diplomatic sources here said that at least six countries had given firm offers of troops, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Denmark and Germany.
France earlier said it would offer troops, though not the large commanding role the UN had earlier said it had hoped Paris would play.
The force is due to deploy in southern Lebanon along with Lebanese forces to police a ceasefire between Shiite militia Hezbollah and Israel, as agreed under the terms of a UN resolution adopted last week.

"5984",20073704,"Title: Nepal politicians warn election likely to be postponed amid stalemate with Maoists.rtf; Date: October 4, 2007 Thursday 3:18 PM GMT; Text: Upcoming national elections are likely to be postponed in this Himalayan nation, government officials warned Thursday, as leaders of Nepal's ruling parties struggled to end a political stalemate and draw the former Maoist rebels back into the interim government.
Mainstream party officials and the Maoists, who quit the government last month, came to the end of two days of talks Thursday without resolving the crisis that threatens to derail the Nov. 22 elections for the Constituent Assembly, which is to craft a new constitution and chart out Nepal's political future.
The parties and the Maoists agreed to meet again Friday at 7 a.m. just three hours before the deadline for filing nominations for the assembly elections.
""The chance of an election being held on time is minimal,"" Ram Chandra Poudel, a top government minister, told reporters after the talks ended. ""Without the cooperation of the Maoists, an election is not possible.""
Citing the impasse, the Maoists said the vote should be delayed.
""We want the electoral process to be suspended for now,"" Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said.
The Maoists had earlier given the government until midnight Thursday to agree to their demands, including the immediate abolition of the monarchy and procedural changes to the elections. They have threatened to launch widespread street protests if their demands are not met.
While mainstream leaders have said they want the monarchy abolished, disagreement over the procedural issues have kept the two sides at an impasse.
Few, if any, political leaders were optimistic about the talks, which were being held at the heavily guarded official compound of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
Last week, the Nepal Congress, the country's leading party, announced its support for declaring the country a republic, moving the government closer to abolishing the monarchy that ruled for centuries. The king remains on the throne, but was stripped of nearly all his power last year in the wake of massive street protests.
But the ex-rebels insist the Constituent Assembly elections be based entirely on proportional representation, where voters cast ballots for political parties which in turn appoint members to the assembly.
Earlier this year, they had agreed to a mixed election system, where half the assembly members would be chosen through proportional representation, with the other half directly elected by the public.
Most analysts believe the rebels want a proportional election because they have few leaders with enough stature to earn many votes in a direct election.
The government, though, opposes an election based solely on proportional voting.
Nepal, which came to the brink of chaos last year before the king gave up power, again plunged into political crisis last month after the Maoists' pulled out of the government and announced plans to disrupt the assembly elections.
The Maoists, who fought a decade-long armed insurgency to abolish the monarchy, signed a peace agreement in 2006 and joined the government earlier this year. More than 13,000 people were killed in the fighting.

 Turkey is a route of illegal migration due to its geographical location lying between Asia and Europe like a bridge with its rough mountainous eastern and southeastern borders difficult to control.
 Illegal immigrants from Middle Eastern, Asian and Far Eastern countries generally use this route to sneak into European countries. In the West, northwestern Edirne province and some other Aegean provinces are routes for illegal immigrants to cross the border. Particularly Meric River, a natural border between Turkey and Greece, and Aegean provinces which are close to Greek Islands in the Aegean Sea are used by illegal immigrants to go to European countries. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of illegal immigrants who were caught by the Turkish security forces who stepped up security measures against illegal migration.

"2093",20043050,"Title: Iraqi paper lists _resistance_ and _armed_ groups, aims.rtf; Date: September 20, 2004, Monday; Text: The Iraqi Journalists Union newspaper Al-Zawra has published a report on Iraqi ""resistance groups"" and ""armed groups"", describing their aims and affiliation to ""clarify"" the picture on Iraqi violence. The paper lists the groups under three categories, the ""Sunni resistance groups that primarily target US occupation"", the ""Shi'i resistance against occupation"" and ""factions which adopt abductions and killing"". The ""common denominators"" of the resistance groups are killing US soldiers, rejecting abductions or killing of hostages and attacks on Iraqi policemen and respecting the beliefs of other religions, the paper says. These groups have grown gradually until they ""matured"" and acquired their own political and military ""personality"" and weight, the paper said. The majority of these groups do not know their leadership, the sources of their financing or weapons, the paper said. The following is the text of report by Samir Haddad and Mazin Ghazi entitled ""Who kills hostages in Iraq?"", published by Iraqi Journalists Union newspaper Al-Zawra on 19 September; the main groups highlighted as subheadings:
 US soldiers guard the wreckage of a military armoured vehicle destroyed by the Iraqi resistance. In Iraq, the issues are even more confused now than they were before. This happened after an armed group abducted two French journalists and threatened to kill them if France did not revoke the law banning religious symbols at schools, including the veil, and another group abducted two Italian women in Baghdad. The issues became even more confused when a third group killed 12 Nepalese workers, claiming that they were serving the US forces.
Al-Zawra, Baghdad, in Arabic 19 Sep 04 p 4
It is our duty now to clarify the picture with regard to who targets civilians and foreigners, who abducts hostages indiscriminately, and who makes the US occupation and its soldiers their main preoccupation.
 After the fall of Baghdad into the hands of the Anglo-American occupation on 9 April 2003, as a natural reaction, several sectors of Iraqi society confronted the occupation. Resistance cells were formed, the majority of which were of Islamic Sunni and pan-Arab tendencies. These cells started in the shape of scattered groups, without a unifying bond to bind them together.
 These groups and small cells started to grow gradually, until they matured to some extent and acquired a clear personality that had its own political and military weight. Then they stated to combine themselves into larger groups.
 The majority of these groups do not know their leadership, the sources of their financing or who provides them with weapons. However, the huge amounts of weapons, which the Saddam Husayn regime left behind, are undoubtedly one of the main sources for arming these groups. These weapons include mortars, RPGs, hand grenades, Kalashnikovs and light weapons.
 Their intellectual tendencies are usually described as a mixture of Islamic and pan-Arab ideas that agree on the need to put an end to the US presence in Iraq.
 These groups have common denominators, the most important of which perhaps are focusing on killing US soldiers, rejecting the abductions and the killing of hostages, rejecting the attacks on Iraqi policemen and respecting the beliefs of other religions. There is no compulsion to convert to Islam, this stems from their Islamic creed, their reading of the jurisprudence texts and historical events, and their respect for the directives and appeals of the Islamic organizations and religious dignitaries.
 These groups believe the Iraqis are divided into two categories. One category - the majority - is against the occupation, and the other - the minority - is on the side of the occupation. The resistance considers those who reject the occupation, whatever their description might be, to be on its side. The resistance considers those who are on the side of the occupation to be as spies and traitors who do not deserve to remain on Iraqi territory, and hence they should be liquidated.
 As for their view of the political parties, it depends on the stance of these parties towards the occupation. If these parties are dealing with the United States on the basis that it is an occupation force that should be evicted and that Iraq should be liberated from any military occupation or constrictions, and if these parties choose to deal with the United States and to engage in political action within this context, then these parties are free to continue with their efforts. Moreover, in general, these groups do not target the political powers that deal, but do not cooperate with the United States within the political framework established by the occupation.
 The following is a review of the resistance groups and the armed groups in Iraq:
 First, the main Sunni resistance groups that primarily target US occupation

Officials said small customs offices are becoming ineffective to check smuggling along the porous Nepal-India border due to insufficient human resources and physical infrastructure.
High concentration of trade through main customs points in recent years have rendered majority of small customs useless. There are a total of 143 small customs and 31 main customs points across the border with China and India.
""We have decided to merge 47 poorly manned small customs with nearby main customs keeping into account transportation facility, adjoining market and existing and future trade prospects through those customs,"" Tanka Mani Sharma, director general of Department of Customs (DoC) told Republica.
The department is currently doing homework to assess existing workforce at major customs points. After completing its assessment, the department will arrange additional workforce for customs points that need to be strengthened.
Sharma told Republica that Nepal and India during the recently held customs director general level meeting agreed to merge ineffective small customs with nearby main customs.
The DoC is soon submitting the revised lists of customs offices to the Ministry of Finance. The ministry will then forward the list to the cabinet for endorsement.
""We will implement the new set up once the proposal is endorsed,"" added Sharma.
Unchecked smuggling of goods through small customs was one of the agendas raised during bilateral trade talks with India.
The government has already deployed 35 additional employees to main customs offices.
""Along with strengthening customs checking system by setting up Border Outposts with required security personnel, we are also conducting close surveillance in the market and taking smuggled goods from warehouses under our control,"" Sharma said.
Smugglers are reportedly storing smuggled goods in secret warehouses in the vicinity of major border points.
Meanwhile, DoC has deployed six teams to monitor major customs points across the country. ""The three-member teams led by directors of the department monitor regular activities at all major customs,"" said Sharma. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

On Monday, the Constituent Assembly unanimously passed a 'proposal of public interest' presented by Maoist Constituent Assembly member Chandra Prakash Gajurel.
The proposal expressed worry that agitations could harm communal harmony in the country.
Commenting on the proposal, Nepali Congress Constituent Assembly member Laxman Ghimire, MJF's Bijaya Gachhedar and the UML's Pradeep Gyawali emphasised that the parties needed to work together to ward off possible communal discord.
They also expressed support to the proposal tabled by the Maoist party.
Home Minister Krishna Prasad Situala said the government was taking all necessary measures to control the protests and claimed that the situation was fully under control.
On Wednesday, President Dr Ram Baran Yadav, clad in the Nepal costume, had taken the oath of office and secrecy in Nepali. However, when he administered the oath of office to Vice President Jha, who was clad in a dress that many identify with Indian parliamentarians, the latter preferred to take the oath in Hindi.
According to an independent statistics, only 0.05 per cent of people living in Terai speak Hindi. The majority of the people there speak Bhojpuri, Maithali, Avadhi and other local dialects, Nepalnews reported.

    The heads of state or government of the eight-member South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) signed a  declaration at the closing session chaired by Indian Prime  Minister Manmohan Singh.
    Singh said in his closing remarks that the declaration adopted  Wednesday is comprehensive and forward-looking and it gives SAARC  a wider mandate to promote peace and development in the region,  including through greater connectivity - in trade, in the movement of people and through the flow of ideas. 
    The leaders have agreed to operationalize the SAARC Development Fund; establish the South Asian University; create a SAARC Food  Bank; and set up the SAARC Arbitration Council after two-day  discussions.
    ""The cooperation and accommodation that have characterized our  deliberations and negotiations show that our countries are ready  for a transformation of SAARC into an effective instrument of  regional advancement,"" said Singh. India took chairmanship of the  regional grouping from Bangladesh on Tuesday.
    The leaders have agreed to make tangible progress in the next  six months on four issues affecting the people's daily lives:  water (including flood control), energy, food and environment. The SAARC will work with international agencies to develop and  implement viable cross-border regional projects in these four  sectors, which address people's basic needs. 
    The leaders have also decided to designate 2008 as the ""SAARC  Year of Good Governance"", said Singh.
    South Asia faces the challenge of being home to the largest  concentration of poor and illiterate people, said Singh. 
    In order to win decisively the war against poverty, ignorance  and disease, Singh called on South Asian countries to work  together, resolve their differences and to enhance regional  cooperation. 
    ""We must also win the war against all forms of extremism and  intolerance in our region"".
    At the closing ceremony, the foreign ministers of SAARC member  countries signed two agreements on the establishment of the South  Asian University in India and the SAARC Food Bank.      
    SAARC, which was formally established in 1985, now groups  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan  and Sri Lanka.

"599",20032195,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists using ceasefire withdrawal as tactic_ analysts.rtf; Date: August 28, 2003 Thursday; Text: Maoist rebels in Nepal abandoned a ceasefire in fury over the killing of nearly 20 of their cadres by security forces, but are also hopeful their ploy will spur further government concessions, analysts said Thursday.
""This is, on the one hand, a threat by the Maoists to extract more concessions from a government weak in cohesion and lacking legitimacy,"" said Kapil Shrestha, professor of political science at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu and a member of Nepal's human rights commission.
""On the other hand, the action is also aimed at creating a climate of fear and terror among the common people, which is likely to weaken the confidence of the people in the government's capacity to provide security to them.""
The guerrillas announced Wednesday that a ceasefire in place since January 29 and sputtering peace talks had ""no significance"" after the government rejected an ultimatum supporting their key demand of an assembly to redraft the constitution.
A similar ceasefire in 2001 broke down over demands that the kingdom's constitutional monarchy be abolished, triggering a violent phase in the insurgency that left 90 police officers and soldiers dead in just one day.
""We have terminated the peace process, along with the ceasefire and the code of conduct (which governs the truce) for the time being because of the government's undemocratic posture,"" said a statement from Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda (The Fierce).
He did hint that talks could resume ""in the event that people's sovereign rights and basic interests are re-established,"" although he did not elaborate.
Social reform activist and political analyst Bhakatendra Thapa said the window left open by Prachanda for rebels to return to talks meant they were waiting to see what concessions the government would tender.
""The Maoists have not closed the door on future negotiations. This withdrawal is because they want to be sure to their demand of a constituent assembly is fulfilled,"" he said.
A cabinet source said the government had put the proposal of a constituent assembly to King Gyanendra and was awaiting his views on the matter.
Three rounds of peace talks since the ceasefire, the latest coming last week, have failed to galvanise action to end the Maoists' seven-year ""people's war"" that has claimed the lives of more than 7,800 people.
Long-awaited talks broke down completely last week over the issue of the constituent assembly and the Maoists' anger at the military killing of a group of rebels in the eastern Ramechhap district even as talks were underway.
The rebels said 19 of their cadres died in a military attack, while the army maintains its troops were acting in self-defence when they fired on, and killed, 17 Maoists. A three-person government team is investigating.
Talks facilitator Daman Nath Dhungana said he was not surprised by the Maoist withdrawal from the peace process.
""Both the government and the Maoists had been violating the code of conduct,"" he said.
""The Ramechhap incident in fact ruined the talks.""

 The interview given by the king to the Time magazine American weekly has given rise to a new wave in Nepalese politics. The King's interview showed that a constitutional monarch wants to be an active monarch and is challenging the constitution of 1990 the new constitution after the success of the people's movement for democracy in 1990 .
 Through its comments, attempts to place the blame on the political parties had been made. If the political parties have indulged in criminal activities, then only the people who are invested with sovereign rights have the right to take action against them and the time to make this very clear has arrived.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 5 Feb 04
The nation's situation is not as it should be and is deteriorating. The government is not present in the villages. The Maoists are becoming more violent. The government is sitting in a limited area surrounded by barbed wire. Only that political party that represents the people can resolve such a situation. Those comments have even affected the international world negatively .
 For the King to say that for the speedy resolution of the problem should come together is just a hoax. In the presence of the King, I supported Madhav Nepal secretary general of the CPN-UML and Girija Prasad Koirala the president of the Nepali Congress party also immediately gave his support. But, why is it that until now nothing is being started?
 The king is surrounded by a limited circle of regressive elements. And which, just like in the erstwhile Panchayat regime the non-party system that was replaced by multiparty system after 1990 , has an aim to earn huge amount of wealthy through corrupt practices. A constitutional monarch must not listen to what the regressive elements are saying and should not allow them to circle him. This will lead to the king's loss. That is why the king must understand this immediately. It is in the king's hands to not allow such a situation to move forward.

The prime minister, meanwhile, ordered a probe into earlier mob attacks on a mosque, media offices and Middle Eastern and Pakistani airline offices in Nepal's capital.
Tourists trickling into Katmandu were driven to their hotels in buses with armed escorts, and soldiers kept watch as city workers swept broken glass, burnt tires and pieces of broken furniture from the debris-littered streets.
The lockdown on Katmandu also forced the cancellation of Friday prayers at the Jame mosque, which was ransacked on Wednesday after an angry mob received word that the Nepalese hostages had been killed. Troops guarded the mosque, the capital's only Muslim house of worship.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba visited the mosque Friday and ordered an investigation into the attack.
""Those found guilty will be punished,"" Deuba said.
A video posted on a Web site Tuesday showed militants killing the 12 Nepalese workers in Iraq, sparking riots in major cities across Nepal that left two dead.
Information Minister Mohammed Mohsin said the government was using ""appropriate channels to bring back the bodies"" of the Nepalese workers, who disappeared soon after entering Iraq from Jordan on Aug. 19.
Officials have received information that the body of one of the slain hostages was found in Iraq, Foreign Minster Prakash Sharan Mahat later told reporters. He didn't elaborate.
He also said the government has asked the International Red Cross for help in recovering the bodies.
Officials have admitted that they have not been able to establish direct contact with the hostage-takers. Nepal's ambassador to Iraq, Puskar Rajbhandari, said he had appealed to the insurgents through various Arabic television stations to hand over the bodies.
Mahat also urged all Nepalese in Iraq to leave. ""We will do whatever we can do to bring them back,"" he said.
Hundred of Nepalese workers who had been headed for Iraq were stranded in Kuwait after being turned back at the border, Mahat added.
The curfew in Katmandu - accompanied by a warning that violators would be shot on sight - was lifted for 3 1/2 hours Friday morning so people could stock up on food and other supplies. It was also briefly lifted Thursday.
Large crowds gathered on street corners to buy newspapers and meet friends and relatives before they were sent back home 3 1/2 hours later.
Most outgoing domestic flights were canceled, said airport official Keshav Khanal. Pakistan International Airlines, Qatar Airways, India's Jet Airlines, Gulf Airways and Bangladesh's Biman Airlines canceled internationals flights, he said.
Iraqi militants have taken more than 100 foreigners hostage in recent months.
Nepal, which has no troops in Iraq, has long banned its citizens from working there because of security concerns. However, many people from the poor Himalayan nation take jobs abroad and 17,000 Nepalese are believed to have slipped into Iraq - many working as armed security guards for foreign contractors.

Kathmandu, [Tuesday] 8 May: The US embassy Tuesday warned its citizens to exercise caution before visiting Nepal, citing continued Maoists ""violence, extortion and abduction"" even after their entry into the interim government.
The embassy has said that it is concerned about the security situation in Nepal and urged American citizens planning a visit to Nepal to obtain updated security information before they travel.
Issuing a travel advisory on Monday, the embassy urged its citizens who are presently in Nepal to be careful and not to leave their houses if there are demonstrations being held.
""Despite the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement by the government and Maoist insurgents and their entry into an interim government, Maoists continue to engage in violence, extortion, and abductions,"" the US embassy advisory read, adding: 
""Maoists freely roam the countryside and cities, sometimes openly bearing their weapons. The Young Communist League, a subgroup of the Maoists, continues to extort and abuse people, including threatening Kathmandu-based personnel of a US non- governmental organization.""
""Given the nature, intensity and unpredictability of disturbances, American citizens are urged to exercise special caution during times when demonstrations are announced, avoid areas where demonstrations are occurring or crowds are forming, avoid road travel, and maintain a low profile,"" the release further said.
The US is yet to remove their terrorist tag on the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).

Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
Mumbai, 5 January: Describing Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed as ""co-conspirators"" in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam on Wednesday [5 January] told the Bombay High Court in the Indian state of Maharashtra that the trial court had erred in acquitting the duo by giving them the benefit of doubt. 
Nikam cited 21 circumstances to establish how Faheem and Sabauddin were closely associated with LeT [Lashkar-i-Toiba] leaders Abu Kafa and Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi, and had acted on their instructions to help carry out the terror attacks. 
Nikam said that both had prepared maps of target locations in Mumbai and passed them on to LeT in Pakistan which gave them to the 26/11 attackers. 
Faheem had obtained a Pakistani passport on 1 November, 2007 using forged documents. The passport was seized from him after his arrest in Uttar Pradesh, the northern state of India, in another case on 10 February, 2008, Nikam said. The passport carried Faheem's photo and entries showed that he left Karachi on 15 November 2007, and arrived in Kathmandu in Nepal on the same day. The Pakistani government had confirmed that he had stayed in that country, Nikam said. 
Soon thereafter Faheem visited Mumbai in December 2007 and sought admission in a computer institute under a fictitious name of Sahil Pawaskar. He stayed under the same name in a rented house in South Mumbai where targets of 26/11 attack were located, although he owns a house in a Mumbai suburb where his family lives, the prosecutor argued. 
Faheem stayed in Mumbai till 3 January, 2008, and again went to Nepal. Between 4 January 2008 and 1 February, 2008, Naruddin Shaikh, a close of friend of Faheem, met him in Kathmandu and saw Faheem giving maps of Mumbai targets to Sabauddin, said Nikam. 
Nikam further pointed out that one of these maps was found in the pocket of slain terrorist Abu Ismael who was killed during the terror attack. 
Justices Ranjana Desai and R.V. More then asked why the map found in Ismael's pocket did not bear blood stains or wrinkles in that case. 
The prosecutor said that Ismael had suffered bullet injuries in the left portion of the body while the map was found in his right side pocket. Nikam however conceded that although there were blood stains on corners of right pocket the blood drops had not percolated inside. 
Explaining the absence of wrinkles on the map, Nikam said it was illogical to expect this. However, one can expect marks of folds on the map. Wrinkles can appear only when the map is spoilt or crumpled by the one carrying it, he argued. 
In this case, the map had folds but not wrinkles, he pointed out. To prove his point, Nikam demonstrated by folding two pieces of paper and putting them in his pocket. The court was shown that they bore marks of folds but not wrinkles. Nikam argued that the trial court had failed to ask Faheem to explain how his photographs and handwriting appeared on the admission papers of computer institute under the fictitious name. Faheem had neither denied nor admitted this.

"5864",2007809,"Title: Prachanda under fire from his men.rtf; Date: August 5, 2007 Sunday 3:36 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 5 -- They were comrades in arms. Minus the arms, the Maoists in Nepal are a divided lot now. Within months of taking off as a mainstream democratic party, the Maoists are fast emerging as a factionalised political group. A faction of Maoist cadres turned against Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai and charged them of betraying the revolution, and compromising with regressive and feudal forces for cheap political gains.
  Led by Laxman Tharu, the Maoist Joint Rebel Front (MJRF) is the new platform for the Maoist forces opposing the Maoists leaders and their policies. And more and more cadres are likely to join the dissident group. ""If they continue to follow the reformist line by disrupting the revolution, we will pull out the Peoples Liberation Army along with the arms,"" Tharu, who is also the general secretary of the Tharuwan Mukti Morcha, a wing of Nepal's Maoist, said. Claiming that several Maoist central committee members, including Rabindra Shrestha and Mani Thapa are also part of the new Front, Tharu claimed more than 4,000 Maoist cadres have already joined them.
  The Maoists are now finding it difficult to hold the cadres during the run up to the November 22 elections to the Constituent Assembly. It has been reported that more than 1,000 cadres left the Maoist cantonment in Nawalparasi recently and are keen to join the MJRF. Totally amateur in electoral politics, revolts and large exodus may be risky for the Maoists. A lot of cadres of Tharuwan Mukti Morcha (TMM) and Madhesi Mukti Morcha (MMM) have already deserted the organisations.
  A large number of MMM cadres have joined the Maoists offshoot, Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) factions led by Jwala Singh and Jaya Krishna Goit.
  Like TMM, the MMM is the Madheshi wing of Nepal's Maoist. The problem turned out to be more serious as Tharu has asked the party to quit the government by September 1 and dismantle all the embankments built along the Nepal-India border to save Nepal's Terai from floods every year.
  Several leaders have been training guns at New Delhi for the flash flood in Nepal's Terai region last month, and are now trying to turn the allegation as a major political issue for the coming elections. However, none of the Maoists leaders were ready to make any statement on Tharu's allegation. The Maoist spokesman and Nepal's Information Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara was not available for comments.

"754",20031248,"Title: British begin rapid buildup in advance of possible war in Iraq(3).rtf; Date: February 28, 2003, Friday, BC cycle; Text: A month ago, the British area of Camp Fox was nothing but a pristine patch of golden sand in the Kuwaiti desert. By Friday, it had become a bustling base, filled with tents, flatbed trucks and supplies for British fighters.
Unlike American troops, many of whom have been here for months, British forces only began arriving in Kuwait a few weeks ago and have had to hustle to get themselves ready for a possible war in Iraq.
Most of the 18,000 to 20,000 British troops here arrived in the past two weeks. At least 6,000 more are expected in the coming days.
""If you compare us as a force to the last Gulf War, then we've moved twice as much in half the time,"" said Lt. Col. Debbie Noble, a British military spokeswoman. ""There's more of a sense of urgency with this one because we have come in late in the day.""
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have threatened to invade Iraq because they feel Saddam has not fully cooperated with U.N. inspectors trying to verify disarmament. The two allies, joined by Spain, have sponsored a U.N. resolution that would open the door to military action.
A quarter of the British army and its biggest naval task force in 20 years is building up in the region. The Royal Air Force also has ordered 100 planes and 27 helicopters.
Because the British arrived so rapidly, they were forced to rely on U.S. troops already here for help.
British soldiers at Camp Fox ate U.S. military rations when they first arrived. And U.S. Marines helped them with security, gave them hot showers and extra supplies.
""They've got the infrastructure in place and we've been able to blister on to it,"" Noble said. ""We came in so late in the day that we had no choice.""
British and U.S. Marines are running drills together in the desert to familiarize themselves with each others' weapons and vehicles. British Marines also planned to practice running into and out of U.S. helicopters, just in case they need a lift during a battle.
""This will give us the opportunity to work with each other,"" said Capt. Jay Delarosa, a U.S. Marine spokesman.
The British base at Camp Fox is responsible for supplying nearly all the arriving British troops.
Using electronic scanners, members of the 6th Supply Regiment Royal Logistics Corp., whose motto is ""Supply or Die,"" log in tons of supplies arriving in huge shipping containers, everything from replacement tank engines to medical supplies.
""You can't just move a whole force and drop them on the ground and expect them to be ready to fight,"" said Lt. Dave Barlow, 24, of Birmingham, England.
In one part of the camp, engineers used flatbed trucks and machinery to lift shipping containers and have begun filling up a storage area that could eventually hold 10,000 tons of ammunition.
In another area, Nepalese Gurkha engineers cut the lumber that will be used to make an outhouse.
The vast desert field beyond the camp will soon be covered with hundreds of shipping containers acting as storage closets for British supplies that can be rapidly moved to soldiers at the front.
""It does seem like we're playing catch up,"" said Maj. Chris Davis, the camp commandant. ""We're now reaching the stage where we've probably come up to readiness.""

Kathmandu, 13 November: Arun Chand, son of former Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, has said that apart from agreeing to pay money owed to sugarcane farmers, he had no other agreement with the Maoists. 
Chand, who was freed after 13 days of abduction by Maoists, said that the Maoists did not demand any ransom.

The vast majority of the 205 lawmakers in the sacked lower house met for three hours on a wet exhibition ground in Kathmandu along with nearly 2,000 supporters, witnesses said.
Royally-appointed Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa has called for November elections -- which would be the first since King Gyanendra dismissed the elected government in October 2002 for ""incompetence"".
But Madhav Kumar Nepal, the consensus candidate for prime minister among the five major parties, said such polls would be engineered to bring the king's supporters to power.
""The king's proposed election will never be free and fair,"" said Nepal, whose Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist was the main opposition in the last parliament.
Former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who heads the largest party, the Nepali Congress, said the king's 2002 intervention had weakened support for the monarchy -- which is also opposed by Maoist rebels who control vast parts of the kingdom.
""It will now be up to the younger generation whether the kingship should continue,"" Koirala said.

"7446",20117560,"Title: Satellite landed, exact site not yet known_ NASA.rtf; Date: September 24, 2011 Saturday; Text: Nepal, Sept. 24 -- (Update II)
WASHINGTON, Sept 24: A decommissioned NASA satellite, the biggest piece of US space junk to fall in 30 years, has crash-landed but the precise location is not yet known, the US space agency said early Saturday.
NASA has repeatedly said there is only a ""very remote"" risk to the public from the 26 fragments of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which were expected to survive the fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.
The satellite fell back to Earth between 11:23 pm Friday and 1:09 am Saturday (0323-0509 GMT Saturday), but the precise re-entry time and location ""are not yet known with certainty,"" NASA said.
""The Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California said the satellite penetrated the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean,"" it later said, noting the landing site was still not confirmed.
On its Twitter feed, NASA said, ""If debris fell on land (and that's still a BIG if), Canada is most likely area.""
The two dozen parts of the UARS that may have survived re-entry could weigh anything from two to 350 pounds (1-158 kilograms), the space agency said, and the debris field is expected to span 500 miles (800 kilometers).
Earlier, Canada, Africa and Australia had all been named as possible sites for touchdown of debris from the tour-bus-sized UARS.
The tumbling motion of the satellite has made it difficult to narrow down the location. And given that the world is 70 percent water, an ocean landing was considered likely.
""In the entire 50 plus year history of the space program, no person has ever been injured by a piece of re-entering space debris,"" said Mark Matney, an orbital debris scientist at NASA.
""Keep in mind we have bits of debris re-entering the atmosphere every single day.""
(Photo: AP)
On Friday, a NASA spokeswoman said the US Department of Defense and the space agency were busy tracking the debris and keeping all federal disaster agencies informed.
The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice Thursday to pilots and flight crews of the potential hazard, and urged them to report any falling space debris and take note of its position and time.
On Friday, Italy's civil protection agency warned that the probability of a crash in its northern territory had risen from 0.6 to 1.5 percent, and urged residents to stay indoors, on lower floors, preferably near load-bearing walls.
Orbital debris experts say space junk of this size from broken-down satellites and spent rockets tends to fall back to Earth about once a year, though this is the biggest NASA satellite to fall in three decades.
NASA's 85-ton Skylab crashed into western Australia in 1979.
The surviving chunks of the UARS, which launched in 1991 and was decommissioned in 2005, will likely include titanium fuel tanks, beryllium housing and stainless steel batteries and wheel rims.
""No consideration ever was given to shooting it down,"" NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey said.
The craft contains no fuel and so is not expected to explode on impact, and NASA also said on Twitter that talk of ""flaming space debris"" was a ""myth.""
""Pieces of UARS landing on Earth will not be very hot. Heating stops 20 miles up, cools after that,"" NASA said, adding that UARS contains nothing radioactive but its metal fragments could be sharp.
The US space agency has warned anyone who comes across what they believe may be UARS debris not to touch it but to contact authorities for assistance.
Space law professor Frans von der Dunk from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln told AFP that the United States will likely have to pay damages to any country where the debris falls.
""The damage to be compensated is essentially without limit,"" von der Dunk said, referring to the 1972 Liability Convention to which the United States is one of 80 state signatories.

 Yonjan said that displaced people were pouring in here in the hope that it is a safe place for them. ""The Maoists have been unable to attack the shelter after the disciples of Kirat religion handed over some of the influential Maoist workers to the administration after successfully retaliating their assault in the past,"" he said.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website
(Changing text of item) 
Bardiya [northwest Nepal, along India border], 15 June [Sunday]: Of the 42 posts at Bardiya Customs Office, 30 posts are still vacant. The office is run by only 12 staff for long. 
According to Ram Prasad Kafle, an official at the office, the posts are vacant after most of the staff got transferred elsewhere during the insurgency and no replacements came. 
Due to the limited number of staff, the office has not been able to control smuggling and trafficking of illegal items, resulting in the soaring of such activities. 
Meanwhile, the customs offices at Ganeshpur, Kalabanjar, Taratal, Khairapur, Dhodhari, Kothiyaghat and Ishworigunj, which were shifted to Gulariya [in Bardiya] during insurgency, have not been reinstated yet. Only three customs offices are operating in the district at present. 
""Taking advantage of this situation, items worth thousands of rupees are being smuggled into the district on a daily basis,"" said Dan Singh Gurung, a local at Jamuni VDC [village committee]. 
Police periodically confiscate tons of smuggled cement and chemical fertilizer in the district. However, due to lack of customs offices and office bearers, smuggling is on an upward trend in the district. Locals have demanded that government mobilize armed police force in the district to contain the burgeoning incidents of smuggling and illegal trade going unchecked.

Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 6 February
Normal life in the capital has been affected on Monday [6 February] as well, the second day of the seven-day long Nepal bandh (general strike) called by the Maoists to disrupt the municipal polls.
Like in the first day of bandh, shops in interior parts of the city are open; shops in major thoroughfares remained closed. Most of the public and private vehicles kept off the roads but two wheelers and mini-vans could be seen plying around the streets.
The first day of bandh affected normal life across the country on Sunday.
The bandh however passed off largely peaceful on Sunday though security forces diffused bombs at Balkhu, Chabbhil and in front of the Tri-Chandra military hospital.
Educational institutions, major commercial establishments, private offices and shops in major hubs of the capital remained closed. However, shops and offices in the bylanes were open.
More vehicles were seen plying than on previous bandhs as heavy security arrangement have been made to thwart the bandh.
Some taxi drivers, however, said that they worked Sunday to earn more money. ""I always ply my vehicle during strikes because I charge more money on such days,"" said Bharat Thapa Magar, of Dhading. Buses belonging to Nepal Yatayat, Kantipur Yatayat, a few micro-buses, tempos and Tata mobile vans were running.
Meanwhile, public life was crippled throughout the nation on the first day of a week-long general strike called by the Maoists. There was scant vehicular movement on roads across Pokhara and most shops, barring some tea stalls, remained closed. Most academic institutions also remained closed. A few vehicles were seen plying, that too under the protection of the security forces. Additional security personnel were deployed in Pokhara, according to reports.
In Chitwan, normal life was brought to a standstill due to the bandh. Only bicycles and rickshaws could be seen plying on the roads while academic and business institutions remained closed.
A report from Bara said most of the shops, local industries and academic institutions in the district remained closed and only a few government personnel attended office. The first day of the bandh crippled normal life in Rautahat too.
A report from Rupandehi said the bandh affected normal life in the district. Though the local administration had urged people to go about their business as usual, most shops remained closed.
According to reports from Sarlahi, most business and academic establishments remained closed. Police personnel were deployed to open shops in Malangwa bazaar Sunday morning, but the shop owners demurred. The Maoists placed obstacles on the Lalbandi section of the Mahendra Highway.
Police forcibly opened the main business centres in Dhading district, including in Dhadingbeshi, the district headquarters. Most of the business institutions remained shut and the streets were deserted. Ambulances were plying on the Tribhuvan and Prithvi highways under the escort of security forces.
A report from Birgunj said most sectors were affected by the bandh. Unified security forces were deployed at the main chowks of the city Sunday morning. Security forces were running some vehicles under their control.
In Janakpurdham, a few motorbikes could be seen plying, but most private enterprises remained closed. The government-run Janakpur Cigarette Factory and Janakpur-Jayanagar Rail service were open for operation.
A report from Pyuthan said all social sectors in the district remained closed. The Maoists staged torch rallies at Bijaynagar, Bijuwar and Dharmawati, among other places, reports quoted locals as saying.
In Tanahun, most educational institutions remained closed while few people could be seen in government offices.
The Maoists obstructed the Mahendra highway's Belbari to Kakarvitta section. Traffic came to a halt and all shops, industrial houses, educational institutes remained shut. The bomb disposal team dispatched from the RNA's eastern divisional headquarters deactivated the bombs laid out by Maoists at Jirikhimti in Morang, said the RNA's eastern divisional headquarters.
A report from Phidim said the local administration used security personnel to open some of the shops in Phidim, yet educational institutes and factories remained shut.
A report from Dhankuta said the bandh affected life there in a big way. Sunsari district was also affected by the bandh, as was Bhairahawa. The bandh also affected normal life in Biratnagar, Gorkha, Syangja, Baglung, Myagdi, Parbat, Dolakha, Rajbiraj and Kanchanpur.
Meanwhile the government decided to give extra 20 per cent on insurance amount owners of damaged vehicles are entitled to. Owners of those sans insurance will get proper compensation.

Civil Aviation Minister Pradeep Gyawali cited a preliminary report by investigators as saying the helicopter was flying too low for the weather and the terrain.
The Russian-built MI-17 helicopter chartered by the World Wildlife Fund crashed in mountains 250 miles east of Katmandu on Sept. 23. It was foggy and raining at the time.
Among those killed were Nepalese Forest Minister Gopal Rai, Finnish Embassy Charge d'Affaires Pauli Mustonen and USAID Deputy Director in Nepal Margaret Alexander.
WWF said seven of its employees were among the victims, including four Nepalis, an Australian, a Canadian and an American. The victims also included Nepali journalists, government officials and four crew members two Russians and two Nepalis.
A full report on the investigation into the crash was expected in a few weeks.
The wreckage was found only two days after the crash, and the difficult terrain hindered recovery operations.
The passengers had visited a WWF project in the region and were headed for a village a 20-minute flight away.

"1764",20043872,"Title: Jordan pledges to help France over hostage crisis.rtf; Date: August 31, 2004 Tuesday 7:12 PM GMT; Text: Jordan pledged Tuesday to help France secure the release of two journalists held hostage in Iraq, who are facing the imminent expiry of an ultimatum by their Islamic kidnappers.
King Abdullah II told visiting French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier his country would step up its efforts and contacts in Iraq to help save newsmen Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot.
His comments came as an Al-Qaeda-linked Sunni Muslim militant group in Iraq announced on its website the execution of 12 Nepalese hostages.
""Jordan will step up its efforts and its contacts with the concerned Iraqi parties to help guarantee the release of the French journalists abducted in Iraq,"" state-run Petra news agency quoted the king as telling Barnier.
The monarch added his voice to widespread international condemnation of the kidnapping, saying ""it reflects the violation, by some, of morals, values of goodness and justice, which are the basis of Islam"".
Barnier, on an emergency mission to save the two men, earlier agreed with Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Moasher on a ""mechanism"" to coordinate their efforts.
Moasher told reporters Jordan initiated conctacts with Iraqi groups and organisations to help solve the hostage crisis.
""We already started these contacts through the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.
""We have agreed to coordinate these issues with the French embassy hopefully until the release of these hostages,"" Moasher said. ""There is not much time but I hope we will obtain positive results.""
Jordan has ""developed contacts with many people and organisations that have contacts with some of these groups"" following the abduction of several of its nationals in recent months, Moasher said.
Thanks to these contacts, Amman was able to secure the release of eight Jordanians kidnapped in July and August.
Barnier later headed back to Egypt for separate talks with German counterpart Joschka Fischer, who is on a regional tour, and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei.
It was unclear where he would head next, although an Arab diplomat said Barnier was scheduled to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak early Wednesday in the Mediterraean port city of Alexandria.
A Mubarak spokesman said Egypt would ""use all of its contacts with tribal and religious leaders in Iraq to secure the release of the two Frenchmen as well as Egyptian hostage Mohamed Ali Sanad"".
Barnier visited Egypt Monday and spoke with Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Soleiman before moving on to Jordan as he fiercely campaigned for the two newsmen's release.
Chesnot and Malbrunot went missing in Iraq on August 20.
Their kidnappers, a Sunni Muslim group calling itself the Islamic Army of Iraq, gave France a 48-hour ultimatum to revoke a controversial law banning Islamic headscarves from state schools but have extended its ultimatum by 24 hours to Tuesday night.
""Failure to revoke it might cost us our lives. It's a question of time -- maybe minutes -- before we are among the dead,"" Chesnot said in a video broadcast on Al-Jazeera television Monday evening.
Barnier's mission to Amman came as French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin prepared to preside over a ministerial crisis meeting in Paris and President Jacques Chirac, on a visit to Russia, renewed an appeal for the release of the newsmen.
France, one of the most vocal opponents of the US-led war in Iraq, has refused to yield to the kidnappers' demands to budge on its decision to impose from Thursday a ban on ostentatious religious insignia in state schools.
It has won strong support from Muslim leaders across the world and its own five million strong Muslim community, which condemned the abduction as un-Islamic and stressed it should not be linked to the French law.

"5868",2007965,"Title: Made in Myanmar.rtf; Date: September 28, 2007 Friday 4:21 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Sept. 28 -- The images are indelible - thousands of red- robed monks, bare-footed and bold, quietly standing up to the armed might of riot policemen and tanks. And then the even starker photograph of a Japanese journalist continuing to film protestors on the run from military guns, even as soldiers pump him with bullets.
  One look at these pictures and you know you are watching history in the making. Somehow, their rawness and naked honesty make India's silence on Myanmar seem both loud and brutal. You wonder how the world's largest democracy can be so numb and unmoved. Foreign policy wonks will dismiss the outrage as the sentimental hand-wringing of the liberal elite. We will be told about the several strategic imperatives that drive our relationship with the military junta. And arguably, at a certain time in history, India probably had no other option than to do brisk business with the generals of Yangon.
  Aung San Suu Kyi, who went to college in Delhi, was admired and loved, but it was clear that the struggle for democracy was losing steam. China, which had supplied arms and knowhow to Myanmar's military, had begun to upgrade ports and facilities dangerously close to India. Military alarmists were warning that Indian armies had once marched into China down the Burma Road. How was India so sure that the reverse journey southwards was not a possibility? And under the new regime, a country that had been a historical haven for Naga militants, was now ready to close down training camps and forest hideouts.
  Besides, India shares a 1,700 km long border with Myanmar. Realistically, how long could we not talk to another government based on a moral principle? So, painful as it, let's agree that government policies are invariably imbued with pragmatism and cannot afford the purity of ideologues. And let's rephrase the question - as every global leader of worth condemns the military atrocities in Myanmar, is India's decision to remain a mute spectator an intelligent, well thought-out policy? Or is the government in danger of misreading the public mood and batting on the wrong side of change?
  Poignant and disturbing as the underground stories of the Burmese people are, this cannot only be an academic debate about democracy.In fact, democracy has for long been an excuse used by powerful nations to push their armies into countries where they don't belong. There's no better example of that than the ill-fangled American invasion of Iraq. In the name of democracy, President George W. Bush has slapped new sanctions against Myanmar's military government, accusing the regime of enforcing a ""19-year reign of fear"". But his passionate outburst against autocracies and oligarchies was interestingly silent on Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt - all close American allies, all a huge distance from democracy.
  Despite the fact that a popular political movement has clearly taken root in Pakistan, Washington's strategic interests have defined a stubbornly supportive policy when it comes to President Pervez Musharraf. This, even as every major American newspaper and commentator of consequence is warning against the Bush administration's blind faith in a regime that has an expiry date stamped across it.
  Closer home, we may like to boast that our democracy is what elevates us above the grandiose power of China, but the fact is that India's official relationship with democracy has been full of ambivalence and contradictions. Take Pakistan again - despite all our suspicions and misgivings, and despite Kargil, the Indian establishment and many ordinary Indians were quite willing to be charmed by the smooth-talking General.
  On my many visits to Pakistan - and this was well before the upheaval - I was always confronted with the same question: why were Indians so taken in by a dictatorial regime? But we genuinely believed that President Musharraf was moderate, tough, innovative about the peace process and, ultimately, our best bet. The dialogue with Pakistan may have broken down a million times but our problem with the General was never that he came into power through an army coup.
  It's not as if we believed that the 'democratically' elected leaders who had been pushed into exile were necessarily 'better' for India. The Pakistan Supreme Court's decision on Friday to allow him to contest in uniform means a huge setback for the political uprising against him.But even so, India's enthusiasm for his government has been inevitably diminished by the popular mood in Pakistan. We are suddenly looking at Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto with fresh eyes. This is because there comes a time in the history of nations that propels them to the precipice of dramatic change. And other countries, especially those which see themselves as regional leaders, must respond accordingly.
  It's the same principle that we must apply to the military crackdown in Myanmar so that we don't repeat the mistake we almost made in Nepal. Ind"

Not too many people know that corruption is taking place but the reality is that in an autocratic system, those holding high positions are the most corrupt.
 [Devi Prasad Ojha] There is a growing market for peace, human rights and corruption control. But there is tremendous corruption within these markets. There is conflict within people and organizations that are advocating for peace. People who advocate for human rights are the one who are abusing human rights and perpetrating violations. And those who are raising voices against corruption saying there will be transparency in corruption control are the one who do not show accountability and transparency.

  Karat, a friend of Bhattarai during their days in JNU, has denied having met the Nepalese leader, who carries a red-corner Interpol notice.

"2770",20043942,"Title: Nepal king gives police sweeping powers as protests thwarted near palace.rtf; Date: April 10, 2004 Saturday; Text: King Gyanendra of Nepal on Saturday gave security forces sweeping powers of arrest, as riot police rounded up hundreds more pro-democracy protesters outside his palace, officials said.
State radio said the king renewed an ordinance that gives police and troops the right to detain people and search homes on suspicion of ""terrorist"" activities.
The ordinance had just expired after being imposed by parliament for two years in April 2002. King Gyanendra, who dismissed the elected government six months later, extended it in the absence of a parliament.
The measure was designed to help troops battle Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy.
But its renewal comes after a week of massive demonstrations in Kathmandu demanding the restoration of democracy. The protests are sponsored by the main parties in the dissolved parliament, which are not linked to the Maoists.
At least 1,500 protesters gathered Saturday in a park outside the palace but were promptly rounded up by police enforcing a two-day-old ban on public gatherings in the capital, witnesses said.
On a nearby street, police baton-charged demonstrators who lobbed stones. A police officer was seen with blood on his head after he was hit by a stone.
Tens of thousands had rallied Friday outside the palace but their threats to cross the barbed-wire barricades and storm the sprawling palace compound were thwarted when police detained them en masse.
""Most of the protesters have been released soon after Friday's events but nearly 1,600 of them remain in custody,"" a police officer said on condition of anonymity before the latest detentions.
Opposition parties charged that the government did not supply food, water or beds for the detained protesters who spent the night crammed in three public buildings.
Some of the protesters were being kept at the national food warehouse, which is used each autumn to store Tibetan goats awaiting slaughter for the Hindu kingdom's Durga Puja festival.
""This is the height of cruelty. They're being housed on the city's outskirts and those who are elderly or sick have had to walk back to their homes after being released,"" said Arjun Narsingh K.C., spokesman for the opposition Nepali Congress party.
Opposition leaders played down their failure to make good on threats to storm the palace, saying they already defied the ban on public assembly.
The government indefinitely banned demonstrations Thursday saying the rallies would be infiltrated by the Maoists, who have offered moral support to the protests in Kathmandu.
But the Maoists also have a tense relationship with the parties dating from the crackdowns launched on them by democratically elected governments.
The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the opposition's consensus prime ministerial candidate, said one of its activists, Tara Chandra Regmi, was killed by Maoists Friday in the northwestern Bajura district.
Madhav Kumar Nepal, meeting a delegation of rights activists from Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India and Thailand, said: ""Our fight is directly with the king.""
""We are fighting to restore sovereignty to the people and we will fight for this until we succeed,"" Nepal said.
Elsewhere, police clashed with opposition supporters who torched a statue of King Mahendra, the current king's late father, in the southwestern town of Butwal, a police officer said. He did not know if there were injuries.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 30 August
 Nepali Congress is headed to pass the political proposal in its general convention starting Tuesday [30 August] which will make it a democratic party without recognition to the monarchy.
 With the endorsement of the new policy by the 11th general convention, the party will make a historic leap forward.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 30 Aug 05Nepali Congress has, since its founding, recognized the constitutional monarchy.
 The party has approved the new policy based on the inputs from the new generation.
 The civil society and Nepali Congress have headed towards inclusive democracy since the king took over the executive powers on 1 February. The party has fought for democracy for the last half century and has received overwhelming support of the people. On this account, the party has the big responsibility to give a fresh direction to the country.
 The party is at test whether it gets entangled in democratic jargons or works to restore inclusive democracy. The party should consider how handy the new party policy will prove to be to solve the Maoists conflict. Political parties are the base of governments. It is natural that the general convention of Nepali Congress had drawn the attention of the conscious citizens. Internal democracy, however, is still lacking within Nepali Congress. The party had to suffer divisions due to prevalence of intolerant attitude and the absence of adequate skills for conflict management. The party should start fresh moves for reunification after the general convention. Divided Congress will remain weak and be unable to propel the movement forward. [Passage omitted]

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal agreed to discharge 2,975 minors, who have been living with thousands of other former combatants in U.N.-monitored camps since a 2006 cease-fire, said Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for children and armed conflict.
The former child soldiers will be given vocational and educational training to help them reintegrate into society, and attempts will be made to trace their families and reunite them, Coomaraswamy said. He added that the process is expected to be completed by February.
The former rebels, formally known as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), gave up their armed rebellion in 2006 and joined a peace process. They contested May 2008 elections for the country's lawmaking Constituent Assembly and emerged as the largest political party.
Their leader is now the prime minister of a coalition government that was set up in August.
During their 10 years of fighting government troops, the Maoists were repeatedly accused of recruiting minors to join their ranks. They initially denied the accusations, but U.N. arms monitors identified 2,975 minors among the thousands of former rebel combatants living in the camps.
Most older former combatants are expected to join the country's security forces, but the process has been delayed by the main opposition party, Nepali Congress, which opposes the plan.
Separately, a former rebel group in Sri Lanka also agreed this week to stop child conscription and release more than 60 underage combatants, the U.N. said Thursday.
The Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal militia pledged to free all child combatants within three months and reintegrate them into society, UNICEF said. Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels have also been accused of recruiting child soldiers.

 Kathmandu, 18 August: The government has directed the operators of the Hotel Soaltee Crowne Plaza, a reputed five-star hotel, which has remained closed for the past two days due to Maoist threat, to immediately resume operations. The government issued the directives to the hotel management after holding discussions with the chief of diplomatic missions in Kathmandu and chief of security bodies Wednesday 18 August .

"2842",20044403,"Title: Nepal seeks help India 's help tackling Maoist revolt.rtf; Date: September 9, 2004 Thursday 8:39 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's premier said Thursday he would seek more help from neighbouring India to crush a Maoist revolt wracking his homeland as he began talks with senior Indian leaders in New Delhi.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's five-day official visit came amid an upsurge of violence in Nepal as Maoist rebels step up efforts to overthrow the monarchy and impose communist rule in the impoverished nation.
Deuba, 59, said the eight-year insurgency would top his agenda in talks Thursday with Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.
""Understanding, cooperation and assistance from India have a critical bearing on Nepal's fight against terrorism,"" Deuba said before meeting Singh.
""To deal with this challenge, we have to enhance our capability, and India's assistance in this regard has been important,"" said the premier, who arrived late Wednesday accompanied by a 66-member entourage.
India, along with the United States and Britain, has been a vital backer of Nepal in its drive to quell the insurgency that has cost at least 10,000 lives.
New Delhi has a vital stake in helping quell the revolt as it fears Maoist violence could spill into parts of India where ultra-leftist groups are powerful.
An Indian foreign ministry official, who asked to remain anonymous, said Nepal was seeking extra surveillance helicopters and armored vehicles to help it tackle the uprising in the Himalayan kingdom sandwiched between India and China.
India already supplies weapons, military equipment and training to Nepal's ill-equipped security forces.
The countries were also expected to discuss stepping up patrols along their porous 1,600-kilometer- (990-mile) long border to stop the movement of guerrillas and arms across the frontier.
""The visit would provide an opportunity to comprehensively review, at the highest level, the entire gamut of India-Nepal bilateral relations including issues relating to trade, water resources, defence and security and border management,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement.
Security remained tight on flights between India and Nepal following intelligence reports earlier this week that Maoist rebels could try to hijack an Indian aircraft to spotlight their cause, airport officials said.
Deuba was slated to meet a slew of leaders including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Defence Minister P. Mukharji and Home Minister Shivraj Patil.
The two countries signed accords Thursday on cooperation in culture and sports as well as weather forecasting. More agreements were due to be signed later, including an energy transport deal.
Nepal draws most of its foreign investment from India and Deuba was due to try to reassure Indian businessmen their investments in Nepal would be safe.
As part of their latest tactics to oust the monarchy, the Maoists vowed to force the closure of 35 companies, including some Indian-run firms, by Friday on top of 12 they shut last month.
The Maoists, who already control vast areas of countryside, last month staged a week-long blockade of the capital Kathmandu that they enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.

A rebel leader defended the abduction of an estimated 1,400 students and teachers over the past week from four war-torn districts, saying the hostages were being readied for battle.
""The Maoists have been giving armed combat training and revolutionary education to the abductees to absorb them in the (rebel) army before the Maoists launch a nationwide attack,"" Bam Dev Kshetri, a Maoist central committee member, told AFP.
Kshetri declined to give details of the attack. The Maoists are known for massive nighttime raids on isolated police posts in their bid to wrest the Himalayan kingdom's countryside from government control.
Attacks have been relatively infrequent in Kathmandu, where the rebels have focused on planting small bombs in government buildings and assassinating officials.
But on Sunday, a bomb tore through a bus in the capital outside the head office of state-run Royal Nepal Airlines, scattering shattered glass and metal across a busy street.
A police official said one civilian was killed and 25 other passengers injured, including a policeman and a soldier. A doctor treating the wounded said four were in serious condition.
The police official, who did not want to be named, said three suspected Maoists ran out onto the street shouting to passengers that a bomb had been planted on the blue Indian-built bus.
""The driver helped everyone come out quickly. But nothing went off and people thought it was all a hoax and started boarding again. Then the bomb exploded,"" the official said.
The bus, whose front half was gutted by the blast, had been headed to western Nepal, which has seen most of the bloodshed during the eight-year Maoist rebellion.
Police said the largest-scale kidnappings in the past week were in the western Jajarkot district, where the rebels snatched at least 500 students and 300 teachers from 270 schools.
Suomi Sakai, the resident representative in Nepal of the UN children's agency UNICEF, appealed to the Maoists to release the hostages.
""To ensure schools as zones of peace, disruptive activities should not take place within 500 metres from its area,"" he said in a statement.
Leading Nepalese human rights activist Subodh Pyakurel estimated that more than 12,000 students and teachers have been abducted and released since the rebels ended a ceasefire in August.
""The Maoists provide them with revolutionary education for periods of 10 days to two weeks,"" said Pyakurel, president of the independent rights group Informal Sector Service Centre.
The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.
Observers say the Maoists seem intent on exploiting a power vacuum since the resignation on May 7 of prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a royalist handpicked by King Gyanendra, who faced weeks of angry demonstrations by opposition parties.
The king, who sacked the elected government in 2002, has opened a dialogue with the opposition on picking a new prime minister. But no breakthrough has been reached and dozens of slogan-chanting opposition activists rallied again Sunday outside the royal palace.
Amid the chaos, the Maoists have called an increasing number of strikes, including a three-day nationwide shutdown set to begin June 10.

Addressing the gathering of estimated 80,000 people, Maoist leader Prachanda warned of conspiracies to disrupt the peace process to end the conflict and crucial elections later this year.
""There are reactionary forces trying to sabotage the elections,"" Prachanda, who real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said in a public address in the capital, Katmandu.
If elections are delayed, Prachanda said it would be up to the people to revolt.
The rally was to pressure the government to speed up the delayed peace process that ended their rebellion, including the rapid formation of an interim government that is to include Maoists.
Maoists have complained of the government's slow speed in carrying out the peace process and has accused it of intentionally delaying the formation of the interim government.
The rebels signed a peace accord last year ending the conflict, in which more than 13,000 people were killed.
They joined an interim Parliament in January and are to be part of an interim government that is to conduct elections later this year.
Rebel supporters traveled from villages and towns near Katmandu to attend Tuesday's rally, which began from 11 different points on the outskirts of the capital.
Traffic police issued a notice prohibiting all large vehicles, including buses and vans, from the city because of the expected large crowds.
As part of the peace process, thousands of former rebel fighters are being kept at seven main camps and 21 satellite camps across Nepal with their weapons locked up under U.N. supervision.

"5432",2006742,"Title: Maoist strike paralyses Nepal towns, starts to bite in capital.rtf; Date: February 5, 2006 Sunday 9:20 AM GMT; Text: A general strike called by Maoist rebels to disrupt controversial elections this week brought towns across Nepal to a standstill Sunday, witnesses said.
The rebels -- who want to depose King Gyanendra and turn the poverty-stricken Himalayan nation into a communist state -- called the week-long strike to disrupt Wednesday's scheduled local elections.
The guerrillas are believed to have killed two candidates and have pledged to step up attacks in the run-up to polling day.
Tension has risen in Nepal in the run-up to the February 1 first anniversary of Gyanendra's sacking of the elected government, a step he justified by saying he needed emergency powers to quell the Maoist rebellion that has claimed some 12,500 lives since 1996.
Wednesday's polls are part of the king's declared ""road map"" to democracy. He has pledged they will be followed by general elections in the next 15 months. 
But the municipal elections are opposed by the Maoists and opposition parties, who have formed a loose anti-royal alliance. They condemn the polls as a sham aimed at legitimising the king's power grab.
The royal government, which has been rocked by recent street protests, has told Nepalis to ignore the Maoists' strike call and threatened to arrest those who try to stop businesses from opening or who vandalize property.
In the capital, most people appeared initially to have heeded the government's warning, with many businesses opening their doors in the morning, although fewer taxis and buses were seen on the streets.
By the afternoon, however, most traders had downed their shutters and the streets began emptying of vehicular traffic. Soldiers and army personnel launched foot and vehicle patrols.
In Nepalgunj, 510 kilometres (320 miles) west of Kathmandu, the strike brought activities to a standstill, a local journalist said, speaking by telephone from the gateway town to the Maoist dominated mid-western region.
""Normal life has been severely disrupted. Only vehicles belonging to security forces are on the streets,"" said Janak Nepal from the town of around 150,000 people close to the Indian border.
In Biratnagar, 540 kilometres east of Kathmandu, the strike also paralysed daily life, another journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""All markets are closed and not a single vehicle is on the streets, and there is a heavy security presence,"" he said.
Despite the security problems, the election will go ahead, Election Commission spokesman Tejmuni Bajracharya told AFP.
""Security agencies have pledged maximum security for the polls so we are confident that elections will be held smoothly, despite the difficult situation,"" said Bajracharya.
Elections are taking place only in 36 of Nepal's 58 municipalities. In 22 municipalities, officials have already been appointed as there were not enough candidates to contest the election, the spokesman said.
The recent killings of two candidates meant that voter turnout on Wednesday was likely to be small, the head of a human rights organization said.
""People have been terrified after recent incidents, so turnout will be very thin,"" said Subodh Pyakurel, chairman of the Informal Sector Service Centre.
There has been a dearth of candidates, and many of those that are standing are under government protection.
By holding the polls, ""the king is trying to give legitimacy"" to those who ""do not represent the actual voice of the people,"" said Dhurba Hari Adhikari, president of the Nepal Press Institute.

""The government of India welcomes the promulgation of the interim constitution and the formation of the interim legislature in Nepal,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
""These are significant milestones in Nepal's progress towards a new political era, which we hope will be characterized by peace, stability and economic development,"" it said.
Nepal's Maoists formally entered parliament late Monday after the temporary constitution that brings them into the interim parliament and strips the king of his executive powers was approved, bringing an end to a decade of civil war. The Maoists will hold 83 of the 330 seats.
The Indian foreign ministry statement also said United Nations monitors had begun arriving in Nepal ""to commence the process of arms management"".
The rebels and seven parties in government agreed last year to place their weapons and combatants under UN monitoring.
""This process must be credible and complete, before the formation of the interim government,"" the Indian statement said.
New Delhi remains ""committed to provide all the support to assist the people and the political parties of Nepal as they move forward on the peace process"", the statement added.
Nepal's new parliament will oversee elections expected in June 2007 to a body that will draft a new permanent constitution and tackle the controversial issue of the monarchy's fate.
The Maoists and the parties joined hands to lead mass protests in April 2006 that brought an end to 14 months of direct rule by King Gyanendra.
The rebels launched a deadly ""people's war"" in 1996 to install a communist republic in the impoverished Himalayan nation. The conflict claimed at least 12,500 lives and badly affected Nepal's already fragile economy.

  ""Maoists want to dominate regions and reach Madras. They want to stretch their corridor,"" said S.K. Raut, Additional Director General, Intelligence (Madhya Pradesh Police).
  The statement came after police unearthed an illegal arms factory run by Maoist guerillas and seize a large quantity of arms and ammunition and literature from here. 
  According to police, the latest recovery is indicative of the guerilla's attempt to stretch their corridor.
  ""It is done by their People's Guerilla Army and the technical wing supports them,"" Raut added. 
  Disclosing the figures of the arrested persons, Raut said at least six persons have been arrested.
  ""During the interrogation, the arrested men have revealed that they had links with Nepali Maoists. The parts of weapons which we have seized suggest that the Naxalites were working on them and were trying to develop similar technologically advanced weapons,"" said Raut. 
  Maoists operate in 13 of 29 states along what is called a ""red corridor"" stretching from the border with Nepal to Andhra Pradesh.
  Madhya Pradesh is one of the states affected by Maoist insurgency. 
  The Maoists have pitted their campaign against landlords and the state administration whom they accuse of exploiting the poor.
  Last week, a human rights group said Maoist violence increased in India in 2006 resulting in nearly 750 deaths. 
  In 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called them the biggest internal security challenge facing India since independence. 
  According to Home Ministry, 76 districts in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Maharashtra, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are 'badly affected by Maoist violence'.
  More than 700 people have died and over 50,000 have been made homeless as a result of fighting between rebels and an anti-Maoist group Salwa Judum in the state since June 2005.

"6717",20082825,"Title: Nepal 's 'god-king' loses his crown.rtf; Date: May 28, 2008 Wednesday 10:23 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra, whose rule was born out of tragedy, was Thursday facing life as a common citizen and as a humiliated final chapter of a dynasty that dates back over two centuries.
Gyanendra's ouster caps a turbulent reign that began in 2001 when he was vaulted to the throne by the massacre of his popular brother, King Birendra, and eight other royals by the crown prince, who later shot himself.
The monarch was traditionally revered as the incarnation of the Hindu god of protection, Vishnu, but Gyanendra lost the support of many Nepalese when he seized absolute power to crush a bloody Maoist revolt.
""The king and his own family are to be blamed"" for his ouster, said analyst Lok Raj Baral, who heads the Nepal Centre for Strategic Studies.
""He never became a democratic king. He tried to be a one-man show. His greed for power, his arrogance and autocratic nature damaged the image of the monarchy beyond repair.""
Gyanendra's 2005 ""royal coup"" united the fiercely republican Maoists and mainstream parties, who staged huge pro-democracy protests and forced the king to restore parliament after just over a year of direct rule during which he made scant headway against the insurgents. 
This led to a 2006 peace deal ending the bloody revolt that had claimed 13,000 lives. It also paved the way for the constitutional assembly's vote and the end to the 240-year-old Shah dynasty.
The king missed the 2001 deadly rampage at the pink palace because he was travelling, while his son Paras, who was present, escaped unscathed.
But the dour-faced monarch was accused by many Nepalese of plotting the killings, even though an official inquiry blamed Birendra's son, saying he had been angered by the royal family's refusal to let him wed the woman he loved.
The reputation of Paras for reckless driving and playboy living also hurt the king, although Paras is now more likely to be found on the golf course than in nightclubs since suffering a heart attack at age 36.
Gyanendra never attained the popularity of his more genial, well-loved brother, who was seen as a symbol of unity in Nepal.
His removal will mark the second time he has lost his throne -- having been briefly declared monarch as a toddler when his grandfather, then-king Tribhuvan, fled to India during a bitter 1950 power battle.
Gyanendra was sent to school in the Indian hill station of Darjeeling and graduated from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan University.
It was not clear what the king, known for his obsession with astrology, will do next, although he has insisted he has no plans to leave the impoverished nation.
A successful businessman before becoming king, he was reputed to be one of the world's wealthiest royals, with interests in hotels, tea and tobacco, and substantial properties and investments abroad.
The Maoists say the king is welcome to remain in Nepal, provided he lives like an ordinary citizen in a private residence.

""In our efforts on capacity building, 50 police officers are ready for deployment to Darfur in Sudan,"" Oliver Kumbambe, inspector general of the Malawi police, said in a statement.
The southern African nation, which has 6,500 policemen, has not given details on exactly when it would deploy the police force.
This will be Malawi's largest police contigent on a peacekeeping mission.       Twenty-seven Malawi police officers are currently in Liberia and two are in Kosovo. Malawi last year pledged to send 800 troops to Darfur to serve in the peacekeeping force.
According to conservative estimates, Malawi has about 10,000 troops.
At least 200,000 people have died and more than two million have fled their homes since the ethnic minority rebels took up arms against Sudan's Arab-dominated regime in February 2003, according to the UN figures, disputed by Khartoum.
The Darfur mission, the UN's largest, will eventually consist of 20,000 troops and 6,000 police and civilian personnel, but only around 9,000 troops and police are currently in place.
The force, which has a budget of 1.2 billion dollars for 2008, still needs 24 helicopters to patrol an area the size of France.
Troops currently on the ground are mainly Rwandan, South African, Nigerian and Senegalese, accompanied by Kenyans, Gambians and a Chinese engineering corps as well as 1,000 police from more than 25 countries.
Additional soldiers from Egypt, Ethiopia and Pakistan and police from Nepal will deploy in the next two months.

The father of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan, said the lost reporters represent ""the ultimate strength of open society as well as its ultimate vulnerability.""
Judea Pearl said his son was killed ""not for what he wrote or planned to write but for what he represented.""
""To his killers,"" Pearl said, ""he represented the ideas that every person in every civilized society aspires to uphold - modernity, openness, pluralism, freedom of inquiry, truth and respect for all people.""
Joe Urschel, executive director of the Newseum, said 17 of the 31 journalists were targeted because of their profession.
""In many cases, they knew that their efforts to get close to the story placed them in danger,"" Urschel said during an annual ceremony to rededicate the memorial, which has a sweeping view of Washington across the Potomac River.
Last year's deaths brings to 1,475 the toll of reporters, photographers, broadcasters and other journalists who died as a result of injury or illness while covering the news, from 1812 to 2002. As the sun painted a rainbow of colors across the spiraling glass memorial Friday morning, journalists and family members read each name aloud.
Already, names are mounting for next year's service.
At least a dozen journalists died while covering the war in Iraq, and two more are missing, said Susan Bennett, director of international exhibits for the Freedom Forum's Newseum. The foundation, dedicated to free speech and free press, maintains the journalists memorial, adding the previous year's names each May.
Names of the war dead, including NBC News reporter David Bloom, Atlantic Monthly editor-at-large Michael Kelly and Associated Press Television News cameraman Nazeh Darwazeh, will be embedded between glass panes in 2004.
Journalists killed in 2002 included a newspaper editor and a broadcaster who were shot in separate incidents in Colombia; both had received death threats. In Russia, attacks on two editors and a reporter were linked to their investigative reporting. Journalists in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal and the Philippines also appear to have been killed because of their work, the foundation said.
Two journalists died in gunfire while covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One was struck by a U.S. tank during military exercises in Kuwait. Others died in Papua New Guinea, Uganda and Venezuela.
Alongside Pearl, Americans on this year's list are:
-Larry Greene, 50, a photographer with KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, killed in a Navy helicopter crash in the North Arabian Gulf.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 23 June
Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Mahanta Thakur has publicly told the Nepalese Army not to interfere with the peace process. Minister Thakur also called on the army not to be involved in the politics of press statement and immediately stop such activities. He said the army, which is now under the control of the sovereign parliament was being watched closely by the government.
Speaking at the Reporters' Club in the capital today, Minister Thakur, who is from the Nepali Congress party, said that the army had been brought under the purview of the parliament and it was now objectionable to see the army being involved in the politics of political press statements.
Stating that it was possible that the army's press statement was aimed at foiling the peace process in the absence of the prime minister, he said the Nepalese people would fight against any attempt to foil the peace process. He said, as soon as the prime minister and defence minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, returns from Bangkok, he would raise the issue of the army's press statement with prime minister. 
He also made it clear that the government was committed to overcome any obstacle that was a hindrance to ending the 10 years of bloody conflict.
Stating that the eight-point agreement signed between the government and the Maoists was designed to take the country forward, he claimed that there were some forces that were trying to break the agreement.
In reference to the issue of the monarchy, he said that the Nepali Congress had removed the king from its party statute and said his party would not even support the ghost of the monarchy. He said his party would not give any space to the institution of monarchy in the election to a constituent assembly. He said the Nepali Congress believes in the mandate of the people and would accept the verdict of the people for a Nepal democratic republic.
In reference to a question regarding the prime minister's comments favouring a ceremonial role for the king, Minister Thakur said he was not aware why the prime minister made such comments. However, he did say that the Nepali Congress would not carry the burden of the monarchy on its shoulders. He made it clear that he would personally take a stance against any role for the king. Stating that his stance against the king was the same while he was a member of the government as well as when he was outside it, Minister Thakur said the future of the country could not be guaranteed as long as there was any role for the king in the country.
Minister Thakur said that efforts were being initiated to bring the Maoists into an interim government and he said the government was doing some specific homework for this. He said the issue of bringing the Maoists into an interim government and the management of their weapons would proceed together.

The two sides signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement on Tuesday spelling out how the insurgents will set aside their weapons as part of a wide-reaching pact to end the Himalayan nation's 10-year conflict.
The council agreed that ""the United Nations should respond positively and expeditiously"" to an appeal from the government and the rebels for assistance in implementing key aspects of the agreement, particularly in managing arms and armed personnel from both sides and in monitoring elections.
The pact signed on Tuesday details how tens of thousands of rebel fighters would be confined to seven main camps under U.N. supervision ahead of elections next year.
The Security Council expressed support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan to send a technical assessment mission to Nepal to come up with a proposal for U.N. assistance, including a U.N. political mission ""to deliver the assistance requested."" It also backed Annan's plan to send an advance team of up to 35 U.N. monitors and 25 U.N. electoral personnel.
""The Security Council stands ready to consider the secretary-general's formal proposals as soon as the technical assessment is complete,"" said the council statement read by its current president, Qatar's U.N. Ambassador Nassir Al-Nasser.
On Wednesday, Nepal's government and communist rebels were working to finalize an interim constitution as part of the peace process. The interim constitution would have to be in place before 73 rebels join the proposed 330-seat interim Parliament.
The presidential statement was drafted by Britain, which was asked by Nepal to take the lead in getting the Security Council to help promote the peace process.
""What we've mapped out today is a way in which the U.N. ... should rally behind the positive developments in Nepal,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry said afterward. ""I really hope this leads on to something positive and that all the different agencies, funds, and different parts of the U.N. family now rally behind Nepal.""
U.S. Ambassador John Bolton called the agreement ""a positive sign"" and backed the U.N. assessment mission.
""This is an early indication that we want to be in support of a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Nepal and show that to all the parties and to the people of Nepal. So that's why we wanted to move quickly,"" he said.

The bomb blew up when security guards stopped the bus, heading from Terhathum district to Dharan township, for a security check, police said.
The violence was the latest in the impoverished kingdom sandwiched between India and China that has been racked by an increasingly deadly Maoist revolt which has claimed more than 9,000 lives since 1996.
The explosion killed a security guard, the bus conductor and a passenger, police said.
""Five civilians who were injured in the explosion were rushed to the B.P. Memorial Hospital in Dharan for treatment,"" a police official said.
Meanwhile, the rebels claimed responsibility for shooting to death the mayor of a town south of the Nepal capital, accusing him of leaking information about Maoist activities.
Gopal Giri, mayor of Birgunj town, was gunned down Thursday.
A source close to the mayor said the rebels had tried to get him to pay them 500,000 rupees but he had refused, saying he did not have the funds.
""For a number of reasons, we have killed Giri and we are responssible for his death,"" the Maoists said in their statement.
Giri's killing came after the Maoists pledged last November that they would no longer kill opposition party activists nor extort money from businessmen.
The rebels are battling to overthrow the monarchy and install a communist republic in the Himalayan nation.

""MONUC troops at 6:00 am launched an operation to dismantle the camp of the Armed Forces of the Congolese People (FAPC)"" at Mahagi, north of the main local town of Bunia, MONUC spokesman Christophe Boulierac said by telephone.
The UN peacekeeping troops, part of a force deployed across the vast country in the wake of a devastating 1998-2003 war, found the camp still occupied by several dozen militia men when they moved in ""without firing a single shot,"" Boulierac said.
Most of the members of the FAPC, one of six armed groups still active in the volatile region, managed to escape.
On Sunday, MONC forces went into another FAPC camp at Ndrele, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Mahagi, after an exchange of gunfire.
Boulierac said the Mahagi camp was located near a transit camp for militia members ready to turn in their weapons under a voluntary operation which began in September.
It was ""a hindrance for any fighter who wanted to disarm"", he added.

""The parties decided to suspend the election and all processes related to the poll,"" Prakash Sharan Mahat, leader of the Nepali Congress Party, the largest party in the alliance, said.
The decision was reached at a three-day meeting at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's residence in Kathmandu.
They failed to reach an understanding on the Maoist demand to declare Nepal a republic and opt for a fully proportional electoral system, Mahat said. The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) is among the seven-party coalition.
The Election Commission will issue a notice to this effect later Friday.
The commission had set Friday as the deadline for the parties to file their list of candidates for the election.
""There was no agreement on the Maoist demands, and therefore this decision had to be taken,"" Mahat said.
The Maoists refused to file their candidacies at the Election Commission on Friday and threatened to prevent other parties from filing candidacies either.
It is the second time the constituent assembly election, which is expected to cap the country's 10-month-old peace process with the Maoists, has been pushed back.
Earlier, the election was put off in mid-June this year after the commission said it was not ready.
According to Mahat, a special session of parliament Koirala is expected to call in the next two weeks. It will decide on the twin Maoist demands and will also set a new date of the assembly election.
The assembly will be asked to write the country's new constitution.
The Maoists, who agreed earlier that the first meeting of the assembly will decide the fate of the monarchy and the assembly will be elected through a mixed electoral system, have lately demanded the country be declared a republic before the election and the election be fully proportional.
The Maoists quit the interim government Sept. 18 over disagreement on the demands.
Koirala, who heads the Nepali Congress, has refused to give in.
Peace Minister Ram Chandra Poudel, who is a senior Nepali Congress leader, said, ""We have no choice. The election without the Maoists holds no meaning.""
The Maoists, who waged a decade-long violent insurgency from 1996, joined the peace process last November by signing a peace pact with the mainstream parties. More than 13,000 people died during the insurgency.

TEACHERS have long been the envy of the working man, leaving work at about 3, summers off. But little is what it seems. Following, find 10 teachers and their summer adventures, from teaching on a trash heap and training all summer to teach in the fall, to avoiding bulls on Ireland's pathways and discovering the idiosyncrasies of endangered sea turtles.
Months as a Missionary
 In the early 1980's, Christina LaRosa was teaching Spanish at Middletown High School. One day she picked up a magazine. The page fell open to a Maryknoll Mission advertisement that read, ''What are you doing this summer? Do you have time to serve God?'' She sent away for a catalog of missionary opportunities throughout the world, interviewed with the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus in New York and was hired for a summer position in Mexico. 
  ''My first summer was an eye-opener,'' said Mrs. LaRosa, who was single at the time. ''My job was to teach the children who lived in the garbage dump. My first few days I cried a lot. I had a lot of trouble understanding why I was born in Middletown in a house with running water and lots of shoes, and these kids were living in cardboard shacks, picking the garbage to sell it and trying to find food and clothing in the trash to eat.'' 
 Her classroom was a blue tarp atop rotting garbage. The next summer, Maryknoll was able to buy land at the dump. In following summers, Mrs. LaRosa helped build a school, digging a latrine, hoisting 125-pound bags of cement and teaching students how to read and write in Spanish and converse in English. After 10 years, the local government recognized the garbage-dump community, providing financial support. Full-time teachers were assigned to the school, another building was built, a pre-kindergarten program was begun.
 Mrs. LaRosa continued to teach after her marriage seven years ago. ''I have to say 'thank you' for everything I have by giving time, and as a teacher, that time is the summertime,'' Mrs. LaRosa said. ''Those summers were my professional development. I just did mine in a garbage dump.''
In the Rainforest
 Heather Lloyd took an ecology course the summer before her senior year at the University of Connecticut that required her to hike the Amazon rainforest. The guide for her group, Judy Logback, talked about a craft cooperative, Kallari, a Kichua word meaning ancient, that she had founded to create international markets for hand-woven goods made by the indigenous peoples of the area. 
 Ms. Lloyd's interest was piqued. 
 ''The people were so generous with us, giving us their best food when they don't have that much to give, and it made me want to do something that could contribute,'' she said. Now a first-grade teacher at Hebron Avenue School in Glastonbury, Ms. Lloyd is an advocate for the crafts cooperative, selling the goods at Manhattan street fairs and at home shows that are much like Tupperware parties. She travels to Ecuador each summer and is now collecting information and materials to develop a unit for American students to learn about the forest cultures and the ways in which the rainforest affects climate. 
 ''I want children to understand how the rainforest is beneficial to the human race,'' she said. ''I initially went because I wanted to see monkeys in the forest and pretty mountains. And I came back and my life was changed.'' 
Hiking Ireland
 Myles Cohen, a guidance counselor at Flood Middle School in Stratford, has spent the last two summers hiking with his wife, Mary Cohen, in Ireland. They carried what they needed on their backs until nightfall, walking the lush, remote Beara Peninsula from one bed and breakfast to the next. 
 ''We wanted to go to a country that speaks English in case we got lost,'' he said. They relied on a compass and the weather for safe passage. ''You're talking Ireland, which has a huge amount of rainfall and a lot of the paths are not easily discernible and the fog rolls in and you can't see in front of your face,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''My wife fell in a bog. She looks wonderful in black.'' 
 The friendliness of the Irish people gave them their biggest thrill. 
 ''The farmers come out from their farmhouses carrying their address books, and say 'Look, we know someone in Connecticut,''' Mr. Cohen said. Bulls shared the narrow pathways of the peninsula with the slightly alarmed couple. ATM machines were hard to find. 
 This summer, they are off to Switzerland, to challenge the altitude, between the bed and breakfasts.
Vacancy at the Inn
 Bill Berghoff teaches physics and chemistry at Choate-Rosemary Hall in Wallingford during the school year and supervises a dormitory of 30 boys. His wife, Tina Berghoff, teaches hearing-impaired children in a birth-to-3 program in Wethersfield. They live with their three elementary-school-aged children in an apartment connected to the dorm. As if they didn't have enough to do keeping an eye on folks during the school year, the couple bought a bed and"

 Gautam at the same time urged the political parties to express commitment not to repeat the mistakes they committed in the past. According to him, political parties must now convince the people that they are able to ensure good governance.
 First step towards this, according to him, would be to sign a code of conduct outlining their commitments.

Fourth suggestion has it that that the Maoists and the security forces should sign a human rights agreement. His fifth suggestion is that both the sides should initiate the process peace talks at the earliest.

"1750",20044034,"Title: Nepal parties vow more protests on anniversary of democracy restoration.rtf; Date: April 8, 2004 Thursday; Text: Leaders of a week of pro-democracy demonstrations in Kathmandu threatened Thursday to storm King Gyanendra's palace as they marked the 14th anniversary of the restoration of now-defunct elected rule.
Tens of thousands of protesters rallied in central Kathmandu for the eighth straight day, chanting slogans against King Gyanendra demanding he restore an elected government.
""We will in the coming days cross the barricades to the palace as we enter the final stage in our struggle,"" said Krishna Gopal Shrestha, the chief organiser of the protests sponsored by a five-party alliance.
It was a similar action that led then King Birendra, King Gyanendra's late brother, to announce on April 8, 1990 that he would allow political parties and an elected parliament, ending three decades of absolute royal rule.
King Birendra's palace guards had opened fire on demonstrators who tried to rush onto the palace in the culmination of six weeks of protests.
The then royalist prime minister, Krishna Bahadur Bhattarai, said at the time that up to 500 demonstrators were killed, although later accounts have questioned whether the death toll was so high.
This year's protests are led by veterans of the 1990 struggle who are furious that King Gyanendra effectively ended democratic rule by dismissing the elected premier as ""incompetent"" in 2002 and delaying elections.
Leading human rights activist Kapil Shrestha said the protests were picking up at a similar pace as 14 years ago.
""Once again we are obliged to take to the streets against the king's steps to thwart the people's sovereign rights,"" Shrestha said.
He noted that the protests in Kathmandu were drawing a wide spectrum of society. Among the participants in Thursday's demonstrations were 1,000 handicapped people, who chanted slogans from their wheelchairs as part of a group of Nepalese with disabilities that has joined the protests.
Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a senior political leader during democratic rule, said that in light of the anniversary ""our protests from Friday will be more vigorous.""
""We achieved democratic rights by shedding the blood of hundreds of people and we are back in the streets to demand the same rights again,"" Adhikari said.
King Gyanendra has however ignored the protesters, noting widespread discontent with corruption and lack of development during the parties' rule.
As the protests pick up in Kathmandu, the king has been touring villages meeting with people injured in a Maoist insurgency aimed at overthrowing the monarchy. More than 9,500 people have been killed in the uprising, launched in 1996.
The Maoists have offered moral support to the protests in Kathmandu.
The king has pledged to allow elections by April 2005, but the parties demand the vote be held under a ""neutral government.""

 Darchula [district in farwestern Nepal], 6 October: After the Maoists put pressure on the families of security personnel to bring home their sons and daughters serving the police and the army, over 800 people have surrounded the district administration office.
 On Wednesday [5 October], the families surrounded the administration office, raised slogans and staged a sit in. They chanted slogans like ""Cease-fire should be declared immediately. You cannot kill our children. You must create an environment to make people return home"".
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Oct 05, p 5
The families had surrounded the administration office from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. After sit in they handed over a memorandum to the chief district officer.
 Almost every day the Maoists have been forcibly involving civilians in their campaigns in the villages in the district. The Maoists have been pressurizing the families of the security forces to force their sons and daughters leave their jobs and return home. ""They have warned us that if we failed to bring back our sons and daughters they would padlock your house,"" Harihar Singh Dhami of Shankarpur village said, adding, ""The government must pay attention to our woes.""
 The Maoists had pressurized the people of Marma, Duhu and Lekam areas to come to the district headquarters. ""We came when they warned of stern actions,"" Krishna Singh Bhandari of Gokuleshwor village said. ""They have told the women to come to district headquarters once we return home,"" he added. The Maoists sent them to district headquarters with various placards and banners. A participant said that the Maoists have stepped up surveillance around the district headquarters, Khalanga. ""They have said that they are waiting for a message from us,"" a worried Arjun Thagunna of Khad village said, adding, ""I don't know what they will do once we return home.""
 Chief District Officer Lok Raj Regmi said that was not appropriate on the part of the Maoists to chase villagers to district headquarters. Regmi, however, supported the demand for a cease-fire and said that he informed the Home Ministry of the matter.

At least 130 protesters were arrested and some of the demonstrators and policemen were injured in the scuffle.

Madhav Kumar Nepal, the consensus candidate for the five opposition parties waging a campaign against the government, called on both sides to keep the peace.
""Whatever the reasons may be for the stalling of peace talks, there should not be a resumption of hostilities between the two sides,"" Madhav Kumar Nepal told activists of his party Wednesday in the southwestern district of Bhairahawa, party members said.
A long-delayed third round of peace talks between the Maoists and the government broke down Tuesday as the rebels pressed for an assembly to rewrite the constitution and demanded an apology for the killing of at least 17 its cadres by the army at the weekend.
Madhav Kumar Nepal is the leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, the kingdom's largest mainstream leftist movement and one of five parties that is leading protests against Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa.
The five-party alliance wants Madhav Kumar Nepal to be prime minister ahead of new elections. King Gyanendra in October dismissed the elected premier for alleged ""incompetence"" and suspended polls which the government had called two years ahead of schedule.
The Maoists had asked for the five-party alliance to take part in the peace talks, but it refused as it does not want to recognise the Thapa government.
""The government has not created the right atmosphere for the major political parties to participate in the talks,"" Nepal said.
""If the talks are breaking down because members of the talks team do not have the right authority, the government should do what is needed,"" he said.
The Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional monarchy in an insurgency that has left more than 7,800 people dead.
The two sides reached a ceasefire January 29, which remains largely in force despite a series of skirmishes, the deadliest of which was the weekend attack that left dead 17 Maoists.

Refugees from the Fulero, Shi and Twa tribes began returning home two weeks ago after a visit by Congolese authorities who promised them that it was safe to return, said Onesphore Nduwimana, the mayor of a Rugombo, a town near one of the refugees camps.
Nduwimana rejected reports that refugees were fleeing Burundi out of fear of another rebel attack like one that left 163 Congolese dead on Aug. 13 at a refugee camp near Gatumba.
""The refugees returned on their personal will and their own decision,"" Nduwimana said. ""They said there is security back home.""
An estimated 30,000 Congolese refugees crossed into Burundi following fighting in June.
The Congolese refugee camps set up in western Burundi house different ethnic groups because the tribes insisted on being segregated. The Gatumba camp housed Congolese Tutsis, also known as Banyamulenge, who have been involved in Congo's civil war.
Refugees have complained of receiving little assistance from the U.N. refugee agency since the attack, Nduwimana said. But the mayor said security in the camps was adequate.
""There is security around all the camps guarded by U.N. troops. Troops from Nepal and Pakistan guard both Banyamulenge camps and the camp that hosts other Congolese ethnic groups,"" Nduwimana said. He said that few Banyamulenge have returned home.
A preliminary U.N. report on the Gatumba massacre, released in New York on Friday, points to a Burundian Hutu rebel group operating in conjunction with armed groups from Rwanda and Congo, U.N. diplomats said.
Spain's U.N. Ambassador Juan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo, the current council president, said afterward that the United Nations is continuing its investigation but ""it seems that several groups involving people from several countries in the region may have had a part in the events.""
In a recent report, Secretary-General Kofi Annan cited reports that the Burundian rebel National Liberation Force, which has claimed responsibility for the massacre, operated in alliance with Congolese tribal fighters known as Mai Mai and Rwandan Hutu rebels from the ex-FAR and Interahamwe militias who fled to Congo after playing a central role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
""All the indications continue to be in that direction,"" Yanez-Barnuevo said, when asked whether the preliminary finding agreed with Annan's initial reports.

Text of report by Jitendra Sah by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 13 July
Kathmandu, 13 July: Two months have passed since the Nepal government announced the dropping of all terrorist tags and the red corner notice on the Maoist rebels, but the International Crime Police Organization, more commonly known as Interpol, still features them on its ""most wanted"" list.
Following the announcement on 3 May by the seven-party alliance government and the start of peace talks, the Nepal Police had removed the names of its top leaders from its website.
Interpol is the second biggest organization in the world after the UN. Its website lists Puspakamal Dahal, 51 (Chitwan), alias Prachanda; Dr Baburam Bhattarai, 52 ([of] Gorkha); Pampha Bhusal (Argakhanchi); Krishna Bahadur Mahara, 48 (Rolpa); and Agni Sapkota, 48 (Sindhupalchowk).
Dharmendra Basnet, 44, Lekhnath Bhatta, 49, Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, 38, Posta Bahadur Bogati, 64, Santosh Buda, 45, Chandraprakash Gajurel, 58, Mohan Baidya, 71, and Devendra Parajuli, 35 are among others in the list of 26 Maoist leaders.
According to spokesman of the police headquarters Rameshchandra Thakuri, the Nepal Police had informed Interpol of the changes immediately after the council's decision. ""The delay must have been due to procedural aspects of the organization (Interpol),"" he said.
An officer of the Home Ministry, however, said that like America, France could have its own view on the Maoists as terrorists. 
""Since the people featured on Interpol's list have to be handed over to their own country, the Maoist leaders featured on the Interpol website is not very significant,"" the officer added.

Veteran mountaineers are gathering in the Nepalese capital next week for the event, including Hillary and Junko Tabei, who in 1975 became the first woman to reach the summit. Tenzing Norgay died in 1986.
With only a few days left in the climbing season, the thwarted mountaineers on the Nepalese side had hoped to reach the 29,035-foot-high summit after several days of better weather. Increasingly strong winds and rain forced them to return to the highest camp, at 26,240 feet.
The weather has been mostly unfavorable on Everest this year. Climbers have lost tents, equipment and supplies in wind storms, which have forced many to retreat to base camp at 17,400 feet.
The Nepalese government has issued climbing permits to 22 expedition teams for the March to May season, each with about 12 members plus Sherpas who help carry gear up the icy slopes.
Meeting with Indian mountaineers in New Delhi, Hillary, 83, described how he wriggled to the top of a 12-meter rock wall and stepped onto the snow-blanketed ridge on May 29, 1953: ""I realized we were on top of Mount Everest and the whole world was spread out below us.""
More than 1,200 climbers have reached the summit since then, and at least 175 have died trying.
Climbers on the northern side of the mountain in Tibet fought snow and high winds during the final stretch to the top.
John Roskelley, 54, and his son Jess, of Spokane, reported their success in a satellite telephone call home. ""Being able to do it together was a dream for both of them,"" said Dan McConnell, a spokesman for the Roskelley's trip who received the call.
Nepalese mountaineering officials said they knew of no American younger than 20 reaching the summit, but that they did not keep official records.
Eight Chinese and three South Korean climbers also reached the summit, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.

""I can remember when I look back to those days in 1953 as clearly as I did when I climbed the mountain with Tenzing Norgay,"" Hillary told dozens of mountaineers from the Indian Mountaineering Federation on Wednesday. India, Nepal, Britain and New Zealand are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Everest climb.
Dressed in a black suit and tie, New Zealander Hillary, 83, endured New Delhi's sweltering heat to pass out plaques to the mountaineers, many of whom have reached the Everest summit. The first Indian citizen to achieve the feat was Norgay, the Sherpa who accompanied Hillary on the pioneering climb.
Describing how he wriggled to the top of a 40-foot (12-meter) rock wall, and stepped onto the snow-blanketed ridge on May 29, 1953, Hillary said, ""I realized we were on top of Mount Everest and the whole world was spread out below us. After 50 years I can remember the feeling of satisfaction.""
Hillary said he reached out to shake Norgay's hand. ""But that wasn't enough for Tenzing. He threw his arms around my shoulders, and I threw my arms around his shoulders, too, and we celebrated together.""
Hillary said he had no idea ""of the impact this would have on the world in general, and me.""
But as the British expedition headed down the mountain to Katmandu, Nepal's capital, runners kept bringing newspapers and messages from around the world.
""Then we knew, because we had succeeded when so many other great climbers had failed, that we had become heroes of the mountaineering world,"" he said.
Addressing the mountaineers who have not yet scaled Everest, he said, ""If you reach the top of the world, it will give you a satisfaction you'll never forget.""

The attack took place in hilly terrain in Rohtas district, 125 miles west of Patna, the capital of the eastern Indian state of Bihar, said Ritu Raj, the deputy inspector-general of police.
The civilians killed were the driver of the vehicle and a village guard, Raj said.
Raj said militants of the outlawed Maoist Communist Center were suspected in the attack since the area is their stronghold. Other details were not immediately available.
The rebels work closely with the People's War Group, another guerrilla group, and are active in five southern and eastern states. They are also suspected of having close links with Nepal's communist rebels.
More than 6,000 people have been killed since the rebels, inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1981. The insurgents mostly target rich landowners and police.

"171",2003471,"Title: Leading Nepal communist defends talks with Maoists.rtf; Date: December 1, 2003, Monday; Text: Text of guest commentary by Yuvaraj Gyawali, member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), carried by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 1 December
 Keeping in view the conflict situation in the country, when we saw signs of more killing, violence, vandalism and destruction of infrastructure, when there was no sign of stopping, when the government that should be responsible for all this became irresponsible, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) UML felt that someone should take initiatives to stop this and after due mandate from the central committee started talks with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
 In the present situation there is a triangular conflict in the country i.e the mainstream political parties, the king and the prime minister and the Maoists . The situation is not that anyone should underestimate anyone and sideline him, it is not possible to move forward by eliminating the Maoists, and it would be a daydream to think of ruling the country by sidelining the parties.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1 Dec 03 p6
The UML has stressed a tripartite agreement. At present, there is an environment of lack of communication in the country. From whatever side, efforts must be made to break this, and because of the government's conduct towards the Maoists, no-one would dare to make it public even if he had met the Maoists. So in such a situation, thinking that the problems could be solved only by talks, the UML leaders held talks with the Maoists.
 In the Lucknow talks in which Gyawali took part , that discussion was held with the Maoists at length and in a friendly environment. During the talks, with a firm stance of seeking a solution to the conflict in the country, a request was made to the Maoists for cooperation. But when they said they would not compromise over a constituent assembly, the talks could make no progress.
 When the Maoists said that the country could not progress while there is a king, and the country's advancement would grind to a halt, and asked to collaborate with them to bring about a republic, the UML outrightly rejected it. The UML doesn't want a civil war in the country in the name of bringing a republic. The UML is fully confident that a solution can be achieved by way of talks.
 Though the talks with the Maoists were a failure, the UML has reopened the way for discussions which was closed from all sides. And to give continuity to this we are trying to have an audience with the king. And after that we hope to talk with the Maoists. In such a situation the talks should have been praised from all sides, but the people have taken the UML's step positively.
 The government has termed the talks irresponsible. What can we hope for from a government which itself is irresponsible? The government wants to cling to power in the name of the Maoist problem. We did not go to Lucknow to ask them to make General Secreatry Comrade Madhav Nepal prime minister or to support us. We went to stop the tripartite conflict and break the impasse in communication.
 When the senior leaders of the Nepali Congress have taken the Lucknow talks positively, I wonder why the senior leader of our party Mr K.P. Sharma Oli is protesting it. This is his personal matter, let's not make further comment on this.

 Kathmandu, 30 November: The Bhutanese human rights leader Tek Nath Rizal has warned that if the Nepal-Bhutan Joint Verification Team once again places the bona-fide Bhutanese refugees at camps in Nepal on the ""non-Bhutanese"" list he would come out strongly against it. He said: ""If the team carries out such a categorization as in the past, we will surround the supreme courts of Nepal and India and go to the International Court of Justice.""
 Bhutanese leader Rizal made the observation at a time when the Joint Verification Team is about to begin from Monday the categorization of the 2,950 Bhutanese refugees living in the Kundanbari refugee camp who were categorized as ""non-Bhutanese"" earlier by the Joint Verification Team.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1 Dec 03 p1
Rizal, while saying that it is only natural for refugees to have no identification papers with them since they always leave their country or are driven from their country during difficult times, said ""to categorize the refugees without adequate proof as non-Bhutanese is in itself an injustice"".
 ""What kind of papers should be sought from those who have been freed from prison, have undergone extreme torture and ran way to save their lives and were dumped on Indian soil?"", he counter-questioned while talking to Rajdhani. He advised that the categorization of those refugees who had been stripped of identification in Bhutan itself and then hounded out should be done through some other mechanism.
 Their citizenship could be verified on the basis of their neighbours and through a questionnaire with fixed criteria or other means, he argued.
 Since the Joint Verification Team comprises of those who were in its ranks earlier, Rizal is suspicious of its categorization process. He said: ""Since the international and refugees' representatives are not allowed to sit in the team, there is no room to be satisfied over their intention.""
 The refugees staying in the Kundanbari refugee camp appealed against their categorization by the earlier Joint Verification Team as ""non-Bhutanese"" and demanded the rights enjoyed by other Bhutanese by claiming that they were bona-fide Bhutanese. After 95 per cent of those who had been categorized as non-Bhutanese had appealed for a re-categorization, both sides agreed in the 15th ministerial-level talks held in Thimpu to carry out a re-categorization.  passage omitted

India, which borders Nepal on three sides, has traditionally had a major influence on Nepal's political and economic affairs. But recently there have been concerns that the new prime minister Prachanda who led Nepal's Maoist rebels may favor China.
These fears were heightened when Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, made his first trip after taking office to China to attend the Beijing Olympics. Nepal's prime ministers traditionally visit India first. Prachanda arrived there on Sunday.
""Due to our specific historical, cultural and geographical relations and due to the old tradition of economic interdependence, our relations with India are crucial and vital,"" Prachanda told a gathering of Indian business leaders.
Both India and Nepal are Hindu majority nations and Nepal gets all its oil products and most of its consumer goods from India. Landlocked Nepal also has to depend on India to move cargo and passenger traffic.
However, he said his country also wanted to enhance its relations with China, which borders it to the north.
He has said his visit to China was not a political trip and that this visit to New Delhi was his first official trip as prime minister. However, he did meet Chinese leaders in Beijing.
Prachanda was scheduled to meet Indian President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, leader of governing Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, and the leader of the opposition, Lal Krishna Advani, later Monday.
On Monday, Prachanda asked private Indian businesses to invest in his country in agriculture, hydropower, tourism and other economic fields ""to realize the dream of being together and growing together.""
Prachanda will also visit the southern city of Bangalore, India's information technology hub, before returning home on Thursday.

Tabei, who arrived here to attend celebrations next week marking the 50th anniversary of the conquest of the mountain by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary, said climbing on Everest had become too commercialised.
""New mountaineering techniques have been developed. The ropes are pre-fixed before the climber reaches the summit of Everest,"" she said.
""Climbing Mount Everest is now becoming more commercialized than other mountain sports,"" she lamented.
Recalling her ascent of Everest in 1975, Tabei said, ""During those days permission for the Mount Everest assault by women was very difficult but now it is easier and so many teams are going there.""
""Permission for expeditions to climb Mount Everest should be limited to three per year at the most,"" Tabei said in response to a question. ""Let the mountain remain in peace.""
While scaling the peak was not that difficult, she added, ""the main problem is the weather.""
Asked whether she wants her daughter and son to follow in her footsteps to the top of earth's tallest pinnacle, Tabei replied, ""My son is now 24 and studying at university and my 32-year-old daughter is more inclined to skiing than mountain climbing.""
Tabei has climbed several major peaks -- Cho Oyu and Everest in Nepal, and Xixapangma in Tibet -- as well as Broad Peak in Pakistan.
""I want to climb major peaks as far as possible on all continents,"" Tabei said.
She welcomed the decision of the Nepalese authorities to stage special celebrations to mark the Golden Jubilee of the conquest of Everest, adding she hoped to meet many Everest summiters in the next week.
The Mount Everest Golden Jubilee organisers are planning to honour Taibe, 12-times Everest summiter Apa Sherpa and other distinguished alpinists with a horse-drawn procession through the streets of Kathmandu next week, Nepal Tourist Board (NTB) sources said.
Tabei was to leave Kathmandu for Lukla, in the Everest region, by air Thursday to have another view of the famous peak before returning to Kathmandu on May 26 to participate in the celebrations.
More than 200 foreign Everest conquerors are scheduled to participate.
Among them are Hillary and his son Peter, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler, who climbed Mount Everest in 1978 without the aid of artificial oxygen, and Tenzing Norgay's son Jamling, organisers said.

The strike - which closed shops and schools, and left roads largely deserted - started Wednesday and was marked Thursday with three small bomb blasts in the capital Katmandu.
No one was wounded in the explosions, which police blamed on the insurgents.
In a statement, the rebels' student arm, the All Nepal National Free Student Union, said it was ending the strike because of pleas from the public. It did not comment on the students who defied the strike order and voted in the elections.
The student union opposed the college polls because it had been banned in taking part in them after being labeled a terrorist organization by the government.
Life quickly returning to normal in the city after the statement was released.
Every political party in Nepal has a student wing contesting the college elections, a key indicator of each parties' support. The polls are deemed second in importance to parliamentary elections.
When the rebels and their supporters issue strike calls demanding that people stay home, they usually are successful because residents are afraid to defy what they consider a ruthless militant group.
The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The eight-year insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
Fighting has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August. The rebels walked out of peace talks and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.

 Baghdad Iraq: Filipino accountant Robert Tarongoy and a Nepalese kidnapped early this week by Iraqi militants have been released by their captors, the Arabic television station Al-Jazeera reported on Friday 5 November .
 Nepalese officials confirmed the report but government officials in Manila said Friday 5 November they have no information about Tarongoy being freed and are checking on the reports.
 The Doha, Qatar-based, satellite network did not give a source for its information, saying Tarongoy was freed after his wife appealed to the kidnappers for his release on the occasion of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.
Philippine Daily Inquirer web site, in English 6 Nov 04
Tarongoy's wife of two years also reminded his abductors that there are no longer any Filipino troops in the war-torn nation.
 ""Robert is a good man with deep respect for all Muslims,"" said Ivy Grace Tarongoy. ""My country, the Philippines, has no troops in Iraq. My husband and I wish only the best for the Iraqi people,"" she said in a video aired over Al-Jazeera.
 ""I ask that he be freed as a symbol of goodwill and friendship between the peoples of Iraq and the Philippines,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I do not see any more possible grievances that the kidnappers may have against the Philippine government.""
 Tarongoy, a 31-year-old accountant working for the Saudi Arabian Trading and Construction Co, a Riyadh-based company that provided catering and foodstuffs to the Iraqi army and others, was seized Monday along with an American, a Nepalese and three Iraqis by armed gunmen from their compound in Baghdad. The kidnappers later released two of the Iraqis.  passage omitted
 There have been no claims of responsibility and no demands made for the remaining hostages' release.  passage omitted
 ""We are verifying reports that a group has claimed responsibility in abducting Tarongoy. We are continuously monitoring,"" Overseas Workers Welfare Administration chief Marianito Roque told reporters.
 Roque said there had been no reports of demands from the kidnappers of Tarongoy and did not say if he knew which group was involved.
 Earlier, Gilberto Asuque, Department of Foreign Affairs DFA spokesperson, said the DFA's Crisis Management Team and the Philippine Embassy in Baghdad were activating all their contacts in Iraq to ascertain the whereabouts of the 31-year-old accountant.
 No deal
 In a later statement, Asuque stressed that the government ""has not, and will never enter into any arrangements that will prejudice the safety"" of Tarongoy. He declined to say why the DFA issued such a statement.
 US Ambassador Francis Ricciardone yesterday urged the Philippine government anew not to give in to demands of Iraqi insurgents.
 ""These are difficult situations. One can only pray and hope and be strong and, of course, never give in to terrorist demands,"" Ricciardone told reporters in Camp Aguinaldo.  passage omitted

The women carried placards reading ""Give equal rights to women"" and ""All women, let's unite"" as they demonstrated in front of parliament for around two hours.
""Parliament has already passed a resolution to incorporate one-third women in all activities carried out by the government but in practice we are totally ignored,"" said Astalaxmi Shakya, a parliamentarian from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
In the 205-member parliament, only 12 MPs are women, and of a 21-member cabinet, only one woman holds a post.
""Women have not been consulted during peace talks and the leaders have shown their irresponsible nature by forming committees containing a very small number of woman,"" said Urmila Aryal, state minister for women, children and social welfare.
""I have expressed my strong dissatisfaction with the prime minister and I will raise the issue at the next cabinet meeting,"" Nepal's only female cabinet member told AFP.
The recently reinstated parliament is to be dissolved following a landmark deal struck with rebel Maoists Friday.
A temporary constitution is being formed that will pave the way for an interim government to include the rebels, who have been waging a bloody insurgency since 1996.
Parliament reconvened at the end of April, after mass protests forced King Gyanendra to end 14 months of direct rule.
Female life expectancy in male-dominated Nepal is 60 and women's literacy rate is low at 34.9 per cent compared to 62.7 per cent for men.

The charge-sheet, running 10,667 pages, said nine of the 15 accused at large are Pakistani nationals, according to Naval Bajaj, Mumbai's deputy commissioner of police.
The remaining six are Indians who operate out of Pakistan and Nepal, Bajaj said.

 Kathmandu, 30 May: Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand today resigned from his post following mounting pressure from the major political parties. His resignation, which came a day after the parties warned to root out the monarchy, was submitted at the royal palace by one of his aides at around 10:00 a.m. local time According to the royal palace communique, Chand would continue to serve the post until the next PM takes over charge.
 Chand was nominated PM on 11 October last year, a week after his predecessor Sher Bahadur Deuba was sacked for his alleged failure to hold parliamentary elections on time. However, major parties refused to recognize Chand as PM and launched a movement for his replacement with an all-party government, comprised of the parties represented in the dissolved House of Representatives. Chand's resignation contradicts what he said in the past not to quit the post till an elected government replaced him.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 31 May 03
The causes behind Chand's resignation have been taken as a palace strategy to quell the ongoing movement that is gradually turning violent. King is reported to have asked Chand to quit during an audience on Thursday 29 May evening. Chand, however, denied any pressure from the palace to quit.
 Talking to reporters at his official residence in Baluwatar after his resignation, Chand said he decided to step down with an intention to open other options to put an end to the political impasse. ""I did not like to waste the valuable time of the country by sticking to the post,"" said Chand.
 Chand claimed that his government was functioning smoothly and achieving desired success in the field of restoring peace, curbing corruption and maintaining sound relations with the neighbouring countries. ""But non-cooperational attitude of the parties forced me to resign from the post.""
 Chand's resignation has come at a time when the government was carrying out a dialogue with the Maoist rebels, in a bid to end the seven-year long insurgency. He, however, said the peace process would not be affected by his resignation. ""Resignation of a person cannot affect the process, as the agreement to sit for dialogue had reached after enough considerations,"" said Chand. However he said the ball was now in the court of the parties who were trying to make a government.
 Chief Maoist negotiator Dr Babu Ram Bhattarai also asserted that the change in the government leadership would make no difference in the process. ""It is the government of the king. So whoever the king appoints as the PM, it will still be the king's government,"" Bhattarai told The Kathmandu Post.
 Government negotiating team spokesman Narayan Singh Pun said the present team of the government would be dissolved and a new government formed. Asked whether the next government would be able to resolve the problems in the country, Chand simply said: ""It must. Otherwise, it would be very unfortunate for the country and the people.""

""As the forthcoming peace talks with the Maoists will be mainly focussed on the major political issues, I appeal to all the party leaders in the disbanded parliament to come and discuss the political issues to be presented during the talks,"" Thapa told state-run television.
The official peace talks team aims to fix the date for the third round of peace talks with the Maoists as early as possible.
The party leaders from the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) and the Nepali Congress (NC) rejected the call to join peace talks outright Monday, and vowed to continue their struggle against the government.
""There is no point in joining the government's peace team on the appeal of prime minister Thapa as we are have been demanding his removal to form an all-party government,"" an NCP-UML source said.
""We also want the king to reinstate the dissolved house of representatives,"" the source said.
King Gyanendra on October 4 dissolved parliament, and dismissed an elected prime minister, replacing him with a royalist prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
The king then took the executive powers of the prime minister.
The agitating political parties have stepped up pressure on the king to reappoint the elected prime minister and return power to parliament.
Meanwhile, a Maoist source said two Maoist negotiators Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa are arriving in Kathmandu in the next 48 hours to hold talks with different party leaders concerning the proposed third round of negotiations.
""Only after fixing the date for the third round of peace talks, the leader and the convenor of the Maoist peace talks team Babu Ram Bhattarai will be arriving with other two members,"" the Maoist source said.
The Maoists would open a public relations office in Kathmandu to improve communication with the local populace after a date is set for peace talks to begin, he added.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed over 7,800 lives.
The two sides announced a truce in January this year and have so far held two rounds of talks but without any results.

Hindu extremists opposed to the secularization of Nepal, former Maoist rebels and an organization representing the Madeshi ethnic group are among the groups involved in clashes and other violence in the increasingly lawless region in recent months.
Militants from various groups have repeatedly threatened local journalists and accused them of ignoring their cause or writing in favor of the government, said Bishnu Nisthuri, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists.
Minor attacks also have been reported, including a bomb that was planted but did not explode at a news news organization this week, he said.
""The number of threats and warnings from various groups have increased significantly in the recent days. There is no sense of security for the journalists working in these areas,"" Nisthuri said.
On Monday, a bomb was planted in the regional office in Biratnagar of Kantipur Publications, the largest private news organization in Nepal, but it was later defused by army experts, he said.
A Hindu extremist group claimed responsibility, accusing the news organization of supporting supported Nepal government's decision to declare Nepal, a traditional Hindu state, as a secular nation.
In another incident earlier this week, Nisthuri said Maoist leaders threatened some local journalists in the southeastern town of Itahari after disagreeing with articles in their newspaper. The Maoists are former communist rebels who gave up their decade-old armed insurgency to join a peace process last year.
Other groups such as the Madeshi People's Right Forum, which is seeking greater autonomy in the southern region, also have threatened journalists, Nisthuri said.
The Madeshi and several smaller groups have been staging strikes, transport shutdowns and demonstrations since January.

  Though local NGOs claim that 22 tigers have been killed in Ranthambore in the past three years, Rajasthan police claims that 12 tigers were killed. 
The local police in arrested a village headman and his two associates on poaching charges in November. They had reportedly confessed to killing 12 tigers.
  Thereafter, Mohar Singh and his son Madho Singh were arrested. They had allegedly acted as conduits for international traffickers and had purchased tiger body parts from the poachers. Each tiger body part was sold for about Rs 5,00,000. Mohar Singh smuggled them via Delhi and Nepal. It is estimated that the entire animal's body parts would fetch about Rs 20 lakh in the international market.
  This is a second tiger reserve in Rajasthan where CBI inquiry has been ordered. In Sariksa poaching case, the CBI had arrested Sansar Chand for his alleged involvement. In Rantham bore also, Sansar Chand's name surfaced. The ministry has, however, broadened the scope of the CBI investigation. The ministry has asked CBI to investigate the possible connivance of forest department staff in poaching. The CBI will also look into the impact of land use changes in Ranthambore on tiger poaching.

The children, aged six to 22, were brought to Kerala from remote villages in Nepal by child traffickers who had paid bribes to their parents or simply abducted them, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement) activists said at a news conference.
Many of them had been working at the circus for 10-15 years and were brought to India at a very young age. Some of the girls were also sexually exploited.
The organisation's Kailash Satyarthy said the children were rescued last Saturday after a police seige on the ""Great Indian Circus"" in Palakkat district of Kerala, India's southernmost state which is at least 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) by train from Nepal.
""It was a very risky and dangerous operation,"" Satyarthy said. ""But the local administration helped us.""
""These children were made to do all sorts of dangerous stunts like jumping from great heights, climbing on bamboo poles, riding a motorcycle,"" Satyarthy said.
""If they looked scared while doing these feats, their keepers used to beat them. They were paid a measly allowance of 10-20 rupees (21-42 cents).""
As a result of the raid, the circus has been shut down and its organisers arrested, he said.
Sitting huddled together, the young boys and girls in colourful dresses, told gory stories of their days in captivity.
Satyarthy said one of the rescued girls, 10-year-old Basanti, who was not present at the news conference, was suffering from mental illness as she had suffered a seizure when she saw her parents after many years.
""She was also sexually assaulted by her masters,"" he said. ""Some of the children had also tried to escape but they were brutally beaten.""
Seven-year-old Shankar, who like most of the other children could not recall his surname, sat huddled on a chair, playing with his locks.
""They used to give us food full of stones,"" he complained, unable to recall how or when he was brought to the circus.
""I used to climb the bamboo (stick) and then rotate at the top,"" said the frail boy.
Nine-year-old Sukanya said that four years ago ""an old man"" had come to her village in Nepal and asked her parents to send her with him to the city for schooling.
""I went with him. It was many days later after many trains and buses that I reached the circus. First, I did not know what was happening but later on I realised what this was all about. I was made to wear dresses I did not like,"" she said.
Sukanya said she now wants to reunite with her family, study hard and ""become big"".
Rina, 11, was given away by her uncle who had received 3,000 rupees by the ""middlemen"". She was promised a ""great life, gymnastics and money"".
She performed three shows a day and was also made to do menial jobs like cleaning the toilets. Now she wants to see her parents, go to school and become a doctor.
According to Satyarthy, there are around 60 million child labourers in India with at least 10 million working as bonded labourers. Around 500 children work in 35 circus companies of the country. Most of them are young girls.

Malaysian police have tentatively identified the body found Sunday as that of Suresh Krishnakant Sharma, but are checking if he may actually be Balu Dokre, alias Kiran - a lieutenant of Bombay underworld don Chota Rajan - senior police officer Hadi Ho said.
Dokre is said to be high on the Bombay police's wanted list in connection with 43 criminal cases, including the killing of Nepalese lawmaker Mirza Dilshad in 1998, according to Indian media reports.
The Indian's body was found with his head almost severed in a field near the main road near Rawang town, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur, roughly 12 hours after his death. He had stab wounds and a knife was found in his chest.
Police have ruled out robbery as a motive, since the man's jewelry and cash were intact.
""We are investigating if this person is Balu Dokre,"" Hadi said. ""We will seek help from Interpol, and of course the Indian authorities."" He said investigators will also check if ""rival gangs"" killed the victim. He said there were no witnesses to the murder.
An Indian Embassy official said the victim's passport and a Malaysian identification card issued to foreigners identified him as Sharma, who purportedly worked for a mattress manufacturing company - but a police check found he was never employed there.
""The identity card is probably fake and we have sent his passport details to the issuing authority in Bombay to verify if it is genuine,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An autopsy was to be conducted Tuesday and no one has come forward to claim the body, said the official.
Malaysian newspapers on Tuesday carried photographs of a bearded Dokre and a clean-shaven Krishnakant. The two bore a close resemblance.
Indian newspapers have been reporting Dokre's slaying in Malaysia, quoting unidentified sources.
The Times of India newspaper said the killing was the work of rival Indian gangster Dawood Ibrahim, who directs his Bombay gang from Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Dokre's boss, Rajan, once was Ibrahim's right-hand man, but broke away and set up his own gang about 12 years ago.
Rajan, wanted in India over crimes including extortion and murder, survived an attempt on his life in 2000 while in hiding in Bangkok. He was seriously injured in the shooting, which he claimed was Ibrahim's handiwork. Rajan escaped from a Thai hospital, and his whereabouts remain unknown.

  Singh further said that the next stage would be to reach an Agreed Framework, adding that special representatives of the two Governments have so far held talks six times. 
  Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during Question Hour today, Singh said they would be meeting again for the seventh time in New Delhi and it would be at that stage of the talks that the question of delineation etc would be dealt with. 
  The states of Orissa and Bihar would be the biggest beneficiaries of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to be operational in 150 districts of the country, he added.
  Referring to the flood-prone states Singh said the Task Force was going into the entire gamut of inter-state linkages of the rivers, adding that the sensitivity of Nepal would be kept in view during the process. 
  The Sino-Indian boundary dispute dates back to the 1962 Sino- Indian War, when China seized a Switzerland-sized area, Aksai Chin (Aksayqin), and overran parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Relations only began to thaw in 1988. 
  On September 7, 1993, China and India signed an accord to reduce tensions along their border and to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In November 1996, China and India agreed to delimit the LAC and institute confidence-building measures (CBMs) along the frontier. The agreement pledged non-aggression, prior notification of large troop movements, a 10-km no-fly zone for combat aircraft, and exchange of maps to resolve disagreements about the precise location of the LAC.
  In August 1997 the sides ratified the CBM agreement. Since then, there has been no substantive progress, except for a series of high-level visits between leaders and officials of both sides
  China and India have yet to address their fundamental and very large land boundary disputes. Moreover, their bilateral relations are complicated by the issue of Tibet (Xizang). India plays host to the Dalai Lama and a large number of Tibetan refugees. They present an implicit threat to the Chinese control of Tibet, which it invaded in 1950.

The Ram-Janaki temple at Nijgadh town in Bara district south of Kathmandu was completed only a few months ago with financial contributions from locals, who have been enraged by Tuesday night's destruction, the source said.
In the other attack, a bus reserved for Buddhist pilgrims was set on fire when it was returning Tuesday from Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, by Maoist rebels who first ordered devotees to get off, the source said.
None of the Buddhist pilgrims was hurt although the bus was badly burnt.
""We were not told the reason for setting the bus on fire but it could be due to the fact it was used for the transportation of security personnel in the past,"" a commuter said.
In another incident, two rebels were killed in a clash with security forces Tuesday night in the Ghandruk area of western Nepal, the source said.
Security, meanwhile, has been beefed up in important trekking areas used by foreigners in the northwestern Himalayas, such as Dhaulagiri and Annapurna.
Suspected Maoists last week robbed five Belgian trekkers travelling in the area, a security source said.
The Maoist ""people's war"" has claimed more than 8,300 lives since 1996. Violence has surged since the rebels pulled out of a seven-month ceasefire in August.

 Kathmandu, 24 April: Nepal Bar Association [NBA] has demanded the resignation of Chief Justice Hari Prasad Sharma blaming him for making political statements in a foreign country. The NBA said Sharma's statement undermined the dignity of his office.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 25 Apr 05
The NBA has concluded that the chief justice's suppor for the action initiated by the Royal Commission for Corruption Control [RCCC] against a judge has hurt the supremacy of the constitution.
 The NBA, an umbrella organization of legal practitioners across the country, has been discussing the matter for two weeks. ""The chief justice cannot fulfil the responsibility of leading an independent judiciary and protecting the constitution, so it is not appropriate for him to remain in the position,"" an emergency meeting of NBA central committee has said.
 On 20 March, the chief justice at a function in Gold Coast, Australia, had said that ""the king made the 1 February move after the governments of political parties failed to face the problem of terrorism"". Law experts had been protesting the chief justice's address saying it was not in accordance with the dignity and norm of judiciary and his position.

""Terrorism, extremism, communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country. The recent terrorist attacks in Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and other parts of the country have shocked the nation. What words can I find to condemn such acts of barbarism. I share the sorrow and grief of people affected by terrorism. The Government of India will take concrete steps to rehabilitate and help such families,"" he said.
Stressing upon his Government's resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism, Dr. Singh appealed to the State Governments, all political parties, civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate in rooting out terrorism from the country.
He said initiatives are being taken to promote peace and stability in the North Eastern region and Jammu and Kashmir.
""We wish all our neighbours well. We welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood, especially in Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan. The recent blasts in our Embassy in Kabul (July 7) have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with Pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region. I have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the Government of Pakistan,"" he said.
""If this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated.

We must defeat them,"" he said.
Calling for the defeat of terrorism, the Prime Minister emphasized that terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of India and Pakistan and of peace in the region and the world.
""If this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated. Let us resolve today to stand together, to strengthen the unity and integrity of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new India of our dreams,"" he said.
""I commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication with which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances. But I agree that we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism,"" he added.
He also said that his government would examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and security forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this challenge.
""Whatever resources are required, will be provided. Whatever manpower is required will be provided. We are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism. I urge the State Governments, all political parties, civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate with us in rooting out terrorism from our country,"" he added.
""I am confident that we will overcome these challenges. But this requires hard work and unity of purpose. This requires a politics of consensus, not confrontation. This requires dialogue among communities, not discord. The challenge of communalism, of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided,"" he concluded.

The aircraft of state-owned Alliance Air was carrying 127 passengers from central India to New Delhi when the pilot flashed a hijack alert to air traffic control in the Indian capital.
Commandos surrounded the aircraft but then were told it was only an exercise, the second false alarm in as many months.
""We carried out the drill to check the alertness of security forces,"" Civil Aviation Secretary K. Roy Pal was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency.
On August 20, troops surrounded a plane at New Delhi's airport that was about to leave for troubled Indian-administered Kashmir after the pilot falsely alerted that the flight was being hijacked.
The 57 passengers and seven crew members were taken off the plane of state domestic carrier Indian Airlines but after the initial panic, authorities realised there was no security threat.
Indian airports have been heavily guarded since an Indian Airlines plane bound for New Delhi was hijacked in 1999 from Nepal's capital Kathmandu and taken to Afghanistan, then under the rule of the hardline Taliban regime.
The passengers of the plane bound for New Delhi were released after India agreed to release three prominent Islamic militants from its jails.

Biratnagar, 16 November: Taking into account the increasing incidents of crime in the eastern region, the government has deployed 854 more police personnel in the region, Deputy Inspector-General at the eastern regional police headquarters Ravindra Pratap Shah said.
The deployment has raised the number of police personnel in the eastern region to 10,235. Shah said that the force was augmented because of increasing incidents of crime in the region.
DIG Shah said a new riot control company has been posted in Pakali-Itahari of Sunsari District, while a police office at Sitagunj and a ward police office in Rajbiraj have been reinforced. The riot control company comprises 600 personnel led by a superintendent of police.
Police offices in Sitagunj, Rajbiraj and the Lahan area police office have together received a total of 70 new personnel. With the addition of three police posts in the region, the number of police units has gone up to 402.
The riot control company will also patrol the east-west highway and ensure there are no traffic obstructions, bandhs [protests] or strikes on the highway. It will also curb criminal and anti-social activities in the urban areas and the Terai [southern plains] region. Being a rapid action force, the company would be able to deploy its personnel promptly anywhere in its territory.
The additional police personnel include a superintendent, a deputy superintendent, 17 inspectors, 42 sub-inspectors, 55 assistant sub-inspectors, 137 head constables, 536 constables and 45 peons. Area police offices in Jhiljhile of Jhapa district, Pakali of Sunsari and Kalyanpur of Saptari districts have been upgraded from B to A category, said Inspector at the eastern region police office Roshan Acharya.
DIG Shah said the government took the decision to augment the eastern region police units in view of growing insecurity due to increasing incidents of terrorism, extremism, extortion, robbery, abduction and murder in the Terai. He added that the reinforcement would definitely help control crime there.
Interaction between the Nepal police and Indian police has also been stepped after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's recent observation that armed groups indulging in violence in the Terai were in contact with Indian extremist groups.

""All the students and teachers have been successfully rescued by the army,"" the security official, who requested anonymity, told AFP.
""There were no clashes with the rebels in the rescue operation.""
The students were rescued three kilometres south of Chaimale village located on the Kathmandu outskirts from where they were seized Sunday, he said.
Security forces had launched an intense search for the secondary students and teachers who were abducted from two schools in Chaimale just four kilometres (2.5 miles) from an army barracks.
The kidnappings by the Maoists, who have been waging a deadly ""People's War"" to overthrow the monarchy since 1996, were the first ever in the Kathmandu valley, authorities said.
Until last weekend, the rebels had kidnapped students only from the countryside and usually released them after trying to indoctrinate them.
The Maoists control vast swathes of the countryside, often operating their own administrations.
The latest kidnappings followed a wave of Maoist attacks in and around the capital that have been seen by analysts as a show of strength by the rebels who want to install a communist republic in the landlocked kingdom.
The rescue followed an announcement the previous day by Nepal's new coalition government that it wanted to hold peace talks with the rebels.
Government officials were in contact with rebel leaders in a bid to smooth the way for peace talks, sources said Monday, amid reports Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara was in Kathmandu.

 Text of report by Pallab Bhattacharya from New Delhi entitled: ""Delhi, Dhaka, Kathmandu sign deal to fight kala-azar"" by Bangladesh newspaper The Daily Star web site on 19 May
 India, Bangladesh and Nepal yesterday [18 May] signed an agreement to set up a task force for cooperation in eradicating kala-azar [tropical infectious disease], which affects about one lakh [one lakh is 100,000] people each year in the three countries.
 A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this regard was signed by the health ministers of the three countries at the 58th session of the World Health Assembly in Geneva.
The Daily Star web site, Dhaka, in English 19 May 05
Under the MoU, the tri-nation task force would ensure effective collaboration for resource mobilisation, exchange of information, and strengthening of intersectoral cooperation and research.
 The strategy would be based on access to early diagnosis and treatment, particularly of the most vulnerable groups, strengthening disease and vector surveillance, integrated vector management, social mobilisation and networking and research.
 While the fly-borne disease affects 100,000 people each year in these endemic countries, 147 million people are at risk, a release from the World Heath Organization (WHO) said here.
 The disease is transmitted by the bite of the infected female sand fly, Phlebotomus argentipes. In the endemic countries of the region, most cases are limited to 96 districts, half of them across the international borders.
 The estimated 100,000 cases of kala-azar in South East Asia constitute about 20 per cent of the global cases, the release said.

 Dailekh mid west Nepal , 7 August: You might not believe this. But even with their husbands still alive, women of Kalikot district mid west Nepal are forced to break their bangles off their hands.
 The Maoist rebels have started to break the bangles off the women hands and snatch away ornaments from women in the name of ending old traditions and establishing a new one. Following Maoists threats to compulsorily follow their orders, women of Kalikot district have been forced to take off their bangles and well as ornaments from their neck, nose and ears.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Aug 04
A resident of Chim Village of Pakha Village Development Committee Dutkala Malla, on her way to India fleeing the Maoists, said broken bangles were strewn across the village. ""If a stranger goes to the village, if would seem that all the males of the village have been killed. The Maoists have threatened to take action against anyone who defies their orders."" The Maoists have also publicly ordered the women to wear pants and coats as well as the Nepali traditional male dress ""duara surwal"".
 It is said that there is much resentment of the Maoist move to curtail cultural and traditional practices. Local people say the culture of Karnali region mid west Nepal is now in crisis because of the Maoist attempts to enforce communist practices.
 A teacher at the Shibalaya Lower Secondary School says tension is growing between the women, local people and the Maoists over the incident. He added that the women are not willing to put on men's clothing and the Maoists are preventing the women to wear their traditional dresses.
 Note: It is a tradition in Nepal for married women to wear bangles. Only after the death of her husband will a woman break her bangles as a sign of widowhood.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 18 April
Kathmandu, 18 April: Snubbed by Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Madhav Thapa turning down its summons, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Monday [17 April] sent a letter to the chief of the Armed Police Force (APF) requesting the latter to send Thapa to NHRC for interrogation on alleged use of ""excessive force"" in Gongabu last week.
In the letter sent to the inspector-general of the APF, Sahabir Thapa, NHRC has requested him to send SSP Thapa within 48 hours, according to an NHRC source.
The NHRC also said it would also take up the issue with Home Minister Kamal Thapa.
The national human rights watchdog had asked SSP Thapa to be present at its office in person on Sunday [16 April]. However, in a letter to the NHRC, the APF Headquarters said that he couldn't appear before the office due to ""hectic security meetings"".
Last Tuesday [11 April], armed policemen under the command of SSP Thapa allegedly had used ""excessive force"" to suppress demonstrators in Gongabu, injuring over 100 with rubber bullets and batons.
In its letter to the APF chief, the NHRC has said that, besides maintaining peace and security, ""it's the duty of the police officer to uphold human rights standards"", said the NHRC source.
Similarly, NHRC has also sent a letter to Inspector Ramesh Basnet ordering him to appear at the commission to take his statement in connection with the beating of journalists in a peaceful demonstration on Saturday [15 April]. NHRC has given Basnet a 48-hours deadline.
Meanwhile, Ian Martin, representative of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Nepal, has demanded investigations into the killing of demonstrators or bystanders in Pokhara,  Chitwan, Banepa and Parasi and the excessive use of force at Gongabu.
According to a press statement issued by OHCHR, Martin met the home ministry secretary on Monday [17 April] and raised serious concerns about human rights violations in the context of the policing of recent demonstrations and making arrests.
The OHCHR-Nepal chief, during the meeting, expressed his particular concern at the excessive use of force by members of the security forces at Gongabu and other places as witnessed by OHCHR staff, the statement read.
The statement added that Martin insisted on the authorities' legal obligation to use only the minimum force necessary in accordance with international standards on the use of force and firearms.

Text of report by Nepalese Kantipuronline.com website on 18 November
Kathmandu, 18 November: The Lumbini Zonal Administration Office (ZAO) [covering six districts in south-central Nepal] has mobilized all local bodies to foil a huge CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] mass rally, slated for Saturday [19 November] in Butwal, apparently in a bid to prevent the political parties from carrying out their political programmes at the local level, The Kathmandu Post reported on Friday [18 November]. 
The ZAO has circulated letters to all six district development committees (DDCs), asking them to mobilize all nominated members and ""nationalist"" groups to oppose and thwart the rally at any cost.
The letter also states that the UML, after talks between its leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Bamdev Gautam with the Maoist leadership in Rolpa District recently, has been coordinating with the rebels for people's democracy in the country, the report said.
""Since UML activists are on a village level campaign to make the demonstration a success, all DDC chairmen, vice-chairmen, area members, other nationalist forces and those who support the 1 February move [the king's assumption of full powers] have to be actively mobilized to free people from their 'fallacy',"" the letter stated.
The UML had announced that it would gather over 100,000 people in Butwal on 19 November.
Meanwhile, at a press meet in Butwal yesterday, the UML deplored the government move.
Meanwhile, a group claiming to be the ""civil society"" in Nawalparasi, has asked the public not to attend UML's demonstration. 
""As terrorists are still active and likely to infiltrate the mass meeting, we appeal to all not to participate in the Butwal gathering,"" read the pamphlet circulated by the group, the report added.
Similarly, the ""Nationalist Civil Society"" of Gulmi also urged all people not to participate in the rally. ""The mass rally called by the CPN-UML is against the constitutional spirit,"" said a statement released by the Civil Society.

"7425",20118436,"Title: Syria places 'severe' constraints on diplomats_ US.rtf; Date: August 6, 2011 Saturday; Text: SYRIA, Aug. 6 -- The United States has urged US citizens to depart Syria ""immediately,"" and noted that the Damascus government has placed ""severe"" constraints on the travel of US diplomats in the country.
The travel warning, an update to an April 25 order for US embassy staff's family members and some non-emergency personnel to leave Syria, expressed growing concern over the violent crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's security forces against pro-democracy protesters.
Last month, pro-government demonstrators attacked the US and French embassies in Damascus, smashing windows and spray-painting walls after the two Western envoys visited the flashpoint protest city of Hama.
""The US Department of State urges US citizens in Syria to depart immediately while commercial transportation is available,"" the latest travel warning said.
It said ""Syrian government constraints on observers, including the short-term detention of accredited diplomats, have made it difficult for US embassy personnel to adequately assess the current risks or the potential for continuing violence.""
Washington sent its ambassador back to Damascus on Thursday as it gradually cranked up the heat on Assad. Robert Ford had infuriated the Assad regime with his visit to Hama last month, but he has vowed to continue traveling around the country. French Ambassador Eric Chevallier also visited the city on July 7.
Syria responded by imposing a ban on the two envoys prohibiting them from traveling outside Damascus.
Noting that Syrian demonstrations have been ""violently suppressed"" since March, the State Department warned US citizens that ""demonstrations can occur with little or no warning anytime and anywhere, not just on Friday afternoons, as with many past demonstrations.""
""We remind US citizens that even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,"" it added. ""US citizens are urged to avoid the areas of demonstrations if possible, and to exercise caution if within the vicinity of a demonstration.""
""Syrian efforts to attribute the current civil unrest to external influences may lead to an increase in anti-foreigner sentiment,"" the State Department warned.
""Detained US citizens may find themselves subject to allegations of incitement or espionage.""
It said Syrian authorities often do not notify the US embassy of a US citizen's arrest until days or weeks later, and decline requests for consular access.

 The police, whose claims could not be independently confirmed, also said the six-hour battle left three policemen dead and several others injured.
The fighting took place at Kusum on the border between the Banke and Dang districts, about 500 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, after the rebels of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) attacked a police base, ending a nine-day unilateral cease-fire announced by the rebels for the Hindu festival of Dashain.
 The insurgents, fighting to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy, have of late intensified attacks on government positions, mainly targeting police outposts in remote regions of the kingdom.
 The Maoist insurgency, which began in 1996, has claimed the lives of more than 8,000 Nepalese so far.

The students were demanding the cancellation of a meeting Thursday of the Royal Council, an advisory body that the demonstrators claimed was aimed at granting the king additional powers.
The students from several colleges in Katmandu took to the streets blocking traffic and shouting slogans against the king.
The monarch has been the target of criticism since he fired an elected government and took over executive powers in 2002.
Despite reinstating Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba earlier this year, opposition political parties have regularly held protests against the king claiming not all democratic rights were restored.
Protesters have been demanding the king reopen parliament, which was dissolved in 2002, or order fresh elections.
They say Deuba's government has no power to initiate peace talks with Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since February 1996 for a communist state, leaving 10,000 dead.

One day in November, Mukesh Ambani decided to say ""I have differences with Anil"" to a television channel.The biggest business/family feud in the history of corporate India was out in the open.
  The five words were just the beginning. Internal e-mails were leaked by one side and then the other. One camp said that it had been sidelined surreptitiously.
  The other responded by saying Reliance's late patriarch, Dhirubhai Ambani, had settled ownership issues in his lifetime. As one side accused the other of making questionable investments, the other raised tricky corporate governance issues. There were even stories about the authenticity of one of the brothers' MBA degree. It was as if Reliance was in self-destruct mode.
  At no time did the brothers actually attack each other openly. Yes, they were washing their dirty linen in public, but they had left the job to the battery of spin doctors they each command to engineer the leaks and sow the plants.
  Corporate India was shocked - but not surprised, there were rumours that all wasn't well in the family. Within Reliance, heads rolled - and, in some cases, 'unrolled'. Shareholders were bewildered - Reliance's stock fell, though the market crossed the 6,000 point mark. As for the rest of us, we just watched as this fascinating story unfolded.
  The reasons we did that are many. Take the group itself. It has revenues of Rs 99,000 crore. That's approximately equal to the combined GDPs of Sri Lanka and Nepal and 3.5 per cent of India's GDP.
  Something of that size affects everybody - even in a country of one billion people.
  Reliance is also everywhere. From fuel to telephones to mutual funds to insurance to textiles - and lately, even politics. If one brother meets Sonia Gandhi, the other is a Samajwadi Party backed MP.
  People have speculated as to exactly what caused the rift. Is the battle for control of the company a result of several other differences between the brothers? Like their politics, for instance, their contrasting personalities - flamboyance versus reserve - or the word that their wives aren't the best of friends?
  Given the way the story is being scripted - chapters of oblique accusations followed by more of the same - we might well get the book in 2005.
  What we are also likely to get is a clear winner in the battle of the brothers. This is a zero sum game. Only one brother will control Reliance. But before that, there will be a bit of give and take - relinquishing a few thousand crores in shares here, or control of a company there. A few more surprises are assured in further installments of the story. As are at least as many shocks.

"3777",20053462,"Title: Nepalese paper urges parties to open dialogue with Maoists.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 6, 2005 Sunday
Excerpt from editorial report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 6 November
Expressing alarm at the possibility of alliance or collaboration between the major political parties and the Maoists, the USA has showed its disappointment with the informal talks continuing between the parties and the Maoists for the past few months. The US reaction is targeted at the Maoists who are continuing armed violence and not clear about entering the mainstream politics. The US has attempted to caution the parties over the possibility of the Maoists' using the parties as a ladder to get to the state governance through their collaboration in the movement against the king. The US estimation that the Maoists would capture the state governance is not only far-fetched but it could also discourage the parties' sense of responsibility that they should bring the Maoists to the political mainstream.
After the seven parties handed over their senior leaders the responsibility to hold talks with the Maoists, the leaders of especially the Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and their representatives have been holding talks with the Maoists at different levels and places, inside and possibly also outside the country. However, these two forces have strong reasons and backgrounds for mutual distrust and they are equally vague about their destination. In an attempt to build relations they have exchanged certain conditions over a certain period and as a result the Maoists declared a three-month cease-fire and the parties have begun to take their campaigns to the villages. This is just a beginning and this cannot be deemed immediately as collaboration. The parties in the course of the movement against the royal government have tried to bring the Maoists to the political mainstream but not to become the Maoists' accomplice or means. [passage omitted]
Since the Maoists need a political solution and the political parties need a constitutional solution, collaboration between the two to make a joint political draft of a democratic Nepal is gradually becoming inevitable. Dialogue would not be possible with the Maoists without a cease-fire, they would not lay down arms without holding a dialogue and political solution is not possible until they did not lay down the arms. So the main responsibility is on the parties to disarm the Maoists and make them agree to a political solution. [passage omitted]

""On Friday Prachanda will make a public appearance in the capital for the first time in 25 years. On that day we will unveil new Maoist party policies,"" said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, the rebel spokesman.
The rebels and multi-party government appeared close to a breakthrough in the six-month-old peace process Monday, after the Maoists announced that they were prepared to lock up their arms and place them under UN supervision.
""After all these political events there is a need for our party to have new policies,"" Mahara told journalists.
Later this month, Prachanda, the former teacher-turned-revolutionary whose name means ""the fierce one"", is expected to attend a two-day ""leadership Summit"" organised by the Hindustan Times in New Delhi
The event, expected to be attended by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi, would be the rebel leader's first international diplomatic outing.
Since declaring a ceasefire in May, the Maoists and government have held two rounds of high-level peace talks aimed at ending the conflict that has killed more than 12,500 people since 1996.

"51",20032583,"Title: Maoist leader in Nepal comes out of hiding.rtf; Date: March 28, 2003 Friday; Text: One of Nepal's top Maoist leaders, who has been in hiding for seven years, arrived in Kathmandu Friday, party sources said.
Babu Ram Bhattarai is the leader of the rebels' five-member negotiating team for peace talks with the government.
The Maoists and the government declared a ceasefire on January 29 and said they were willing to hold talks.
A date has not yet been fixed, but Bhattarai's arrival has raised hopes that negotiations could begin soon after King Gyanendra returns from a visit to India on Sunday.
Home Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa said Friday the government was making efforts to start the talks soon.
""There is will be no deception from the government's side and the talks will be held sincerely for peace to prevail in the country,"" he said at a public meeting.
Bhattarai went into hiding in February 1996 after the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" for a communist republic. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.
Bhattarai was accompanied by Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, the head of the People's Liberation Army of the Maoist party, and another senior rebel leader.
The party source said they travelled in a private bus to the capital from the town of Butwal, 390 kilometres (242 miles) west of Kathmandu.
Soon after their arrival, they held meetings with Maoist leaders already in Kathmandu to discuss the proposed talks.

"528",20032824,"Title: Talks between Nepal government and rebels come to grinding halt.rtf; Date: August 19, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Talks between the Nepalese government and Maoist rebels to end a seven-year insurgency came to a grinding halt Tuesday after negotiators failed to make headway on key points of dispute and amid a surge of violence.
""The third round of talks has been suspended but the ceasefire has not ended and it is still there,"" Communications and Information Minister Kamal Thapa announced to reporters here.
""The two sides have agreed to meet again for a fourth round of talks and the time and venue will be decided by the facilitators of both sides within a week.""
Thapa made it clear that talks had foundered on a rebel demand that elections be held for a constituent assembly that would redraw the country's constitution and redefine the role of the constitutional monarchy.
""The rebels insisted on constituent assembly elections to draft a new constitution whereas the government said the same constitution can be amended,"" Thapa said. ""The two sides could not come to an agreement on the subject.""
The third round of peace talks since a ceasefire was signed in January began on Sunday, but immediately faltered when the government rejected the rebels' constituent assembly demand.
Tuesday's session of talks, in the village of Hapure in southwestern Dang district -- a rebel stronghold -- began on an angry note when Maoist chief convenor Baburam Bhattarai lashed out over a weekend incident in which Nepalese troops killed 17 rebels in the country's east.
Some 7,800 people have been killed since the Maoists began their insurgency in 1996.
Maoist sources told AFP that Bhattarai had sought a government explanation for what he termed a ""one-sided action"" by the army in Toromba village in eastern Ramechhapt district.
""The army security along with … police had jointly searched the Maoists' camp and launched a sudden attack, killing at least 17 Maoist activists,"" the source said.
""The Maoist high command is very perturbed by this one-sided action … and if government cannot justify the army actions it may badly affect the peace dialogue.""
Earlier Tuesday, Bhattarai had warned that ""dark clouds"" were hanging over the peace process, though he did not specifically mention the Toromba incident.
Bhattarai confirmed the Maoists' unhappiness with the government stand on the constituent assembly and the future of the constitutional monarchy, which the rebels want dismantled to make way for a communist republic.
""The official working paper submitted to the Maoists (on Sunday) regards the constitutional monarchy as sacrosanct, whereas there is nothing in this world which is unchangeable,"" Bhattarai said in a statement before the day's session began.
""We have been demanding that the Royal army should be restructured but the old regime has been ignoring it.""
Human rights group INSEC said Tuesday that a total of 76 people have been killed in armed clashes since the ceasefire was declared in January.
After months of calm, violence flared anew over a May 8 agreement reached during the second round of talks that police and soldiers will remain within a zone five kilometres (three miles) from their barracks.
The rebels have made it clear they regard security force patrols outside the zones as legitimate targets.
The government, however, says the police and army only move outside the defined zones when the security of the country demands this.

At least 25 people died in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim after the 6.9 magnitude quake hit the region Sunday evening, police said.
Paramilitary soldiers had pulled out 18 bodies and had located seven others buried under mounds of concrete in Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, said police Chief Jasbir Singh.
Another 11 people were killed the neighboring Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal. Seven people died in Nepal and China's official Xinhua news agency reported seven deaths from Tibet.
Most of the deaths occurred when houses, already weakened from recent monsoon rains, collapsed due to the force of the quake, which was centered in Sikkim near India's border with Nepal.
Heavy rains and landslides hampered rescue workers as they worked through the night to pull people from under the rubble, Singh said.
Much of the damage was not immediately known because the region is remote and sparsely populated.

 Kathmandu: Suspecting that the ban imposed on the Maoists might be in contravention with the constitution, the Supreme Court on Friday 24 September issued a notice to the Office of the Prime Minister and the office of the Council of Ministers asking to justify the ban on the Maoist activities.
 The single bench of Justice Balaram KC has stated that the writ filed at the court has raised various questions regarding the ban on the Maoists and such questions can be a subject for judicial review. The bench has ordered the Office of the Prime Minister and the cabinet to furnish justifications regarding the ban.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 25 Sep 04
The Supreme Court asked the government to clarify its position on this issue by furnishing written replies within 15 days after completing preliminary hearings on the writ. The writ was filed by Taranath Ghimire, a permanent resident of Khartamchha-3 of Bhojpur district east Nepal .
 The writ demands the scrapping of the decision that declared the Maoists as terrorists in August last year in an ""unconstitutional manner"". The writ states that Article 112 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990 has prohibited to put a ban on political parties.
 However, the Supreme Court has clarified that the terrorist tag given to the Maoists cannot be a subject of judicial review. The writ has also sought the immediate removal of the terrorist tag given to the Maoists.
 Similarly, the Supreme Court has made it clear that judicial review does not apply to the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Control and Prevention ordinance. The writ has demanded the scrapping of the ordinance, claiming that it was promulgated against the rights of equality as stated in the Clause 2 and 3 of Article 11 of the constitution.
