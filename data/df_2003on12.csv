     The Times of India:
    --Flickers of hope jostled with entrenched cynicism in the  Valley as the first batch of troops to be withdrawn from Jammu and Kashmir will start leaving Anantnage on Wednesday around the time  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh touches down on his maiden  visit to the state. 
One commander said the first platoon of troops would leave the Kashmir valley at 10 am.

    -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will start his India visit  on December 3.

Moscow is working hard on attracting IT companies to invest in a big way in Russia and has been pressing for greater  cooperation in this sector.
     The Statesman:
    -- The festival season turned grim for Nepal as fresh violence  erupted in the country Tuesday, as at least 49 people, including  11 security personnel were killed in renewed clashes between  Nepalese forces and rebels in a jungle area, 700 km west of  Kathmandu.

    ""There are still reasons for grave concerns about the  humanitarian and human rights situation in Nepal, which is not a  humanitarian crisis in the usual sense,"" Walter Kalin,  representative of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, told reporters  at the end of his 10-day mission to Nepal.
    Kalin's team visited Kaplivastu, Banke, Dailekh and Morang  districts to assess the human rights situation with regard to the  IDPs in the Himalayan kingdom.
    He noted his mission has found a widespread pattern of conflict- based displacement in Nepal, and the number of IDPs should be far  higher than the official figure of 8,000.
    The main causes of this population displacement are acts of  violence or threats, practices of forced recruitment and extortion by the armed anti-government group, he said.
    He called on the guerrillas to respect the basic principles of  international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental  distinction between combatants and non-combatants.
    The mission also recommended the United Nations and the  international community to collaborate with the Nepali government  to draw up a comprehensive strategy and create a framework to  respond to the human rights and humanitarian needs of the IDPs.

    The leaders agreed to meet again on Wednesday.
    A source said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala is likely to issue a statement, aimed at tackling the Terai crisis, following  the eight-party agreement on Terai crisis.
    The eight-party meeting is likely to reach an agreement to  address the Terai crisis through amendment to the interim  constitution to ensure federal state structure and proportional  representation in the upcoming constituent assembly elections, the two key demands put forward by the Madhesi community. 
    The interim constitution was promulgated on Jan. 15.
    Monday's meeting of the top leaders of the four major parties,  Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the Communist Party of Nepal (formerly known as guerrilla) and Nepali Congress ( Democratic), had asked the Prime Minister to address the Terai  crisis at the earliest.
    The violent demonstrations, led by Madhesi community since Jan. 19, have caused more than 20 people's death. Many Terai towns  witnessed curfews, strikes and widespread vandalism of public and  private property in the unrest since then.
    Madhesi people are people mainly living in Nepal's south Terai  plains with Indian origin.

 Kathmandu, 29 November: The Thapa government is open to the idea of calling in UN experts to monitor the human rights scene in Nepal.
 National Human Rights Commission member Sushil Pyakurel told this daily that the cabinet secretariat has already passed a recommendation to invite foreign rights experts. It has been sent to the Foreign Ministry, he added.
The Himalayan Times, Kathmandu, in English 30 Nov 03
The UN experts can identify the problems, provide the government with feedback and suggestions and point out areas where the state needs technical and financial support, Pyakurel said.
 For long, human rights bodies have been clamouring for such a step in view of the ""appalling"" human rights violations by the security forces and the Maoists fighting the government.
 Although both the state and non-state actors have been accused of gross human rights violations, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has so far received more cases against the state than the Maoists. The number is growing particularly after the termination of the cease-fire.
 However, cases of abduction, disappearance, torture and killings from both sides are alarming, said Pyakurel, stressing that such matters need immediate attention. On the one hand, the security forces forcibly detain individuals who are reportedly tortured and some have even died while in detention.
 Time and again, the Maoists abduct people, take the law into their own hands and carry out ""summary execution"" which is against the human rights principle. ""The government and Maoists are killing people in a country which has no provision for capital punishment,"" said Pyakurel.
 ""An effective monitoring system to monitor the human rights situation is necessary, for which we need cooperation and commitment from both the state and the non-state actors,"" said Pyakurel. Once both the parties sign the human rights accord drafted by NHRC, the United Nations Office of the Commissioner has committed to provide the commission with technical assistance to effectively monitor the country's situation.
 The UN experts can identify the problems, provide the government with feedback and suggestions and point out the areas where the state needs technical and financial support.
 Following the Maoists' withdrawal of the cease-fire, NHRC has received around 187 cases against the government, a majority of the complaints are on forceful detention while some are concerning fake encounters, killings and torture in detention. Likewise, the commission has received around 32 complaints against the Maoists, mostly on abduction and a few on lootings and torture.  passage omitted

 In an open letter to US Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai has asked him not to interfere in Nepal's internal affairs and let Nepalis determine their own destiny. This was stated in an eight-point letter sent on behalf of the International Department Wednesday 24 September in response to Malinowski's statements and interviews.
 Saying that charges are not baseless, Dr Bhattarai's letter says that the USA put Maoists on their terrorist list on 25 April when dates for the first phase of the talks between the government and Maoists had been announced for 27 April; a five-year counter-terrorism agreement was signed; military aid was increased from 24 million to 38 million rupees; and the Royal Nepal Army was given sophisticated weapons while training was enhanced.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 25 Sep 03 p1
""Actions speak louder than words; your actions and words do not match,"" the letter said, while reacting to Malinowski's charges that Maoists were acting like Goebbels.
 The letter says that US support for the government concept paper presented during peace talks did not address the issues raised by five opposition parties and supports the 4 October 2002 move of the king to dismiss the government of Sher Bahadur Deuba .
 The letter says: ""A constituent assembly is not a communist slogan. If an interim government is formed and free elections held for a constituent assembly, we are ready to suspend the war. Is the Royal Palace ready for this?"" passage omitted
 The letter says the death of student Dipak Gurung 8 September was not planned and the party has expressed regret for his death in a bomb blast in Kathmandu .
 Reacting to American claims that the Maoists do not have popular support, the letter says 50,000 to 100,000 people attended their public meetings in the last seven months. The letter makes a special request to the USA and neighbours India and China not to interfere in Nepal's internal affairs.

 Kathmandu, 14 December: It has come to light that the rebel Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) believes a republic will emerge in Nepal if Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala and CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist-Leninist General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal are ready to go to jail temporarily.
 UML leader Pradip Gyawali said Maoist leader Prachanda proposed this to General Secretary Madhav Nepal.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 15 Dec 03 p1""We will prepare the atmosphere to bring about a republic in Nepal. Girija Prasad Koirala and you should be prepared to stay in jail for some time. But our party did not accept the proposal and appealed to the Maoists to return to the peaceful political mainstream.""
 Gyawali said Nepal told Prachanda the CPN-UML will support a demand for a constituent assembly if Maoists abandon their weapons and are ready to defend the gains of the popular movement of 1990 which brought about democracy .
 Gyawali believes the king should move two steps back, the political parties two steps forward and the Maoists two steps back to resolve the current political crisis in the country. He said this on Sunday 14 December at a meeting of the Rajdhani Correspondents' Club.
 Speaking at the same meeting, Nepali Congress Arjun Narsingh K.C. said the movement against regression i.e. for the restoration of an elected government will be effective and decisive in three months.
 ""The movement will be decisive in three months,"" K.C. said. ""The movement cannot be decisive instantly."" He said party activists are pressing him to stand against the king.
 ""It is certain that the king will be in a difficult situation if he does not think. It will be unpleasant if parliament goes against the king,"" former minister Dhundiraj Shastri said.  passage omitted

 Kathmandu, 29 November: Daman Nath Dhungana, one of the framers of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990, has reiterated that there is no alternative but to go for a constituent assembly to solve the nation's conflict. He said that as long as the demand and call for a constituent assembly that had been going on since 1950 as received is not fulfilled, the conflict will continue.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 30 Nov 03 p 1
Senior advocate Dhungana made the observation while speaking at the second general meeting of the Civic Solidarity for Peace campaign in the capital city on Saturday.
 Dhungana, while reiterating his earlier position that the constituent assembly is the only way to solve the frequent attacks on the democratic process in Nepal, said ""the Maoists may be erased, but the demand for a constituent assembly cannot be erased"".
 Dhungana, who was a facilitator during the talks between the government and the rebellious Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), said that since there is no alternative to a constituent assembly, the present need is to put pressure on the Maoists to make public their ""model"" of a constituent assembly before the people. He further claimed that unless an understanding is reached on the issue of the main bone of contention so far with the rebellious Maoists, even if another round of talks are held it would only result in a short cease-fire and no concrete results would be achieved.  passage omitted

    The 65 photographs of the pillars, taken by Tim Harward, co- director at Cambridge University in Britain, are being exhibited  on Sept. 16-24 in the Siddhartha Art Gallery in Kathmandu.
    This is the first time such historic pillars were discovered in Nepal and neighboring India's Kumaon and Garwhal, a guide at the  gallery told Xinhua Monday.
    ""It took Tim Harward seven years to complete his search of  these 185 pillars,"" said Anital Sharma, adding that Harward has  been working in Nepal and India since 1998 on the origins and  history of the Malla kings of western Nepal.
    In mid-western Nepal, the majority of pillar stones are to be  found along the ancient trade route linking Nepal's western city  of Nepalgunj and China's Tibet Autonomous Region, she noted.
    In their long lives of 400 to 900 years, the pillars have been  moved from time to time, she said, adding, ""It is quite possible  and natural that many have been taken from where they were  originally sited as landmarks for the heroic act to end up near  public meeting places.""

    Security has been beefed up along all the highways linking the  capital with other parts of the country and special teams of  commandos have been mobilized in strategic areas to foil possible  attacks from the guerrillas, Thapa said.
    No untoward incident has been reported so far, he added.
    Nevertheless, there were still several other drivers who didn't want to take risks and remained off the road fearing the  guerrillas' attacks, the independent English-language daily said.
    The guerrillas have threatened to impose a three-week economic  blockade targeting the capital from Aug. 18.
    The anti-government guerrillas have intensified their violent  activities across Nepal in recent weeks. Nearly 10,000 Nepalese  people have lost their lives since the anti-government insurgency  broke out in the Himalayan kingdom in early 1996.

    Besides holding talks in New Delhi with President A.P.J. Abdul  Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, External Affairs Minister K. Natwar Singh, Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Home Minister  Shivraj Patil, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi and Leader of  Opposition L.K. Advani, the King will also meet chief ministers of four Indian states -- Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West  Bengal that have a high concentration of Nepalese migrants. 
    This is the first time that a visiting head of state from Nepal will also be meeting state leaders along with federal heads.
    India and Nepal, two neighboring countries, enjoy a friendly  relationship for many years defined as much by geography and  history as by culture. 
    The royal couple will usher in the new year in Kolkata, their  last port of call, flying in there from Bodh Gaya in Bihar on Dec. 31 and departing for Kathmandu on Jan. 2.
    Local observers said that the king, accompanied by Queen Komal  and Nepalese Home Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka, would meet with  the leaders of the four neighboring states to discuss the anti- government insurgency in the kingdom, sharing of water resources  and other bilateral issues such as trade and commerce.
    The Indian government has said that insurgency was a ""common  threat"" to the security of the two countries. The insurgency has  killed 11,000 people since it erupted in Nepal eight years ago. 
    Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran recently called on the  Nepalese government to bring the rebels back to the negotiating  table.
    The rebels, who have been fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy  with a republic since 1996, last month rejected a January deadline set by the government to renew peace talks that collapsed in 2003.
    India's security concerns became pronounced when smugglers,  militants, terrorists and criminals misused its open border with  Nepal. 
    Reports appearing in the Nepalese media said King Gyanendra  would press for more support from India in the form of weapons and equipment to help Nepal fight rebels. The Royal Nepalese Army is  in need of arms and equipment to fight the insurgents who have  stepped up attacks in the recent past. 
    Some diplomats said that the Indian government would ask Nepal  to focus on counter-insurgency operations against the rebels, as  insurgency threatens to spill over into India. 
    Nepal is one of the least developed nations in the world with  42 percent of its population living below the poverty line. The  country's gross domestic product was estimated at 1,400 US dollars for each citizen this year.

    The newly launched railway will promote the integration of  Tibet with the interior of China and help pave the way for trade  between the country and India and Nepal and other southern Asian  nations to expand more conveniently, according to Wei Houkai,  director of the research center for development of western regions under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
    ""The railway will shorten Tibet's distance to the world,"" he  said.   
    Ratna Kumar Tuladhar, a 45-year-old businessman from Nepal,  sells silver ware, statues of Buddha and Thangka, traditional  Himalayan-style arts work, at Bakor Street in Lhasa, the capital  city of Tibet. 
    After the Qinghai-Tibet railway opened to traffic, he would  take the train to purchase a batch of cheap and fine electronic  gadgets in the hinterland of China for future sale in Nepal,  Tuladhar said.
    ""In inland China, I will recruit some agents for arts and  crafts commodities with Nepalese characteristics. Now I don't need to make a detour by marine route to get to China for my export  business. The new railroad allow me much easier access to the  Chinese hinterland,"" he added.
    Avinash Datta, who works for Mahindra company, one of the top  10 biggest enterprises in India, said that he felt exciting when  hearing the completion of the railway.
    He said that the railway will help improve Tibet's agricultural production and create a bigger market for investors from India.
    Before the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet railway, Tibet was linked with the rest of China by several highways and air routes.  The railway will shorten the travel time, and at the same time, it means much lowered cost of transport. 
    In July, besides the newly launched history-making railway,  Nyingchi, southeast of Lhasa, will open the region's third airport. Meanwhile, China and India will reopen, after 44 years' closure,  border trade at the Nathu La Pass, which perches on the border  between the Sikkim section of India and Yadong County in Xigaze  Prefecture of Tibet.
    Yadong is one of major border ports in Tibet. Although it  locates 460 kilometers away southwest from Lhasa, local government sources said that the railway with the destination in Lhasa would  bring more and better goods to this area.
    The Tibetan county is 300 kilometers from Bhutan's capital city of Thimbu, and 600 kilometers from Dacca, capital of Bengal. In  addition to that, the connection point of a railway network in  India is only dozens of kilometers from the port. 
     Compared with those ""big businessmen who travel by air"", the  merchants on the Sino-Indian border who trudge on the rugged road  of Himalaya with horses or yaks all year round are extremely eager to see the improvement of traffic in Tibet. 
    In the trade market of Pran, a small Indian county on the  juncture of Nepal, India and China's Tibet, 54-year-old Indian  businessman Singh was trading with Tibetans. ""We like to trade  with businessmen in Tibet,"" he said, ""their income has increased  greatly in recent years and they have big requirements.""
    To Singh's satisfaction, textiles, handicrafts like bronze ware and commodities like perfume are selling well.
    The dark-skin businessman predicts that the operation of the  Qinghai-Tibet Railway would greatly accelerate economic and trade  developments in Pran, although it is 1,300 kilometers away from  Tibet's capital city of Lhasa.  
    China has vowed to build a railway network to connect different parts of Tibet after the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet railway. 
    ""The Qinghai-Tibet Railway is not just a big deal for the  Chinese,"" said Singh.     
    According to Hao Peng, vice governor of Tibet who is in charge  of commerce, the autonomous region's foreign trade stood at only  200 million U.S. dollars last year. Upon the reopening of Sino- Indian border trade, the total foreign trade volume will increase  by several billion U.S. dollars annually.
    With the reopening of Nathu La Pass, iron ore and livestock  products from India and wool, silk, cashmere, herbal medicine and  electric appliances from China can be transported into the other  country through the short cut, trade observers said.
    ""The resumption of border trade is a great historic event, not  only for enlarging trade, but also for greater relations between  the two great countries,"" said Dr. Christy Fernandez, additional  secretary of the Indian Department of Commerce.
    ""China's strategy to develop its western regions and the  launching of the Qinghai-Tibet railway imply that it is a long- term trend for China and India to surmount various difficulties to expand economic cooperation through utilization of geographic  advantages,""said Prof. Liu Jiangyong with "

    The Mustang region, which opened to foreigners in 1992 is a  visually stunning but often dry and harsh alpine terrain adjoining China's Tibet which is considered as the trans-Himalayan desert  area.  
    The team comprising American, Italian and Nepali archaeologists and explorers, following the lead of local shepherds who took  shelter in one of those caves joined the expedition to uncover  those cave complexes said to contain fascinating Buddhist mural.  The archaeologists of the team believed that the exiting finding  they uncovered dates between 13th and 14th century.
    Talking to Xinhua here on Sunday, Prakash Darnal, the Chief  Archeology Officer of the Culture Preservation and Promotion  Division at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation  and one of the team member responsible in uncovering the caves  said this is the first time that such archeological expedition was carried out in the Upper Mustang region after being allowed to  foreigners.
    The expedition was participated by two Nepali archaeologists  including Darnal and Sukra Sagar Shrestha who also worked as  liaison officer on behalf of the government of Nepal. 
    Chief Archeology Officer Darnal expressed the view that the  caves they have found at Choser area in Upper Mustang still  remained intact till the date due to its location which is  virtually inaccessible to human beings.
    He, however, declined to reveal the exact location of the caves as treasure hunters might ransack those cave as it had happened in the past.
    Among the findings they uncovered inside the caves comprised  decorative wall motifs seen nowhere else in Asia, different types  of China's Tibetan scripts executed in ink, silver and gold along  with pre-Christian era pottery shred, according to Nepali  archaeologists. 
    Archeologist Darnal said that the locals recalled of such  historic monuments which were never been documented by anybody but were being told as folklore by generation to generation in the  villages. The elders of the area could relate large number of such monuments in the area which were forgotten by the present  generation.
    ""But the elders of the region confirmed that every settlement  in the region had similar caves which were apparently reserved as  an assembly room for Buddhist teachings,"" he said.
    He said that the findings could just be a window as they found  several holes in single caves. ""We found clusters of at least 40- 50 smaller chambers inside a single cave and there is possibility  that the caves are interrelated from within,"" he added.
     Although the exact reason and people responsible in drawing  such magnificent mural can not be confirmed right now, the  archaeologists involved in the expedition expressed the view that  the caves could have been used by the pilgrims crossing Nepal- China border for meditation as the caves are located near  Mansarovar lake, a popular pilgrimage among Nepali and Indians  Buddhists as well as Hindus situated in China. 
    ""Among 18-20 passes used by the travelers to cross Nepal-China  border, only the Mustang has the pass which could be used  throughout the year. Most of the passes remain inaccessible due to harsh climatic condition,"" said Darnal.
    Prior to this, during a research jointly carried out by Cologne and Bonn Universities at lower Mustang, various objects including  stone tools and pottery shreds were found which dated back some 2, 800 years. According to archaeologist Shrestha, they conducted  expedition in lower Mustang because foreigners were not allowed to travel upper Mustang then.
    Meanwhile, Broughton Coburn, an environmental and cultural  conservation expert who returned to Kathmandu from the expedition  earlier this week told reporters, ""we felt that it was unusual  that a wall painting as intricate and delicately executed and  intact could be found for the first time in this millennia.""
    The team assisted by two world-class mountaineers braved the  rigors of Mustang with average altitude of 4,500 meters and gale- force winds using custom made prototypical climbing tools to  anchor the team to the poor quality, crumbling rock at the cave to find the cave complexes containing a stunning, seven-meter long  mural. 
    ""I can unequivocally say that climbing the caves was greatly  more exciting than any emotions I had on Mt. Everest (Qomolangma), "" said Pete Athens, a leading mountaineer who successfully scaled  the Mt. Qomolongma seven times. Sharing his experience about the  expedition with the media, Athens said that leading the climbs  into the previously unexplored territory knocked the experience of climbing Mt. Qomolongma into the shades.

    Madhesi Tiger (MT) cadres, who are waging struggle to declare  independent Terai state, Wednesday night abducted 11 civilians  from Koshi Tappu, Saptari district, which is some 250 km southeast of the capital Kathmandu.
    The Armed group led by MT district in-charge Arjun has claimed  the responsibility for the abductions.
    In July 2004, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M)  accused its platoon commander Shambhu Yadav of misappropriating  party funds. Yadav later severed with CPN-M and set up the Madhesi Tiger group, a small armed outfit active in parts of Terai plains.

    Liu made the remarks when commenting on the recent detention of  Tibetan separatists in Nepal by the local police. 
    The adoption of necessary and just measures by Nepal shows the  country's responsible attitude in this regard, Liu said. 
    He said some Tibetan separatists, using violence and threats,  thronged  the Chinese embassy in Nepal to impair China's  interests, attempting to separate Tibet from the Chinese  territory. 
    Last Friday, Nepali police detained about 100 Tibetan  separatists in the Nepali capital of Kathmandu, who tried to  throng the visa office of the Chinese Embassy beside a street  choked with heavy traffic, shouting anti-China and ""Tibet  Independence"" slogans. 
    Liu said China did not accept the accusation by the group Human  Rights Watch of exerting pressure on Nepal to make arrests. 
    China was critical of this accusation, Liu noted. 
    Nepal is a friendly neighbor of China, Liu said, noting that  China does not exert pressure on friends and good neighbors, and  exerting pressure is not a foreign policy of China.

    BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts on journalism and  communications have expressed disappointment with some western  media's distorted reports on the riot in Lhasa and urged them to  replace those reports with truthful accounts. 
    ""They should make corrections and report more objectively,""  said Guan Shijie, professor at the School of Journalism and  Communications of Peking University. 
    In recent days, some western media organizations were  criticized by Chinese netizens for distorted coverage of the  violence in the capital city of China's Tibet Autonomous Region. 
    Guan said that he had noticed the website of Germany's largest  newspaper, BILD, published a picture of Nepalese police dispelling  Tibetan protestors with sticks; however, the newspaper said it  happened in Tibet. 
    He said the headline beside the picture -- ""Should we boycott  2008 Olympics in China together?"" -- exposed the newspaper's  purpose. 
    ""Some western media felt no hesitation in spreading rumors to  undermine the coming Olympics,"" he said. He added that, in the  long run, the western media want to take advantage of the riot to  tarnish China's image to serve their own political interests. 
    He said that distorted reports violated global media ethics and  severely damaged China's reputation in the international  community, since it was difficult to erase readers' first  impressions. 
    He urged such media organizations to make corrections and take  responsibility for what they presented to readers. ""Freedom of the  press should not hamper the freedom and dignity of other people,""  he said. 
    Zhang Kai, professor of the Communication University of China  (CUC), concurred with Guan. She said she had been paying attention  to reports both in China and abroad since the riot on March 14 and  seen some distorted and even fabricated reports. 
    The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) released a picture  on its website showing Chinese Armed Police officers helping  medical staff move a wounded person into an ambulance. 
    The website's caption said that ""there is a heavy military  presence in Lhasa"", neglecting the obvious First Aid and Red Cross  signs on the ambulance. 
    ""I was angered, as a media researcher, by their reporting,""  Zhang said. 
    German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost posted a picture on its  website that depicted police in Lhasa rescuing a young man  assaulted by rioters. But the caption said ""insurrectionist taken  away by police"". 
    U.S.-based Fox TV said in a picture caption on its website that  Chinese military personnel dragged some protestors onto a vehicle,  when actually the uniformed people were Indian police. 
    N-TV, headquartered in Germany, used TV footage showing police  with captured protestors in a report on the Tibet riots. The  footage had been shot in Nepal and the police were Nepalese. 
    Zhang said that in these cases, newspapers and TV stations  obviously chose materials according to their pre-conceived ideas.  When they failed to find ""proper"" materials, they used something  else instead. 
    ""They violated the fundamental journalistic principle of  'truth',"" she said. 
    Working at a Tianjin TV station, He Hua said she understood the  great visual impact that pictures and TV footage had on readers  and audiences. 
    She said a New York Times story that mentioned the riot in  Tibet used a picture of Nepalese police and protesters. This would  definitely mislead the public, not to mention reports directly  confusing Nepalese and Indian police with Chinese. 
    ""I was ashamed for my western counterparts,"" she said. 
    Yang Jing, graduate student in the international communication  school of CUC, said she was disappointed by the western media,  which she used to appreciate and respect for their objectivity and  fairness. 
    ""When some major events happened, I used to check how they  reported them and listen to their opinions. However, their good  image collapsed in my mind due to this incident,"" she said. 
    According to official statistics, at least 18 civilians and one  police officer have been confirmed killed in the Lhasa unrest,  which also saw 624 injuries. Damage is estimated at more than 244  million yuan (about 34 million U.S. dollars).

    Amidst tense situation, local administration has imposed 13- hour curfew in Bara and Parsa districts, situated some 80 km and  90 km respectively from capital Kathmandu, Monday afternoon to  contain possible clashes, reported the local media house's website eKantipur.
    The indefinite curfew clamped in Banke district headquarters  Nepalgunj, situated some 320 km southwest of Kathmandu, by the  district administration since Sunday afternoon is still continuing.
    In Siraha district, situated some 150 km south of Kathmandu,  educational institutions, industries, bazaars, all remained closed. Protestors torched a passenger bus along the east-west highway for defying strike early Monday morning, reported the leading media  house's website THT online.
    Life across the Terai districts remains tense for the last six  days due to the indefinite strike called by the United Democratic  Madhesi Front (UDMF) and the Federal Republican National Front.  The strike across the southern plains has hit the capital hard  with the shutdown of the only route to bring in petrol, diesel,  cooking gas and kerosene to the country from the sole supplier  India.
    Earlier on Feb. 9, three major agitating Madhesi groups-  Mahanta Thakur's Terai-Madhes Democratic Party (TMDP), Rajendra  Mahato's Sadbhawana Party and Upendra Yadav's Madhesi People's  Rights Forum (MPRF) formed a new alliance- United Democratic  Madhesi Front (UDMF)--  and announced to take to the streets to  press for its 6-point demand.
    Frequent strikes in the restive Terai have thrown the twice- deferred Constituent Assembly (CA) elections into uncertainty.
    Madhesi people are the Nepalese mainly living in south Nepal's  Terai plains, who are socio-culturally close to the bordering  Indians. Madhesi movement is protesting for political interest  satisfied before the CA elections slated on April 10.

    ""Some arms monitors are leaving ahead of time but UNMIN will  continue to have its presence till the end of its mandate,"" said  Kosmos Biswokarma, UNMIN spokesperson. 
     Meanwhile, UCPN-M has been appealing that the UNMIN should  stay in the country, citing that the peace process could be at  peril in absence of UNMIN. 
    Talking to Xinhua, Om Sharma, former Press Advisor to the then  Prime Minister Pushpa Kama Dahal alias Prachanda, and General  Secretary of Nepal Revolutionary Journalists' Association (NRJA)  said that UNMIN's role in Nepal is still very vital. 
    ""They should not leave the country without giving a concrete  end to the peace process,"" he said. 
    ""The nation is not ready to face the vacuum created in UNMIN's  absence,"" Sharma said. 
    He blamed the anti-nationalist forces for trying to act against  the peace process 
    ""The nation is still in a difficult conjuncture, it is not  right for the government to send UNMIN away at this point of time,  "" Sharma reiterated. 
    Spokesperson of the government and Minister for Information and  Communication Shankar Pokharel, however, said that UNMIN had  failed to fulfill its role as per the mandate despite having added  its tenure many times in the past. 
    ""There is no reason to keep them,"" he said. 
    He also said that the peace process in the country can be  completed without UNMIN's presence. 
    Meanwhile, Representative of the UN Secretary-General Karin  Landgren has said that Nepal's peace process is in peril. 
    Landgren also said that it is the petty interest of the  political leaders, which is forcing the UNMIN to leave stating  that more difficult situation can follow Nepal in the near future. 
    Meanwhile, President of United Nepal Nationalist Front (UNNF)  Phanindra Nepal also presented a letter of appeal addressed to UN  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, urging for UNMIN's stay in Nepal.

    The document, known as the 17-point agreement, was signed  between the Chinese central government and representatives sent by  the 14th Dalai Lama to decide the plateau region's future. 
    According to the document, the Tibetan people should ""unite and  drive out imperialist aggressive forces from Tibet and return to  the big family of the People's Republic of China."" 
    The document further said the Tibetan local government should  assist the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to enter Tibet and  consolidate the national defense. It also pledged to keep the  status of the Dalai Lama and ensure religious freedom in Tibet. 
    In matters relating to various reforms in Tibet, it said  Tibet's local government should carry out reforms of its own  accord, and, when the people raised demands for reform they should  be settled by means of consultation with the leading personnel of  Tibet. 
    The agreement was followed, five months later, by the arrival  of PLA troops in Lhasa on Oct. 26. 
    Trinley Dondrup, 80, said he was ""secretly delighted"" at the  PLA's coming. A serf sold to a local aristocratic family near the  Potala, he was constantly whipped for minor offences and in dire  need of a full meal and his freedom. 
    The number of serfs and slaves accounted for 95 percent of the  Tibetan population in 1951. The lords, including the Dalai Lama's  relatives, owned all the land, forests, rivers and slaves. The  lords could torture and even kill the serfs and slaves freely,  though all were devout Buddhists. 
    When the PLA troops arrived in Lhasa, Trinley Dondrup said he  saw ""men and women in uniforms way different from the Tibetan  robes...It was the first time I ever saw anyone without a cloak  on. At first sight I thought they were naked."" 
    Tseten Dorje's first impression of the soldiers, however, was  frightening. 
    ""Rumors had it that the PLA were cannibals -- some of them wore  face masks that kept them from eating humans alive,"" said Tseten  Dorje, 76. Those frightening cannibals, he said, turned out to be  friendly and even offered candies and biscuits to the children. 
    Unlike other troops, -- such as the British, these soldiers  never plundered local Tibetan's food. Instead, they planted wheat  themselves, according to Tseten Dorje. 
    Today, the face masks that young Tseten Dorje took as ""bridles""  are popular among the Tibetans as effective protection from  ultraviolet radiation. 
    In 1951, Tseten Dorje was an actor at a Tibetan drama troupe.  He is the same age as the 14th Dalai Lama. 
    The Dalai Lama, 16 years old at the time, did not witness the  PLA's arrival. He was staying in Dromo, today's Yadong County on  the China-India border, perplexed over whether he should go into  exile to India or the United States. 
    But it was the Dalai Lama himself who decided to send  negotiators to Beijing after he obtained more information about  what was going on. 
    Several months later, he was further assured after the central  government sent a representative to Yadong to explain to him the  signing process of the 17-point agreement. Then the Dalai Lama  decided to return to Lhasa. 
    On Oct. 24, the Dalai Lama said in a telegram to Mao Zedong  that he supported the leadership of the central government led by  the Chinese Communist Party. ""Tibet's local government, monks and  people supported stationing of the PLA in Tibet."" 
    This, he said, was to consolidate national defense, drive out  imperialist powers and protect the sovereignty of China's  territory. 
    But after his exile to India in 1959, the Dalai Lama insisted  the agreement had been signed under duress. In his autobiography,  ""My Land and My People,"" he said it was a ""terrible shock"" when he  heard the 17-point agreement over the radio. 
    Kyizom Gyaltsen Phuntsog, however, said otherwise. 
    ""When our five-member delegation arrived in Beijing, Zhou Enlai  personally welcomed us at the railway station,"" he said. ""We had  pleasant and candid talks and exchanged ideas freely. No one  forced us to say or do anything."" 
    Kyizom Gyaltsen Phuntsog was an aide to Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme,  Tibet's chief negotiator to Beijing in 1951.

    ""These horrific acts are not only a violation of international  and humanitarian law, they are a violation of our common humanity,  "" Anthony Lake, executive director for UNICEF, told the UN  Security Council in an open debate on children and armed conflict. 
    Lake's statement came after the UN Security Council unanimously  adopted a resolution, which expanded the criteria for listing  parties to conflict in the secretary-general's annual report. The  criteria will now include parties who attack schools and  hospitals. 
    ""And today, the Council has affirmed that attacks on schools  and hospitals are attacks on children -- and must be treated as  such, for these grave violations are alarmingly common,"" he said. 
    By the Council's actions, Lake said he hopes that ""this will  spur governments and other groups to do more to prevent attacks on  schools and hospitals -- defining concrete plans to end those  violations."" 
    ""And when they will not, creating clearer links to sanctions  committees will strengthen this Council's ability to take action,  for impunity is as intolerable in a civilized society as justice  is indispensable,"" Lake said. 
    He added that the resolution may lead to ""necessary discussion""  on the military use of schools and hospitals, encouraging more  governments to follow the lead of Nepal and the Philippines in  protecting schools as zones of peace. 
    With human costs of these attacks ""beyond statistical  calculation,"" Lake said costs to society are also staggering with  more than 40 percent of all children out of school living in  conflict areas and in the world's poorest places. 
    ""We must not fail these children,"" Lake said. ""It is up to all  of us to take action to protect the schools where they learn and  the hospitals where they heal -- for to do so is to protect their  individual futures, and the future of their societies."" 
    Prior to the resolution, the secretary-general's annual list  included parties who recruit or use children, kill or maim  children, or commit sexual violence.

 Kathmandu, 8 May: Agitating political parties began their previously announced protest programmes against the 4 October royal takeover today, staging a 20-minute long silent demonstration at various major points in the capital and across the nation.
 The silent protests, officially in observance of Martyr's Day in memory of the people felled in the 1990 People's Movement, marks the beginning of the parties ""Peoples' Movement"" protest programmes announced early this week through a mass rally at Tundikhel.
 The protests are aimed at pressing King Gyanendra to hand over power to the parties. The agitating parties claim that executive power was ""usurped"" by the monarch on 4 October last year when he sacked an elected government…
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 9 May 03
Reports from outside the valley said that political parties staged similar silent protests in several districts. Our correspondents reported that similar protests were staged in, among others, Biratnagar, Birganj, Pokhara, Bhairahawa, Butwal and other major towns and districts. The protests were largely peaceful, the reports said.
 In Kathmandu, however, minor violence occurred when the agitating protesters vandalized the vehicle of the Supreme Court Justice Krishna Kumar Verma at Kamal Pokhari. Verma was not in the car at the time of the attack. Police said no one was injured.
 During today's protest in Kathmandu, Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala later addressed the crowd at Shahid Gate and once again argued why the protests were necessary. Similarly CPN (UML) Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal led his party's rally at Ratna Park…
 Similarly, Peoples' Front Nepal organized its programme at Bhotahity and Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party observed 20-minute silence at Putali Sadak in the capital and Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandi Devi) joined the NC at Shahid Gate.
 The valley's normally chaotic transportation became even more chaotic in the wake of the protests today.
 Meanwhile, the Nepali Congress (Democratic), which is not in the five-party alliance, has announced that it will hold its own protest programme throughout the country tomorrow. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the president of the party, was the prime minister when he was sacked by King Gyanendra on 4 October.
 The NC (Democratic) said today that its protests too are aimed at pressing the king to hand over power to the parties. The Deuba-led party has remained outside the five party alliance primarily due to bad blood with the Koirala-led Congress, from which it split a year ago. However, there have been efforts to enlist the Deuba party within the alliance in recent days.

 Kathmandu, 19 December: Diplomats based in Kathmandu have said that Nepal's Maoist violence and political instability are the main obstacles for development.
 One day after the US Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs Christina Rocca returned home after completing Nepal's four-day visit, envoys of the US, the UK, India, the European Union, and the director of the World Bank made public somewhat similar views at the same programme.
 At a time when controversy is being raised over the foreigners' concern and activities in Nepal's internal affairs, this unanimous voice of the diplomats is meaningful. Saying that assistance was affected due to lack of peace in Nepal , they were of the opinion that foreign assistance and investment would increase sizably if there is peace, order and political stability. They also pointed out the weakness of the Nepal government in strengthening private sector and transparency.

""Because the Maoist problem is the main obstacle for a prosperous Nepal, it is inevitable that the political forces unite and isolate them,"" said the chiefs of donor countries and communities stationed in Nepal.
 The heads of diplomatic community expressed the opinion at an interaction programme entitled ""Current Economic Challenges and the Need for a Cohesive Economic Community"" organized by the Confederation of Nepalese Industries in the capital on Friday 19 December . US Ambassador to Nepal Michael E. Malinowski had called the Nepali entrepreneurs and businessmen to become united and alienate the Maoists to create an adequate environment for investment.
 Ambassador Malinowski said that Nepal's future would be determined by honest efforts of the private sector, which is the main vehicle of economic development, thrashing out of appropriate policies, and political stability. ""The concerned parties' attention is very necessary towards thrashing out appropriate policies and political stability,"" he said.
 ""By isolating the Maoists, an effort for talks in collaboration among the king and the political parties for a peaceful dialogue is necessary,"" Malinowski said. Ambassador Malinowski was of the opinion that the US and other communities are also seen interested to make investments in Nepal, and Nepal itself should create such environment. For Nepal, which has entered the WTO, it seems worthwhile that it encourages the private sector investment in the future.
 British Ambassador Keith George Bloomfield also gave his opinion supporting Malinowski's views. Bloomfield had said that it was necessary for all sides to work to bring the Maoists to peace talks. He had stressed the need for the entrepreneurs to stand united against the Maoists, refuse to give donations and boycott them.
 Indian Ambassador Shyam Saran repeating British ambassador's views said, ""It is important for the government to make full efforts for peace talks keeping in view the conflict."" Ambassador Saran made it clear that there was no doubt over the fact that the king and political parties should work together for that to bring Maoists to talks .
 World Bank's Nepal Director Kenichi Ohashi, mentioning that the complex political situation and Maoist problem have affected the aid coming to Nepal said, ""If the country is taken along the path of peace by boosting self confidence and efficiency of the Nepalese, foreign investment and aid will flood in.""
 The Nepal office chief of the European Union Rudiger Wenk and other ambassadors and representatives of diplomatic missions had expressed solidarity on other speakers' views.  passage omitted
