"1",20021080,"India seeks to pressure Pakistan at South Asia summit.rtf","India was looking to sustain diplomatic pressure on Pakistan as the crisis triggered by a military build-up on their common border moved Wednesday into the multilateral arena at a South Asia regional conference in Nepal.
India's Jaswant Singh flew to Kathmandu for a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from the seven members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), ahead of a full leadership summit beginning Friday.
Shortly after his arrival in the Nepalese capital, Singh offered prayers at a temple dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.
The summit will attract keen international attention given spiralling military tensions on the Indo-Pakistan border, which have seen the two nuclear rivals teeter on the brink of a full-scale war.
The border stand-off followed last month's attack on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi has blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups acting at the behest of Pakistani military intelligence.
While denying any involvement, Islamabad has cracked down on the militant groups identified by New Delhi, and there are hopes that the SAARC meeting will provide an opportunity for both countries to further ease tensions.
India, however, has so far refused to commit to bilateral talks at any level in Kathmandu, insisting that Pakistan must first take further ""counter-terrorist"" measures.
The international community has called on both countries to exercise restraint and analysts say India's opposition to dialogue is aimed at forcing more concessions from Pakistan via pressure from Washington.
India has ensured that terrorism will top the agenda in Kathmandu and will lay out its case against Pakistan as a sponsor of ""cross-border terrorist activity.""
While India has ruled out a one-to-one meeting between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on the summit sidelines, it has left the door open to possible talks at the foreign minister level or below.
""Talks between political leaders below the summit level would be a wise strategy, provided that they do not raise unnecessary expectations or unwarranted rhetoric,"" The Indian Express said in an editorial.
""The politico-diplomatic offensive by India against terrorism requires that now Pakistan has started to take steps against terrorist organisations … we give them time to move further.""
One possible sticking point is a list of 20 wanted ""terrorists and criminals"" India handed to Pakistan this week, demanding they be arrested and extradited.
""This list is very important,"" Home Minister L.K. Advani told AFP on Tuesday, adding that Islamabad needed to ""continue to take vigorous anti-terrorist actions.""
But Pakistan insists that without evidence, it cannot take action against the alleged militants.
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar was quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying Islamabad would consider the extraditions under the SAARC Anti-Terrorism Convention if India takes steps to formally indict the suspects on the list.
The two countries have no bilateral extradition treaty and Sattar described the issue as being legal rather political in nature.
Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes said the crisis was, for the moment at least, being dealt with on the diplomatic rather than the military front.
""Essentially, diplomacy is still working,"" Fernandes said.
But while the neighbours have appeared to be backing away from military conflict, shells have continued to pound both sides of the frontier dividing the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir.
Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged mortar and heavy machine-gun fire in two areas of southern Kashmir overnight Tuesday, but there were no reports of any casualties.
Sattar had complained in Kathmandu on Tuesday that there had been no Indian response to Islamabad's repeated offer of talks at any level.
""There is no indication of any kind of meeting,"" Sattar said.

He also held talks separately with navy chief Madhavendra Singh and the chief of the airforce, S. Krishnaswamy, the defence ministry official said.
""Thapa discussed defence cooperation between the two countries,"" he told AFP.
Earlier in the day, the Nepalese army chief was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the defence ministry.
Thapa is in Delhi on the invitation of Padmanabhan, who visited Nepal in May. He was also to meet Defence Minister George Fernandes.
On his arrival here Wednesday at the start of his week-long goodwill visit, Thapa held talks with Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who conferred on him the rank of honorary general.
Also on the agenda are visits to the infantry school at Mhow in central India, the largest and the oldest military training institution in the country, and the famous Balaji temple in southern India.
Though it's being touted as a goodwill visit, defence sources in Kathmandu said Thar was in fact on a buying spree for arms for use against Maoist rebels in Nepal.
He was in particular seeking helicopters fitted with night vision and long range automatic guns.
The Maoist rebels have been using improved and advanced long range guns to attack army and police units, inflicting heavy casualties.
India has been one of the major arms suppliers to Nepal in the past. Some of the weaponry supplied includes two helicopters, self-loading rifles (SLRs), AK-47 assault rifles, armoured cars and long-range guns, defence sources say.
Neither of the two countries has officially revealed details of the deals.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed over 7,300 lives.
