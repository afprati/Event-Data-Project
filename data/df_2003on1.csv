"7452",20113180,"Title: What's new from the music scene_.rtf; Date: June 29, 2011 Wednesday; Text: KATHMANDU, June 29 -- So much has happened in the span of two weeks: SLC results out (Congrats to the graduates!); celebration of World Music Day; the second death anniversary of Michael Jackson, the King of Pop; and a surprising hike on fuel price.
And amidst all these happenings, if a bundle of the hottest new releases from the international music scene is what catches your attention the most, then I have enough of merchandise to lighten up your mood.
Steven Tyler rocked out as one of the new judges on the 10th season of American Idol. Well, that job of his is over, yet he still has no time to spare as he begins his preparation for his first ever solo project! Yes, in the history of 38 Aerosmith years! And while the rocker engages to make his upcoming album, here's a single that's already a part of it. It's the track ""(It) Feels So Good.
"" Featuring background vocals from former Pussycat Dolls beauty Nicole Scherzinger, the song is a Funky Rock anthem for the season. Other than that, you don't need any more reasons to check it out. Just do it!
You've loved Lady Antebellum for their obvious hits.
Now you'll love them for one more song! It's called ""Just A Kiss"" and is a piece from their upcoming third album. Speaking of the single, the country favs say, they love writing about personal experiences, and this is definitely one of them.
Here, they're singing about the excitement at the beginning of a new relationship. And it's not just the words; its melody is also equally beautiful. ""Just A Kiss"" makes one feel that Lady Antebellum aren't so overrated, after all.
You can hardly find anyone who doesn't like The Corrs. It could be because of their decent Irish persona, or their ever so soothing music.
Whatever the reason may be, my next piece of information will certainly enthrall you.
The sibling quartet's lead vocalist Andrea Corr has appeared with her own solo effort! ""Lifelines"" is her newly released album, and the first single off the set happens to be ""Tinseltown In The Rain."" Believe me, the song is as beautiful as its title, i.e., if you think it to be so.
And although her sound seems similar to the band's music, she has retained their individuality, and that's what I like about it the most.
""Sweet"" is how I would explain Owl City's music, whether it lies under the genre of Pop Rock, Dance Pop or simple Pop music! And it goes without saying, that his latest effort ""Deer In The Headlights"" is no exception! In fact, I believe Owl City has come up with a potpourri of such genres in the single.
It's taken from his fresh album ""All Things Bright And Beautiful,"" and things get only better when you hear his sweetly sung tune.
Whether Lady Gaga achieves a record of 10 million followers on Twitter or gets sued, the insanely stylish singer's music continues to blaze the airwaves. ""The Edge of Glory"" is one of her new singles that speaks of the very last moments of living on Earth.
Taken from Gaga's current set ""Born This Way,"" the melody of the dance song resembles much of the musical works of Bruce Springsteen, and is similar to the sounds of Electro Rock and Synthpop music.
However, the interesting part of the track has to be the notable saxophone solo passage, performed by late legendary Clarence Clemons, the prominent member of Springsteen's own The E Street Band.
""Replay"" was the single that introduced us to Iyaz, thanks to its catchy hooks and chorus.
This time around, the singer-songwriter has teamed up with Travie McCoy for his latest track, ""Pretty Girls."" It's to be featured in his as yet untitled second album, and sees him dealing with a difficult situation: Too many lovely ladies to choose from. Poor Iyaz is trying to pick the right one.
If you share the same kind of confusion, then you won't find a better song to express yourself!
I believe there's a competition for Beyonce and her new single ""Run The World (Girls)."" Jordin Sparks returns to the scene with one hot track that has women empowerment written all over it.
""I Am Woman"" is the 2007 American Idol's latest song which is about different aspects of the lives of women. And it's not just the lyrics that are strong; the beats also emerge highly infectious and irresistible to dance to.
The song is from her forthcoming third studio album.
Watcha Say hitmaker Jason Derulo is back with an enjoyable new-age party smasher.
Remember the lead single ""Don't Wanna Go Home"" from his soon-to-be released album ""Future History"" in case you have a gathering coming up.
And also tag it along with Black Eyed Peas' fresh offering, ""Don't Stop The Party."" Both of these club bangers make a perfect combo together!

"7162",20081822,"Title: Government formation in Nepal matter of immediate concern - US official.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: July 13, 2008 Sunday
Text of report published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 21February
Kathmandu, 12 July: The United States of America has said that the issue of government formation in Nepal is a matter of immediate concern for it. 
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Erik Feigenbaum made this remark while addressing a meeting at the Peace Institute in Washington DC on Saturday [12 July]. ""Nepal is battling with many challenges at the moment. But our immediate concern is regarding the formation of the new government,"" US official Feigenbaum said. He said that in a situation where Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has resigned from his post, formation of new government is an important issue. 
The election of the constituent assembly held on 10 April is very important in the political process of Nepal. We extended our congratulations to the Nepalese people on that occasion. But the important question is what is happening now, Feigenbaum said. He expressed his confidence that the problem will be resolved once the dispute over power sharing among the political parties ends. 
Besides writing the new constitution, the constituent assembly should also address issues such as supply of petroleum products, shortage of essential commodities, rising poverty and development. He said that the US had special concerns over the process of democratization and peace in Nepal. 
The American official expressed his worries over the continuing politically motivated violence. This king of violence is a political attack in small scale. Maoist leaders are still in terrorist list in two states of America, he said. For this reason, Maoist leaders were banned from entering the States, he said. 
Stable, democratic and prosperous Nepal is our primary concern, Feigenbaum said. He had visited Nepal in May. During his visit, he held talks with different political leaders including the Maoists. Then, he had expressed his concerns over the peace process, violence and the role of the international community.

"7269",2009903,"Title: Bagram_ the US nerve centre in Afghanistan.rtf; Date: December 2, 2009 Wednesday 3:07 AM GMT; Text: Each and every meal prepared for US soldiers at the sprawling Bagram military base in Afghanistan costs about 28 dollars a head -- more than most Afghans earn in a month.
The enormous financial outlay of the eight-year war is brought into sharp focus at Bagram Airfield, where warplanes roar into the skies to the battlefields but where off-duty soldiers can buy burgers, massages and motorbikes.
And it is at Bagram that many of US President Barack Obama's 30,000 extra troops will get a first taste of Afghanistan.
With its maze of Soviet-era architecture and plywood huts, Bagram is the biggest US garrison in Afghanistan and boasts a dazzling array of fast-food joints and a Harley Davidson dealership for those away from the frontlines.
Already home to more than 25,000 people, the man responsible for its day-to-day running, Lieutenant Colonel Troy Joslin, says the base was on track to grow another 15-20 percent in the next year even without the extra troops.
Colleagues describe Joslin as ""mayor of Bagram"", in charge of a base he says has grown 30 percent over the past year in a bustle of expansion that has seen disused land de-mined to make way for new buildings.
""I don't see us going away in the immediate future,"" Joslin told AFP in the two-storey Soviet-built block that serves as nerve centre of the 2,100-hectare (5,190-acre) compound outside the Afghan capital Kabul.
The passenger terminal is being upgraded to accommodate 1,000 personnel a day, up from its current seating capacity of 250, says the US Air Force.
""This is especially important during surges in passenger movements during an increase in force levels and unit deployments,"" said Captain David Faggard, a US Air Force spokesman at Bagram.
On a busy day, the terminal strains to cope with around 1,650 inbound and outbound passengers, he said.
Many of the new troops are likely to take-off or land on Bagram's three-kilometre (two-mile) runway en route to battle the Taliban militia.
Sending in the extra troops will cost the US military 30 billion dollars this year, Obama said -- or one million dollars for each deployed soldier.
There are at least 5,000 civilians on base working for companies contracted by the military, such as Kellog, Brown & Root (KBR) and Presidential Aviation, whose pilots still lounge around with ""Blackwater Aviation"" marked on their jackets -- a name laden with controversy since its operations in Iraq.
Multi-course meals are cooked up by KBR costing what a US military spokesman said is 28 dollars per head per meal, more than most Afghans earn a month.
Some nights the fare includes steaks and crab legs, with most of the food flown in more than 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) from the United States.
KBR employees also collect the trash, clean the toilets, provide a laundry service and supply fuel to aircraft -- doing just about anything that needs to be done without the use of a weapon or military equipment.
Under the supervision of KBR managers, Afghans do most of the menial work. There are also Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Indians, Kyrgyz, Nepalese, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Tajiks and Uzbeks, working as labourers and service staff.
Bagram's main thoroughfare is Disney Drive, named after a US serviceman who died in a welding accident in 2002.
With all the construction work and military operations, the road is prone to traffic jams, clogged with mine-proof vehicles and cement trucks.
""Traffic is the biggest headache,"" says Joslin. ""There are approximately 2,000 vehicles on the base, double that if you count construction vehicles and Gators (a vehicle resembling a golf cart).""
Alcohol may be banned, in keeping with US military policy, but there is no shortage of recreation.
Special guests are flown in -- the actor Gary Sinise and his band played a concert recently -- while Kyrgyz women offer soldiers eight-dollar haircuts and full-body massages at 20 dollars an hour at a popular beauty salon.
The PX facility -- a sort of shopping mall built out of shipping containers and plywood -- has a supermarket, Burger King, Pizza Hut and Green Beans coffeeshop open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Other shops sell sports clothing, jewellery, ""Afghan apparel"" and souvenirs and cell phones. The Harley Davidson dealership says it sells around four motorcycles a month to US servicemen.
To counter the shortage of space, Joslin says, most of the mines have been cleared to make way for barracks, particularly on the eastern side of the base, where a new detention facility and cement factory are located.
The old prison will be reassigned and the former Soviet-built control tower has been converted into offices for the US Air Force.
The US military has built a chapel on site and is also restoring three Bagram mosques, including one named after Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance leader assassinated two days before September 11 attacks.

"1004",20031576,"Title: Roundup_ Nepal 's garment manufacturers face closure By Wu Haimang, Song Dejun.rtf; Date: October 7, 2003, Tuesday; Text: By Wu Haimang, Song Dejun
KATHMANDU, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- The condition of Nepal's ready- made garment industry is becoming pitiable due to the decreasing garment exports and confusing policies for the industry.
Local manufacturers complained that most of their ready-made garment factories are facing a shortage of working capital and are unable to pay back bank loans.
""With business and exports declining in the country, most of the ready-made garment units have turned sick and 75 percent of the workers have been laid off,"" said Shata Pokharel, central vice- president of the Garment Association of Nepal.
Lack of proper prerequisites and labor policy are the main hindering factors that are threatening the closure of the ready- made garment units, Pokharel explained.
""As wage in Nepal is more than what it is in other South Asian countries and the government has not formulated any specific labor policy for the ready-made garment sector, some of these manufacturers would have to be closed down,"" he said.
The closure of the ready-made garment units, which have been playing a crucial role in resolving the unemployment problem in the Himalayan Kingdom and helping Nepal to beef up its foreign currency reserves, will further dampen the country's economy, he added.
The garments industry in Nepal is entirely export oriented and accounts for 40 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings. It employs over 100,000 workers and sustains the livelihood of over 350,000 people.
Most of the country's ready-made garment factories were established in the last 12 years, which had been manufacturing apparels and textile products as per the demands of foreign markets. More than 100 ready-made garment manufacturers have been established since 1990, which provided direct employment to about 100,000 people in the country.
Apart from the direct employment, about 500,000 Nepalese people benefited indirectly from the industry in which a total investment of more than 7 billion rupees (946 million dollars) have been made.
In fiscal year 2002/2003, which ended to July 15 this year, the Himalayan kingdom exported ready-made garments worth 115.92 million Nepali rupees (1.56 million US dollars) directly to some western countries including the United States, Canada and most of the European countries as well as Australia.
However, as most of the manufacturers have become sick, there is no chance of generating the same volume of exports during the current fiscal year, which began from July 16 this year.
Due to the slump in garment export, about 30,000 Nepali garment workers have lost their jobs while several garment factories were forced to be closed down, according to the Garment Association of Nepal.
The United States is the largest market of Nepal's garment items overseas, consuming some 85 percent of its total garment export. Another 10 percent are exported to Canada and the remaining are exported to European countries and Australia.
The Nepalese manufacturers complained that their exported garments to the American market have been sharply declined since the US government imposed 15 to 30 percent customs duty on Nepal's ready-made garments, while the garment products of five African nations enjoy duty and quota free access to the same market, weakening the competitiveness of the Nepali garments.
They hope the US Senate will pass a bill on granting Nepali garments duty and quota-free status for two years from Oct. 1 this year to Sept. 30, 2005. The bill, already tabled in the Senate, was withdrawn in June this year due to some specific reason.

"623",20031391,"Title: 15 more die in Nepal ahead of Maoist holiday truce.rtf; Date: September 27, 2003 Saturday; Text: Another 15 people were killed Saturday in surging violence across Nepal a day after the rebels announced a nine-day ceasefire from October 2 during the Hindu kingdom's biggest festival, officials said.
Twelve Maoists were killed in a gunbattle with security forces at Chhita Pokhara in the Khotang district, 340 kilometers (212 miles) east of Kathmandu, a police officer said.
Elsewhere in eastern Nepal, Maoists opened fire outside a bus where police were checking passengers' identities, killing two policemen and a female street vendor, said Sita Ram Pokharel, the chief administrator for the Jaljale-Gaighat area.
The rebels also bombed five public utilities in the southeastern industrial hub Janakpur, disrupting telephone service and power and prompting an elderly man's death from a heart attack, police inspector Bharat Khadka said.
Maoist supremo Prachanda had Friday said the Maoists would ""adjourn all our aggressive activities"" from October 2 to 10 as residents flock to their home villages to celebrate the post-monsoon festival Dasain.
But the Maoists, who ended a ceasefire on August 27 after seven months, warned it would end the temporary truce if the army used the occasion to attack the rebels.
Information Minister Kamal Thapa, the government spokesman, would not say if security forces would also observe a holiday ceasefire.
""The government has never declared a war. Whatever the government has done is to contain the violence,"" Thapa told reporters.
""We welcome the ceasefire,"" he added.
Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said the Maoists should try to relaunch negotiations during Dasain, which celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the forces of evil.
""What the government wants is a permanent ceasefire again,"" said Lohani, who with Thapa led the team that unsuccessfully negotiated with the Maoists this year.
""In the last round of talks we told the Maoists that even if they had differences they should honor the ceasefire, but they abruptly ended it. Now is a time to work again for a permanent solution,"" Lohani said.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist state. Since the end of the truce at least 280 people have died in renewed fighting, according to government figures.
The tolls from most incidents are impossible to verify independently as they take place in isolated rural areas.
Madhav Kumar Nepal, the consensus prime ministerial candidate of the mainstream parties -- which do not recognize the royal-appointed government -- said both the Maoists and the government needed to show more commitment to peace.
""Both the government and the Maoists need to observe a permanent, long-term ceasefire,"" Nepal told AFP.
""We welcome the Maoists' ceasefire, but it is only temporary. They haven't succeeded in creating an atmosphere of trust,"" Nepal said.
""They should have stated very clearly that they're not going to attack innocent people or the general public,"" he added.
Prachanda in his statement said the Maoists were ready for a permanent ceasefire if the government agreed to set up a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The rebel demand was the key dispute that scuttled the last negotiations on August 19 after three days.

Excerpt from report headlined ""Nepal government urged to amend laws on disappearance"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 30 December
Kathmandu, [Monday] 29 December: The National Human Rights Commission has urged the government to amend some provisions of the Disappearance Bill 2065 BS. 
In its suggestions sent to the government on Monday, the human rights watchdog has said the bill should take into account the Supreme Court ruling on forced disappearance and the international norms and practices. 
The rights commission has drawn the government's attention at a time when it is set to table the bill in the council of minister and then in the Constituent Assembly for approval. The bill was drafted by the Peace and Reconstruction Ministry. The incidents of disappearance keep occurring during conflict and even during transition, and should therefore be covered, the human rights commission said. The bill should ensure that no citizen goes missing on the pretext of war, armed struggle, national security or the state of emergency. The new law should recognize such incidents as a grave crime against humanity. When investigating these cases, the commission has demanded that the progress and process should be made public. It also suggested that while taking a person into custody, a record of date, place, officer involved, agency, reason, health condition of the person arrested and other details should be kept. It also suggested preventive steps to control forced disappearances such as dissemination of public information, spreading legal awareness and operation of hotline telephone for the security of citizens. The kin of those missing should be ensured the right to seek legal remedy and acquire relevant information regarding the arrest and disappearance. The commission also said the state should not ignore its responsibility towards the family members to search for the missing person, secure their release, seek information on their whereabouts, exhume the body, identity and perform their last rites.

"934",20032096,"Title: Nepal king calls for end to Maoist violence in holiday message.rtf; Date: October 5, 2003 Sunday; Text: King Gyanendra called Sunday for an end to Nepal's seven-year Maoist insurgency and said all sides wanted peace, in a message marking the kingdom's biggest Hindu festival Dasain.
In the message read by announcers on state television and radio, the king said: ""Our nation, traditionally bound by fellowship, warmth and cooperation, has since the past few years been in the grip of violence, terrorism and the destruction of development infrastructure.
""Every Nepali desires to see an end to this situation and resumption of development activities and an environment of peace, security and good governance,"" Gyanendra said.
""As long as there is an atmosphere of recrimation and mistrust, the problems facing the country cannot be resolved,"" he said.
Gyanendra, in keeping with custom, stood for hours Sunday at his Kathmandu palace to offer holiday greetings to tens of thousands of ordinary people, many of the elderly.
The king applied a smudge of red vermilion on the forehead of each well-wisher, a blessing he also offered to Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa and senior military leaders.
The Dasain festival, known in India as the Durga Puja, marks the Hindu goddess Durga's slaying of a demon, symbolising the triumph of good over evil.
The Maoists, who want to abolish the monarchy and make the Hindu kingdom a secular republic, called an October 2-10 truce for the festival, when thousands of city residents flock to their home villages for family gatherings.
Nonetheless, state radio reported the deaths of seven Maoists in clashes with troops Friday, the second day of the temporary truce.
The rebels ended a ceasefire on August 27 after seven months when the government refused to meet their demand for a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The insurgency has claimed more than 8,100 lives since 1996, according to official figures.
Nepal's major political parties, seething after Gyanendra dismissed the elected government a year ago, held their own Dasain functions Sunday in Kathmandu.
""May Navadurga (Goddess Durga) provide inspiration to all those who have faith in multi-party democracy and untie the task of ushering in a new era of peace and development,"" the king said in his message.

[Presenter] An influential Maoist military leader says that the Maoist army would confine itself within a predetermined line of demarcation during the elections for the constituent assembly. The deputy commander of the Western Command of the People's Liberation Army, Prabhaker, said that his men would remain thus under the supervision of an international agency. Talking to Kantipur TV, he said that the PLA would not lay down their arms and come out, they would rather confine themselves to a designated area while keeping their weapons with them.

"2948",20045094,"Title: Southern Indian state offers three-month ceasefire to Maoist rebels.rtf; Date: June 16, 2004 Wednesday; Text: The southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh offered a three-month ceasefire to Maoist guerrillas Wednesday, paving the way for the start of peace talks with the outlawed rebels, officials said.
State Home Minister K. Jana Reddy offered the ceasefire a day after the People's War Group (PWG) demanded a truce as a prelude to talks to end their decades-long insurgency which has claimed thousands of lives.
""By stopping the combing (search) operations, the government is already implementing a virtual ceasefire. However, in response to the PWG's proposals, the government suggests a three-month (ceasefire) period,"" Reddy told a news conference in the state capital Hyderabad.
Reddy however said said his newly-formed state government was not lifting a ban imposed on the PWG by the previous state administration of ousted chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.
""This matter will be considered at a later stage,"" he said, adding that his government was also accepting the PWG's demand for safe passage for its representatives taking part in peace talks.
The group is also pressing for the formation of a panel to monitor the ceasefire's implementation.
""My government is also ready to set up such a committee to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire, as suggested by the Maoist organisation,"" the minister said.
Wednesday's unilateral ceasefire is the first since 1989 when the then administration halted a crackdown against the leftwing insurgents.
The truce, however, collapsed within a year with Andhra Pradesh accusing the PWG of using the lull in police action to regroup in the region's impoverished countryside.
In June 2002, then chief minister Naidu opened talks but they collapsed after a few rounds when his government refused to accept demands for a ceasefire.
Some 10,000 people have died in Andhra Pradesh in the past 30 years as the guerrillas, who claim to represent the poor, have waged their insurgency against wealthy landowners and the government.
The state government of Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy vowed after taking office last month to try to end the bloodletting through talks with the guerrillas, who are suspected to have links with Maoist rebels in Nepal.
Andhra Pradesh is now governed by India's ruling Congress party.

China has lodged an official protest with the United States over Wednesday's protest, in which the Americans called for Tibetan independence and voiced outrage at the 2008 Olympic torch passing through the Himalayan region.
""There are people all over the world who are Tibet supporters and this is just the first of a cascading waterfall of actions,"" said Shannon Service, one of the five detained and questioned for two days before being kicked out Friday.
At Wednesday's protest, the Americans unfurled banners demanding a ""free Tibet"" and sang the anthem of the Tibetan government-in-exile before the Chinese detained them, said protestor Tenzin Dorjee, an American of Tibetan origin.
The protest came a day before the Beijing Olympic Games organisers formally announced plans to bring the Olympic torch to the top of the world's highest peak as part of a relay that also takes in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.
The five were questioned for hours and made to sign a document apologising for their actions, before being expelled into neighbouring Nepal Friday, said the activists from the US-based Students for a Free Tibet.
""We were told we had endangered the security of China,"" said Kirsten Westby, another protester.
After questioning the five were paraded in front of Chinese state-run media, then taken in a large vehicle convoy to Nepal's border with Chinese-controlled Tibet.
""It was a very frightening and confusing experience, and only a glimpse into what the Chinese would do to a local Tibetan,"" said Service.
Beijing has lodged a protest with the United States over the incident and demanded that Washington prevent similar events in the future.
""Tibet is an inseparable part of China and the Chinese government and people will never tolerate any activity aimed at splitting China,"" China's foreign ministry said Friday.
The activist group would continue to stage protests both inside and outside China in the run-up to the 2008 Games, group director Lhadon Tethong said.
""The situation in Tibet is desperate and the world seems ready to move on, but the issue is not done. Non-violent actions like this will continue until Tibet is free,"" Tethong told reporters.
China has ruled Tibet since sending troops in to ""liberate"" the region in 1951 and has violently suppressed a number of uprisings since then.
Around 2,500 Tibetans now make the arduous and dangerous trip each year over the Himalayas to flee into Nepal and often onto India, home to exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
In recent years, the Dalai Lama has backed off a push for Tibetan independence, and now campaigns for the Himalayan region to have ""genuine autonomy.""

Baburam Bhattarai, second-in-command of the rebel group, appeared before reporters with four key colleagues. It was his first public appearance since the rebels began their violent campaign in 1996 to end the constitutional monarchy in this Himalayan kingdom.
""Instead of creating a conducive environment for the peace talks, the ruling side has been involved in acts that could disrupt the talks,"" Bhattarai told a crowded press conference in the capital Katmandu.
""We have taken a big risk to come out in the open because we are sincere and serious about finding a peaceful resolution to the problem,"" said Bhattarai, who arrived in Katmandu on Friday but had avoided the public and media.
Bhattarai said government troops were harassing rebel supporters, preventing them from holding peaceful gatherings and meetings, and was delaying the release of rebel supporters still in custody.
He said the rebels were ready for the talks and would like them to begin immediately.
""The talks will succeed,"" Bhattarai said.
On Friday, government peace negotiator Narayan Singh Pun, who is minister for physical planning, said the two sides would hold an introductory meeting on Tuesday.
It is expected to last one day. The two sides would be formally introduced and decide when to meet again to discuss key issues, officials say.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They are demanding an interim government and an election for a new constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.
The rebels decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.
During previous peace talks in 2001, rebel negotiators and government ministers met three times. The rebels accused the government of being inflexible and withdrew from the talks.
Following the failed talks, the rebels launched attacks on government targets that prompted King Gyanendra to impose a state of emergency in November 2001. Emergency rule was lifted in August.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 17 November
Kathmandu, 16 November: The national workers' gathering of the Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML) has demanded the party leadership to hold a general convention immediately.
The workers demanded a general convention, saying that the party was in a state of policy confusion.
The workers from all over the country were divided into 22 different groups to discuss the political report presented by party General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal. Out of all 22 groups, 20 had demanded a general convention.
At a press conference held at the conclusion of the gathering, CPN-UML Standing Committee member Bam Dev Gautam said, ""The meeting demanded to hold the party's general convention. We have assured them to hold it after discussing the issue at the party Central Committee. We will work to meet our words.""
The next one will not be a special general convention. It will be the eighth general convention, said Gautam. The seventh general convention of the party was held at Janakpurdham [south central Nepal] in 2002. According to the party statute, the conventions are held every five years.
The UML gathering suggested it is not good to collaborate with the Maoists in the current situation. The party workers concluded that alliance with the Maoists is not possible at a time when the rebels are kidnapping political workers and extorting money from them in the villages. The meeting has, however, emphasized that efforts must continue to bring the Maoists into the political mainstream.
The proposal passed by the gathering says that agreement with the rebels should be sought with the involvement of all the seven political parties. If the talks are to be meaningful, the Maoists should accept the multi-party system, peaceful politics and the existence of other parties, they said.
According to a source, the party gathering also demanded to change the party slogan adopted by the Central Committee meeting. The committee had set the slogan of struggle against autocratic monarchy and establishment of a democratic republic through the election of the constituent assembly. The party workers wanted that the struggle should be against the monarchy itself rather than against autocratic monarchy alone.
The party leaders had tired to mollify the workers saying that it is not good for them to challenge the decision of the Central Committee. ""We convinced them to respect the party decision,"" said Gautam.

  Led by former Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, the party said elections cannot be held till the Terai issue is resolved. Normal life in 23 districts of Terai (bordering Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) continued to be crippled for the eighth consecutive day on Wednesday because of the indefinite general strike called by United Democratic Madhesi Front (UDMF). The cadres are protesting against the government's lackadaisical attitude in resolving the demand for an autonomous state in Terai.
  Curfew has been imposed in five districts, and armed police has been deployed in some of the violence-hit areas even as the situation remains tense in the entire Terai region. Shoot-at-sight orders have been issued in Parsa, Bara, Janakpur and Nepalgunj. Meanwhile, agitators blocked Mahendra Highway, the east-west corridor in Nepal.
  ""It's a war-like situation in all the Terai districts,"" Sudhir Karna, an entrepreneur told Hindustan Times over telephone from Birgunj. Several people, including women and children have sustained bullet injuries in the past few days.
 Accusing the government, the Federal Republican National Front (FRNF) has also announced that it would boycott the election.
  The front, which includes several regional and ethnic groups, lambasted Koirala for his failure to meet their demands. The FRNF has also imposed an indefinite strike in the eastern region during the past week. Earlier, the Green Nepal Party had announced to boycott the election demanding a neutral government.

 Kolkata, 23 August: The Nepal government, through its diplomatic missions in India, intends to seek greater coordination with the governments of the bordering Indian states to prevent Maoist rebels from launching attacks from Indian territory. The initiative comes in the wake of the latest threat by the rebels to attack government installations from 8 September in Ilam and Pachathar districts in east Nepal adjoining the India-Nepal border. Incidentally, the Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is scheduled to visit India that day.
The Hindu web site, Chennai, in English 24 Aug 04
Speaking to The Hindu here today, Nepalese diplomatic sources said that Ilam District was adjacent to West Bengal's Darjeeling District ""and the Nepalese government would not like to see a recurrence of attacks like the one by Maoist rebels on the thana police station in the border town of Pashupatinagar from the Indian side of the border in April.
 ""Alert on border""
 The West Bengal government is taking steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Apart from sounding an alert along its open border with Nepal, the state authorities have instructed the Darjeeling district administration to step up measures to prevent Maoist rebels from sneaking into the district. ""We are toning up security in the border areas and are in constant interaction with the officials of the Special Security Bureau manning the India-Nepal border to ensure that there is no infiltration of rebels in the wake of the developments in Nepal,"" the Darjeeling superintendent of police, Rajiv Mishra, said.

""The Maoists have been active in eastern Nepal since August 2001 when rebel leaders met in Siliguri. Ever since, we have been raising with the West Bengal government the presence of Maoist rebels in north Bengal.

 Tokyo, 10 September: The Japanese government announced the appointment of nine ambassadors Friday 10 September , including Yoshiji Nogami, who was sacked as vice foreign minister in 2002 due to a dispute with the foreign minister, as Japan's envoy to Britain.
 The government also promoted Toshiro Suzuki, 50, a minister at the Japanese embassy in Iraq since July, to ambassador, making him the first Japanese ambassador to Baghdad in 13 years since the Persian Gulf War.
 Ministry officials said naming an ambassador to Iraq will help demonstrate Tokyo's resolve to help build a democratic Iraq. Japan's last ambassador to Iraq, Kunio Katakura, made extensive efforts to protect Japanese nationals in Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis. He left Iraq shortly before the US-led coalition forces attacked the country in January 1991. He was relieved of his post in September that year.
Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English 0420 gmt 10 Sep 04
Nogami, 62, who will replace Masaki Orita, was fired as vice foreign minister by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in February 2002 due to a dispute with then Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka. Some lawmakers of both the governing and opposition parties criticized Nogami's ""revival"", saying it was inappropriate for Koizumi to reappoint Nogami to a high-profile post without clear explanations.
 Koizumi defended his decision, telling reporters Friday, ""I appointed an appropriate person to an appropriate post.""
 Kyoji Komachi, 58, secretary-general of the Cabinet Office's International Peace Cooperation Headquarters, was named ambassador to the Netherlands. Ambassador to Kuwait Sumio Tarui, 57, will replace Komachi.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 9 November
Kathmandu, 8 November: The political parties have stressed the need for activating the constitution formed through a people's movement for progression. They said that the constitution which stands on the base that ""people are the source of state power"" has been attacked. On the occasion of the 15th Constitution Day [9 November], they said that the constitution should be activated and the country should be taken towards progression. The Constitution of Nepal 1990 was promulgated on 9 November 1990 following the people's movement. [passage omitted]
President of the Nepali Congress Girija Prasad Koirala has said that the constitution has been wounded by attacking it on its basics. He has termed the attack as an attack on the people's prosperous present and the future. ""For the activation of the constitution, the first precondition now is the end to the situation of parliament-less-ness, or the revival of the parliament,"" Koirala said in a statement issued on the occasion of the Constitution Day. [passage omitted: Koirala said the attack on the constitution was pushing the country towards an unimaginable situation]
Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Bam Dev Gautam in his statement said that Constitution Day was unforgettable as the constitution was formed with the proclamation to make the people sovereign. He said that the royal proclamation of 1 February has created a serious crisis in the activation of the constitution.
""At a time when the seven parties have launched a movement to establish democracy and peace by way of ending the autocratic monarchy and restoring a full-fledged democracy through constituent assembly, I request all those supporters of democracy, peace and human rights to once again work resolutely in support of a new constitution that will be written by the people,"" Gautam said in his statement. [passage omitted: The king's move has destroyed the 1990 constitution, Gautam has said]
In his statement, Acting President of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) Gopal Man Shrestha said that [the king has] had misused all the powers of the executive and legislative to prolong his authoritarian rule. ""In order to bolster the autocratic rule, even the independent judiciary enshrined in the Constitution of Nepal 1990 has been ignored and there have been no let up in the acts of giving unconstitutional and anti-people directives,"" Shrestha said in his statement. Shrestha has urged everyone to participate in the movement of the seven political parties to establish the rule of law.
Chairman of Rastriya Janashakti Party Surya Bahadur Thapa, in his statement, said that His Majesty the king and the political parties, while making democracy the basis, should without delay begin meaningful and inclusive dialogue agreement and collaboration to activate the constitution. ""We all should once again reaffirm out commitment to the Constitution of Nepal 1990, which is a document of agreement of separation, control and balance of power. For progressive reforms and change in the country, we should move ahead, making this very constitution as the starting point,"" Thapa has said.

Speaker Tara Nath Ranabhat, in his statement, has said that there were malpractice like instability, corruption, murder, violence, irresponsible and unaccountable government mechanism and the like, and that everyone should now choose the respectable middle-of-the-road path on the basis of dialogue and agreement.

Nepali forces dug up bodies of Maoist rebels and searched for scores of missing police officers on Monday after what appeared to have been one of the fiercest battles in an eight-year rebellion.
 The rebels' leader also vowed to continue raids on government targets despite a 12-hour gun battle in western Nepal in which, the army said, 500 guerrillas, 28 government troops and 4 civilians died.
 ''The armed attacks will continue until a progressive political solution has been reached,'' the rebel leader, Prachanda, said in a statement.
 The troops said they had found the bodies of 100 guerrillas. The Maoists, fighting to replace the monarchy with a Communist state, routinely carry their dead away from encounters, often burying them near rivers.
 Fifty-eight police and district officials were missing. There was no independent confirmation of the official tally. Both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and understate their own.
 If the official toll is true, it would be the deadliest single battle since the revolt began in 1996. More than 9,000 people, most of them rebels, have died.

Talking to reporters at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) immediately upon their arrival, leader of the delegation and Conservative MP Sir John Stanley said: ""We come here as friends of Nepal... [ellipsis as published] We are here to listen and to learn, and we shall be reporting back to our government and our parliament on our return.""
Sir Stanley further said Nepal is a sovereign country and the resolution of the serious problems Nepal faces must lie with the people of Nepal. 
""However, if we can make some contribution, however, small, to the peaceful re-emergency of stability and multi-party parliamentary democracy in Nepal, our visit will have been worthwhile,"" he added.
In a written statement, Sir Stanley - who has served as a minister in Conservative government - said: ""Our two countries have a unique relationship, stretching back now over nearly 200 years, but still very much alive today. After Japan, Britain is the largest bilateral aid donor to Nepal. Gurkha soldiers remain an integral and highly valued element in the British armed forces. There have been observers from the British parliament at each of the elections held in Nepal since 1991. Nothing symbolizes Britain's support for parliamentary democracy in Nepal more clearly than the fact that the speaker's chair carved in oak in each house of Nepali parliament - the National Assembly and the House of Representatives - were gifts from out parliament at Westminster to Nepalis parliament in Kathmandu.""
Sir Stanley clarified that the present parliamentary visit was initiated by the British government. ""However, though, we have come under the British government's auspices, we speak in our personal capacitates as British parliamentarians and the views express are our own. Having said that, the deep concern of the British government about the suspension of parliamentary democracy, terrorism and violations of human rights in Nepal is a concern shared throughout our parliament and by all political parties in Britain,"" he added.
Responding to a query, Sir Stanley said the delegation had placed a request to call on His Majesty King Gyanendra and waiting for an appointment. He said the delegation would also be visiting Biratnagar to see the international-aided development programme in the eastern town.
Other members of the British parliamentary delegation include Earl of Sandwich, Conservative lawmakers Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and Richard Ottaway, Liberal Democrat MP Baroness Northover and Labour MP Tom Levitt.

 Chitwan, 1 May: Conservation officers of the Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) have revealed that two American nationals killed a ""man-eater"" tigress in the buffer zone of the park while carrying out an unauthorized darting last month. The incident was kept secret till now by park officials, fearing public outcry by the people inhabiting in the buffer zone of the park.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 2 May 04[passage omitted$
 The officials have concluded that they were fake tiger experts since they did not possess even a thermometer during the darting. They were staying in Tiger Tops Jungle Resort nearby.
 The cause of death was kept secret at the beginning. The park officials had told the public inhabiting in the buffer zone of the park that ""the tigress was a man-eater and was killed while trying to dart it"" since the park officials did not know about the darting by the Americans. The tigress died the day after the darting.
 Meanwhile, a cub was shot dead by a local at the maize field of Sinsubar of Divyanagar VDC [village development committee area$ . According to Kunwar, the dead was the one of the three cubs of the killed tigress. The remaining two are roaming here and there suffering from hunger as they cannot prey even a kid.

 Twenty people had lost their lives to the so-called man-eater tigers within last four months in this area. Three tigers that were believed to be man-eaters were killed in Divyanagar, Madi and Kumroj last month.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 3 August
[Presenter] The head of the special United Nations team, Staffan de Mistura, has said that the government leadership has made an official request to the United Nations for its support in managing the weapons of the Nepalese Army and the Maoists, for constituent assembly elections, for monitoring the cease-fire code of conduct and human rights violations.
[Staffan de Mistura, speaking in English] The meetings, extensive interactions and field visits confirm four concrete areas in which the UN with the support of all sides could possibly contribute to the peace process. And these four areas, the four platforms through which the UN could and can contribute to the peace process in Nepal are the arms and armies' management, the electoral assistance, monitoring the code of conduct and broadening of human rights activities in Nepal.
[Presenter] United Nations team chief Staffan de Mistura also told the media before his departure from Kathmandu today that his team would brief the United Nations secretary general and present a report next week, and based on the evaluation of the report, the UN secretary general will make recommendations on the UN's role in Nepal.
[Staffan de Mistura, speaking in English] This clearly will depend on the conclusion of what the secretary general will draw from the assessment mission. This mission is an assessment mission and reports to the Secretary General. The UN's conclusion will draw support and advise from all member countries in the UN. During the mission's stay (In Nepal) there has been a concomitant, positive momentum, and we have felt that. And I think all have contributed to that.
[Presenter] The UN special mission was here in Nepal on a seven-day visit to assess the situation in Nepal and returned back home today. Speaking to the media at the airport before his departure, the Staffan de Mistura said the visit was very useful and positive. And he said the UN would extend all the possible help to Nepal.
[Staffan de Mistura, speaking in English] The assessment mission of the UN was completed with a sense of cautious optimism. Cautious optimism about the possibility of future and continues engagement by the UN in various important aspects related to the peace process in Nepal. 
[Presenter] He said that during his mission his team had extensive discussions with the government, the Maoists, civil society representatives and the military leadership. He said during his meeting, he found a genuine desire for peace and he did not really find much differing views from the various parties he talked to.
[Staffan de Mistura, speaking in English] Of course, you always expect the momentum to go faster than what sometimes happens. But I am quite optimistic that the moment, which the mission witnessed during meetings with, peoples and all the actors will keep going. And you must have noticed it that the discussions have taken place for a longer period of time, in fact regarded as confidence building measures. These are going to produce effects. Now, I would have liked to have that confidence-building measures take place immediately, yesterday. But even if they are announced in the next two or three days while they are being informed by everyone; is fine. What matters is the momentum is not left and everyone is back waiting and hoping that someone else makes a concession. In a peace process you need compromise and flexibility.
[Presenter] He said that he saw the need for confidence building measures between the Nepalese government and the Maoists. He said he was an optimist that peace would prevail once there was mutual trust.
[Staffan de Mistura, speaking in English] The major differences are well known to you so I am not going to repeat that. What I detected is that there is a lack of trust in some cases and there is a lack of knowledge about some of the techniques of confidence building. In both cases the United Nations can help but at the end of the day, they are the ones who are to respond to the people to Nepal in trying to bridge this lack of trust and this lack of going into a process quickly. We are there to help them. Having said that, during the last few days, particularly in the last few hours, I detected them coming much closer to a clear understanding to what is needed in terms of confidence building measures.
[Presenter] The UN's mission head said he would submit his report to the UN secretary general following which decisions would be made by UN member states. He also said that the actual peace process with the involvement of the UN could begin sometime in 2007.

At least 59 people died overnight in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, where the death toll since Dec. 20 now stands at 572, a state government official said.
Another 60 have perished in India's eastern Bihar state.
The Indian capital has experienced the coldest week in five years with the average daily minimum temperature dipping to 38 degrees.
Such temperatures can be fatal in impoverished areas of South Asia, where millions live without heat, electricity or warm clothing in homes that lack insulation. Children and the elderly are the most vulnerable.
Cold winds had pushed down the minimum temperatures in Kanpur, an industrial city in Uttar Pradesh to 37 degrees, the lowest in the state, said meteorological department officials.
""We're calling it Siberian winds … it's a biting icy wind which is bringing down the temperature,"" said R.K. Verma, director of the meteorological office in Lucknow.
The cold weather was expected to continue for at least several more days, Verma said.
Officials distributed fuel wood for public bonfires at street corners. Night shelters were overcrowded as homeless people tried to find a warm place to sleep.
In neighboring Bangladesh, at least 23 more people died due to cold overnight, raising the death toll from the cold spell in Bangladesh to 727.
Thick fog shrouded the capital Dhaka, as the temperature plunged to 42 degrees - unusually low for the tropical country.
Cold weather claimed the lives of eight more people in Nepal on Thursday, Home Ministry officials said on Friday. Forty-seven people have died nationwide during the cold spell, the officials said in Katmandu, Nepal's capital.

Excerpt from report by Nepalnews.com website on 27 December
Bhutanese refugees from seven camps in Jhapa and Morang districts have continued their sit-in programme for the fifth day on Tuesday [27 December].
Over 5,000 refugees staged sit-in in front of the Beldangi II camp administration office in Jhapa District for the fifth day against the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)'s decision of supplying coal briquettes to them as an alternative to kerosene.
Similar protest programme is being organized in Khudunabari camp from 26 December, where almost 2,000 refugees are taking part. Refugee leaders have said that such programme would be extended to other camps as well if their demands were not considered. [passage omitted]
Few days earlier UNHCR carried out demonstration of the use of briquette in Beldangi. A resident at the camp said that it took two hours to boil half litres of water with it. Extra firewood is required to ignite the briquettes, while firewood collection from nearby forests is strictly prohibited by the local authority.
UNHCR officials said they had decided to replace kerosene with briquettes as the price hike of kerosene made it impossible for the agency to manage the costs. It had claimed that briquettes would be better than kerosene for camp residents.
The refugee students are also concerned with their evening studies with the closure of kerosene supply. [passage omitted]
On Monday, member of National Human Rights Commission visited the Beldangi camp and heard the grievances of the refugee community. He also urged the authorities to consider the demands being put forward by them.
The UNHCR has called on the camp secretaries to Chandragadhi in Jhapa for discussion over the issue on Monday.
Over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are languishing in UNHCR-maintained camps in eastern Nepal for the last 15 years.

""We have just transferred the last post held by the multinational force to the Ituri Brigade,"" Colonel Gerard Dubois, spokesman for the French-led European Union force, told reporters.
The Ituri Brigade is the new name of the UN force in the northeastern province, which has been torn apart by ethnic violence since 1999 with the loss of an estimated 50,000 lives.
A platoon of 58 Bangladeshi UN soldiers took control of the post -- located on the road linking the centre of the regional capital, Bunia, to the airport -- from 35 French soldiers serving with the EU peacekeeping force.
The official handover comes on Monday after a two-week transition that started on August 16, when troops from the French-led force gave up a first control post to their UN counterparts.
The EU force, comprised mostly of French troops and called ""Artemis"", was deployed in June to protect civilians after inter-ethnic clashes in the town.
UN peacekeepers in the region at the time were not only outnumbered but also not mandated to open fire to try to quell the violence.
The new UN force will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower at its disposal, including the use of attack helicopters.
Some 2,400 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Indonesia are already in Bunia for the new UN force, according to Abu Thiam, a military spokesman from the UN force.
Some of those were still deploying, he said recently, adding that a Nepalese contingent would bring the total number to around 4,000 from October.

  The offer comes in the wake of a crackdown by the Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) and the district police on drug dealers. It has resulted in a sharp fall in the narcot- trade for the past few months.

"7678",20118291,"Title: Indian quake rescuers blast route to epicentre.rtf; Date: September 20, 2011 Tuesday; Text: SIKKIM, Sept. 20 -- Rescue teams backed by army sappers using explosives tried to force their way Tuesday to the remote epicentre of a powerful Himalayan earthquake that killed 67 people in India, Nepal and Tibet.
Before the grim search for more victims can even begin, the main challenge is to reach the isolated, mountainous impact zone on the border between India's northeastern Sikkim state and Nepal after Sunday's 6.9-magnitude quake.
Convoys of vehicles carrying rescue workers, medical teams and emergency supplies left the Sikkim capital Gangtok at daybreak Tuesday.
But progress was tortuously slow over the narrow, badly damaged roads more often frequented by groups of adventurous tourists heading for Himalayan trekking trails.
After covering just a short section of the 60-kilometre (40-mile) route to the worst-affected districts of Mangan and Sangthan, the convoys came to a complete halt, with the path ahead blocked by a huge rockfall.
As army engineers drilled holes for explosives to try and blow apart the largest boulders, rescuers could only wait in frustration along with distraught locals trying to get through to relatives - unsure whether they were alive or dead.
""I've been here for six hours, waiting for the army to clear the road,"" said Pema Doma, 37, who has heard nothing from her parents or 16-year-old son in Mangan since the quake hit.
""I'd walk if they would let me,"" Doma said. ""The anxiety is killing me. What if he's screaming for me? What if he's calling for me and I can't even hear him?""
Those who did attempt walking around the rockfall were stopped by soldiers, who insisted it was too dangerous to go ahead on foot.
""I know many shortcuts to reach Mangan but the army says it's not safe,"" said P. Sherpa, 62, whose son is a student at the North Sikkim Academy, a private school in Mangan.
""So all we can do is sit here and stare at the rocks,"" he said.
One army official told AFP it could take up to 48 hours to clear the entire stretch of road to the quake epicentre.
One bright spot for the rescue effort was a break in the monsoon weather that allowed a resumption of helicopter flights which had been grounded most of Monday by heavy rains and low cloud.
Air force officials said food packages and small medical teams with doctors and paramedics had been air-dropped into Mangan and Sangthan.
The death toll from building collapses and landslides in Sikkim stood at 35, but Indian Home Secretary R.K. Singh warned the number could rise as emergency relief workers reached far-flung villages.
""We cannot rule out more casualties,"" Singh told a news briefing in New Delhi.
More than 5,000 army troops were mobilised across the state to help clear roads and assist with the relief operation.
The Press Trust of India said 26 tourists, including 15 trekkers, had been rescued and taken to army encampments for their own safety.
Hundreds of Gangtok residents spent a second night out in the open, too scared to sleep in homes badly damaged by the quake.
Many saw out the night in the city's football stadium, slinging plastic sheets over the goalposts or sleeping on the terraces.
""The stadium is our kitchen and bedroom for the night. We're honestly just too scared to consider anything else,"" said Amrita Laqandri, 32, as she helped make tea and warm bread on stoves brought from her family home.
There was some relief as power, cut off by the quake, was restored, but landline and mobile communications remained erratic, especially in the worst-affected areas.
In Nepal, eight people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged in the east of the country, where rescuers faced the same problems as their Indian counterparts with rains and mudslides blocking the only highway.
Seventeen other people died in the Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, while China's official Xinhua news agency said seven people had been killed in southern Tibet, near the border with Sikkim.

Krishna Khattri Chettri was arrested in August 2003 from his hiding place at Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, and had been detained without trial ever since.
""We re-arrested (Chettri) Thursday evening after the Supreme Court's release order as he was facing an arrest warrant for his involvement in a number of state offence cases in and outside Kathmandu,"" said Deputy Inspector General of Police Krishna Basnet.
""(He) was arrested in the presence of human rights activists, civil (society) leaders and several journalists because we have an arrest warrant,"" Basnet told AFP.
Chettri was released after justices on Thursday found he had been detained unlawfully and ordered his immediate release, said a court official who asked not to be named.
But before the student leader left the premises he was re-arrested despite protests by Supreme Court Chief Justice Dilip Kumar Poudel whose demand that police be removed from the court was ignored, the court official said.
Basnet described Chettri as a ""very dangerous person"" closely affiliated with Maoist rebels who since 1996 have waged guerrilla warfare in Nepal in a bid to instal a communist republic.
""We are preparing necessary papers to present (Chettri) at the local court (to be charged) over his involvement in a number of pertinent cases,"" Basnet said.
Chettri was vice president of the pro-Maoist All Nepal Free National Student's Union (Revolutionary) at the time of his detention in 2003.
Accusations of detentions and torture of political opponents by the authorities have risen since King Gyanendra seized absolute power in February in what he said was a move to end the nine-year-old Maoist insurgency that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.

Around a dozen hotel and restaurant workers were arrested after more than 1,000 protesters took to the streets in the tourist area of Thamel, an AFP reporter said.
Other small rallies were staged in the capital and on the main ring road as police shied away from enforcing a ban on all gatherings. Opposition parties who have called an indefinite general strike said the demonstrations were growing.

The protests have since snowballed into daily clashes even though riot police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and baton charges against demonstrators and arrested hundreds of ringleaders.
The government initially tried to prevent large-scale protests by banning public gatherings, calling day and night curfews, cutting mobile phones and rounding up hundreds of political activists.
Under sustained pressure, the king on Thursday called for elections and the royal government has allowed more dissent while restoring services like mobile phones.
But there has been no let up in the strike or protests.
Public transport was unavailable Sunday with inter-city and local bus stands deserted and almost all businesses closed.
Gasoline was scarce and long lines could be seen at the army and police-run pumps, the only ones still open. Prices for vegetables have soared on dwindling supplies.
""Very few trucks supplying food have entered the Kathmandu valley over the past few days,"" said Binaya Shrestha, planning officer of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetables Market Development Board which supplies 325 wholesalers in the capital.
Housewife Rajnai Kumar said the price of onions rose to 100 Nepalese rupees (1.38 dollars) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 25 rupees two days ago.
""How are we going to survive if the price continues to soar?"" she said.
Officials at state-owned Nepal Oil said the strike had cut supplies to the capital.
""Not a single oil tanker has made it to the capital since the first day of the strike,"" a company official said on condition of anonymity.
On Saturday at least 5,000 protestors marched on the ring road, waving flags and chanting anti-royal slogans. The protest briefly turned violent when marchers attempted to enter the city centre.
Once foes, the opposition parties and Maoists entered a loose alliance last November, further isolating Gyanendra.
The rebels, who have been waging a 10-year battle to topple the monarchy, have called a ceasefire in the Kathmandu valley to aid the protest campaign but have continued attacks on security forces elsewhere.
Gyanendra has justified his power grab, which has drawn international criticism, by saying political parties had failed to crush the Maoist revolt that has claimed at least 12,500 lives

"131",20031412,"Title: Free trade accord offers tantalizing prospects for growth in South Asia.rtf; Date: December 29, 2003 Monday; Text: As longtime bitter rivals India and Pakistan try to mend ties, business and political leaders in both neighbor countries are salivating over the potential peace dividends.
Open borders, a common currency and a regional trade boom are among possible results if the two can finally end their half-century of suspicion, hatred and war.
A free trade agreement - expected to be signed next week at the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC - could lead to rapid economic growth in one of the world's poorest regions.
""If confidence is built between India and Pakistan, business will flourish in the entire region,"" said Vinnie Mehta, head of the New Delhi-based Manufacturers Association of Information Technology.
SAARC, which groups India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives, has long been hostage to the hostility between India and Pakistan, its two largest members.
The group was set up in 1985 to promote free trade and economic cooperation in a region that's home to one-fifth of the world's population.
But 18 years later, trade within the region remains abysmally low, amounting to only 5 percent of the member countries' combined global trade.
SAARC members have already missed two deadlines to agree on a South Asian Free Trade Area, in 2001 and 2002, when India-Pakistan hostilities held up the deal.
Trade groups and businesses hope that this time, New Delhi and Islamabad will look beyond their differences and sign the agreement, making the free trade zone operational by January 2006.
""If business relations improve, we will be able to break the impasse between the two countries,"" said Kiran Karnik of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the biggest collective of India's burgeoning information technology powerhouses.
Official India-Pakistan trade totals US$200 million a year, but indirect trade through Dubai or Singapore is estimated at US$1 billion.
Bad blood between India and Pakistan has also kept them from seeing each other as the closest - and often cheapest - source of imports.
Pakistan is a big tea importer, but buys very little from India. Instead, it turns to faraway Kenya or Sri Lanka.
""Just think of the transportation costs that could be saved if we were to send Indian tea by road to Pakistan,"" said Subhash Mittal of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations.
Similar savings are possible if Pakistan imports wheat, sugar, tires, medicines and machines from India. And India could buy fabrics and chemicals from Pakistan.
Ilyas Ahmed Bilour, a Pakistani who is president of the India-Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, sees even greater possible advantages.
""We should be allowed to send Pakistani goods to Bhutan and Bangladesh through the land route across India,"" Bilour said.
Stable relations could lead to joint ventures and long-term investments, said Ajay Khanna of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
Direct India-Pakistan trade alone could quadruple, he said.
""If we were to let our imagination flow, we can look to developing a transshipment cargo hub between Bombay and Karachi (Pakistan's major port), servicing the Middle East, Africa and West Asia,"" said Khanna.
Citing the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean region, where historical differences have been set aside to form regional economic arrangements, Indian and Pakistani leaders have even suggested a common South Asian currency.
Many of the possibilities hinge on India-Pakistan efforts to resolve their competing claims to the Himalayan enclave of Kashmir, which is divided between them and has been the focus of two of their three wars since their 1947 independence from Britain.
Islamic militants have been fighting since 1989 for Muslim-majority Kashmir's independence from mainly Hindu India, or its merger with mostly Muslim Pakistan. More than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed, and the local economy destroyed.
India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the militants, based in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge.
The two nuclear-armed rivals came to the brink of a fourth war in December 2001. But relations are thawing, diplomats are returning and transportation links are resuming. Both countries' leaders are promising dialogue.

At least 27 people were wounded in the attack in the village of Dhankhola, about 250 miles southwest of Nepal's capital, Katmandu.
The police truck was on patrol when it hit a mine in the road, and the rebels opened fire, police officials said. Surviving police fired back.
A passenger bus traveling right behind the police vehicle was caught in the crossfire, and at least four civilians were killed, police said.
The battle lasted for about two hours before reinforcements reached the area. The rebels fled after government soldiers fired from army helicopters.
Police and hospital officials said 14 civilians and 13 police were wounded in the attack. Most were taken to a hospital in Nepalgunj, the nearest big town in the area. Doctors said most of those hospitalized have bullet wounds.
""I saw some people with guns on the hills and yelled at the driver but the explosion hit the police truck, and the rebels began firing indiscriminately. Many passengers were hit,"" Ramesh Shah, a wounded passenger, told The Associated Press from his hospital bed.
Nirmala Baral's 2-year-old son was killed in the attack.
""I was holding my son on my lap. A bullet pierced through the windshield and hit my son on the head … He died on my lap,"" Baral said. Her husband and 3-year-old daughter were wounded.""
It wasn't immediately clear if there were any rebel causalities. Army troops have sealed the highway and were hunting for the attackers in the surrounding jungles.
Fighting between the rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and government forces has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last August.
The rebels have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives.

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 84, is a veteran politician seen as the main driver behind a fragile peace deal that saw the Maoists sign a ceasefire in late 2006.
He has been dogged by health problems since taking office in April 2006, after King Gyanendra was forced to end 14-months of dictatorial rule following protests by mainstream political parties and Maoist rebels.
In June 2006, Koirala underwent prostrate surgery in Bangkok and shortly after he returned was hospitalised in Kathmandu for nine days with pneumonia.

Deuba filed the petition challenging the legality of the Royal Commission for Corruption Control, which was constituted by King Gyanendra after taking over absolute power earlier this year.
Deuba and a colleague were convicted last month of misusing 370 million rupees (US$5.3 million; [euro]4.4 million) while awarding a contract related to a road-building project. The commission sentenced the former prime minister to two years in jail and fined 90 million rupees (US$1.2 million; [euro]990,000). The investigation and trial lasted for three months.
Deuba has been refusing to answer questions by the commission since his arrest in April saying it was an illegally constituted agency.

  Emerging from an hour long meeting with the newly appointed United States ambassador Nancy Powell on Thursday, Deuba demanded that the Maoist-affiliated Young Communist League (YCL) immediately stop the intimidation, extortion and kidnappings which he alleged they were still engaged in to create a conducive atmosphere for holding the polls.
  Deuba's statement has raised political eyebrows, specially because the Nepali Congress's own preparation for the polls is yet to begin. Its units in almost all the 75 districts of the country are either demoralized or totally defunct. Most of its MPs have not visited their constituencies after the May 1999 elections.
  Deuba's charge against the Maoists also contradicts Nepal's Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula's statement that Maoist activities are not a threat to the November elections. Sitaula claimed he was more disturbed about the deteriorating law and order situation in the Terai region.
  Maoist leaders also claimed recently that they were keen to ensure that the constituent assembly election was held as scheduled. Indeed the Maoists are one of the very few political forces in Nepal to have begun preparations for the election in earnest. Their recently held central committee meeting also restructured the organisation for the elections. Frequently dubbed a ""puppet"" of King Gyanendra's, Deuba's move to unify his Nepali Congress (Democratic) with Girija Prasad Koirala's Nepali Congress has also reached a dead end.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's trip to Luoyang, a former imperial capital, came in the midst of a six-day visit to China that both sides describe as an effort to build closer ties after decades of Cold War mistrust.
Relations between Beijing and New Delhi have improved in recent years as they focused on trade, downplaying border disputes and such divisive issues as China's alliance with Pakistan, India's adversary in three wars.
The agreement announced Tuesday calls for China and India to reopen a stretch of their Himalayan border where they fought a 1962 war and have high-level envoys settle other territorial disputes.
Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said the agreement was a ""very important step forward.""
It calls for a reopening of trade between Tibet and the Indian territory of Sikkim.
The status of Sikkim, located between Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, has been a sticking point in relations. Once an independent principality, it was annexed in 1975 by India, but China never recognized it as an Indian possession and claims part of the territory as its own.
The agreement gave no sign that China had recognized Sikkim as Indian territory, and Sinha wouldn't give any more details.
Trade between the two sides totaled US$5 billion (NZ$8.6 billion) last year, and China says its imports from India in the first four months of this year were double the same period of 2002.
In Luoyang, Vajpayee toured the 1,500-year-old Longmen grottos, where thousands of Buddhist figures are carved into cliffs and caves. Buddhism, which originated in India, spread 20 centuries ago to China, where it became a core element of the country's culture.
Vajpayee invoked Buddhism on Monday in a speech in Beijing as a sign of historic Chinese-Indian ties, calling for a modern partnership in trade and diplomacy.
On Tuesday, Vajpayee said President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders were committed to building ""stable, enduring and forward-looking ties of friendship.""
Sinha quoted Hu as telling Vajpayee that his visit sent a message to the world that ""China and India are coming closer together.""
A declaration issued by Vajpayee and his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, said India recognized Tibet as part of China.
It said India won't allow ""anti-China political activities"" by Tibetan exiles, but Sinha said that would not affect the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader who lives in exile in India.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising against communist rule. China accuses him of agitating for independence.

 Kathmandu, Monday 8 December: The controversial National Human Rights Centre was established Monday. The planned establishment of the centre under the prime minister was announced one month ago by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa at a news conference. The sources said the decision to establish the centre was made by a cabinet decision on Thursday 4 December .
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 9 Dec 03 p1
The government appointed Joint Secretary Kul Ratna Bhurtel at the Water and Power Commission as national director and member-secretary. The chairman of the board is the chief secretary and the home, finance, foreign affairs, law, defence, women's affairs, local development and National Planning Commission secretaries are members. For now, the centre secretariat is at the Prime Minister's Office.
 The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and other national and international human rights organizations have protested at the establishment of the centre. It is alleged the government is interfering in the commission's work.
 Talking to the Annapurna Post after his appointment, Bhurtel denied the accusation and said it will implement the recommendations of the NHRC.
 Bhurtel said: ""The centre will only implement the commission's decisions. This is an agency formed for establishment and promotion of human rights."" He said the centre was established to respond to hundreds of letters sent to the prime minister every day by individuals and organizations at home and abroad expressing concern at the human rights situation. He said the centre will help amend prevailing laws to keep them abreast with 16 international treaties that have been signed concerning human rights.
 Bhurtel said the centre will also sent reports on human rights to the United Nations and other international organizations.
 The centre will coordinate with human rights cells in ministries and security agencies. It is also the responsibility of the centre to process complaints received by the cells. Besides this, the centre will help women, Dalits and the oppressed to fight for human rights.
 But NHRC chairman Nayan Bahadur Khatri said it will not tolerate interference from the Centre in its Functioning and if responsibilities overlap. The centre has been established by executive order, while the commission is an independent and autonomous body established by law.
 NHRC, Amnesty International and other national and international human rights organizations have expressed their dissatisfaction and have written to the prime minister to clarify the government position.  passage omitted

Courtney Mitchell (41), and Sarah Welton (48), from Denver, Colorado, celebrated in a Hindu Nepalese tradition at the Dakshinkali Temple, South of Katmandu, the Capital of the Himalayan nation. Local gay rights activists and supporters cheered the ceremony attended by their close friends.
Nepal Parliament member Sunilbabu Pant, a gay rights activist, said it was the first public wedding of a lesbian couple in the mostly conservative nation. Same-sex marriages are not legal in Nepal, where gay couples hid their relationships until recently, when the Supreme Court ordered the Government to legally guarantee sexual rights and end discrimination. The laws are being drafted, but broader political differences have delayed passage.
Pant said while on Monday's wedding did not hold any legal status, ""it was a huge achievement for gay rights campaign in Nepal.""
Pant and his group, called Blue Diamond Society, have been fighting for their rights and have even opened a travel agency hoping to bring in foreign gay couples to come to Nepal for weddings and honeymoon. At the temple, 14 miles (22 km) South of Katmandu, Mitchell wore trousers, a hat and vest while Welton wore a red sari and covered her head with a veil.
A Hindu priest performed the ceremony. The couple put flower garlands on each other while Mitchell put red vermillion powder on Welton's forehead, which is equivalent of exchanging of rings in a Christian wedding.
The guests danced to tunes played by a traditional band . One musician, Sitaram Basiyar, said he has performed at hundreds of weddings but this was his first lesbian wedding.
The couple said they were happy to be married in Nepal and to contribute to the campaign for gay rights in the country. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Pioneer. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

Text of unattributed report headlined ""Why did the Indian PM's special envoy come to Nepal?"" published by Nepalese newspaper Nepalipatra on 20 July
Kathmandu: The purpose of a ""secretive"" visit to Kathmandu by former Indian ambassador to Nepal Shyam Saran as a special envoy of the Indian prime minister, close on the heels of a visit here by Nepal expert Professor S.D. Muni of Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi), has come to light. Saran spent only one night in Kathmandu, and returned after a discreet meeting with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
According to a confidential source, Saran's sudden visit had three main objectives. First, he met with Prime Minister Koirala and suggested that the Nepal government project itself sympathetically towards the terai [southern Nepalese plains] insurgents and protesters. If Kathmandu takes a soft and liberal approach towards the terai insurgents, the problem could be resolved, he said. His second concern was related to the security of industrialists and businessmen of Indian origin. Pointing out that since the advent of democracy in Nepal, industrialists and businessmen of Indian origin had become more insecure and had been greatly troubled by abductions, threats and pressure for donations, he urged Prime Minister Koirala to give special attention to security arrangements for them. The third concern raised by Saran, which is of utmost interest to New Delhi, is China's interest and active role in Nepal. He informed Prime Minister Koirala that India is seriously concerned at the way China has taken the Maoists into confidence of late and is taking a keener interest in Nepal's internal politics.
The source said that earlier the Indian special envoy had nothing to say about how Nepal, which is going through the uncertainties of a transitional period, can free itself of its troubles. According to the source, India is not concerned about Nepal, but it is unnecessarily worried that Nepal's going through an abnormal situation could have consequences for India.

"7526",20116655,"Title: Indian anti-graft yoga guru begins fast to death.rtf; Date: June 4, 2011 Saturday; Text: NEW DELHI, June 4 -- India's most famous yoga guru began a mass fast to the death on Saturday to demand reforms including the death penalty for corrupt officials in an anti-graft campaign that has undermined an embattled and scandal-tainted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
The saffron-robed and bearded Swami Ramdev, who rose from an illiterate family to host a television show with 30 million viewers and owns a ""peace"" island in Scotland, sat with thousands of followers in a tent the size of four football pitches in Delhi.
Tapping into spiraling voter anger at corruption as Asia's third largest economy booms, the guru has called on the government to pursue billions of dollars in illegal funds abroad and the withdrawal of high denomination bank notes.
One newspaper called it ""Yogitation.""
""We are not deviating ... Our issues are black money, corruption,"" Ramdev told a thunderous crowd as he started his hunger strike in a tent where hundreds of ceiling fans whirred in the summer heat. ""And we have to stay firm.""
""Nothing is impossible, everything is possible and we are not going to be defeated.""
His campaign is the latest embarrassment for a Congress party-led coalition hit by graft scandals including allegations of kickbacks at the Commonwealth Games and a telecoms scam that may have cost the government up to $39 billion.
Graft has long been a part of daily life from getting an electricity connection to signing business deals, but the latest scandals - that have seen a minister jailed and business billionaires questioned - are unprecedented.
Such is Ramdev's popularity in the electorally important states of north India that four government ministers, including Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, met him in Delhi after he descended from his private plane to persuade him to stop. Negotiations have so far been fruitless.
Investors worry the latest troubles will again force the government to pay less attention to reform bills, such as making it easier for industry to acquire land, postponed due to opposition protests over graft causing parliamentary deadlock.
Thousands of Indians also fasted in the tent while the guru's followers as far away as the state of Orissa and the city of Mumbai also began hunger strikes.
While many followers are poor, others in the tent were well dressed professionals, mingling with foreign tourists and villagers who had travelled hundreds of miles to see him.
""India is in crisis, crime is up, corruption is up,"" said police constable Jaivir Gurjar, 46. ""The economy is growing but the poor remain poor. Congress party has been in government for most of independent India and look where we are.""
Ramdev's fast comes after a similar one by social activist Anna Hazare, whose April campaign rang a chord with millions of Indians and forced the government to make legislative concessions on an anti-corruption bill that effectively gives India an independent ombudsman to battle graft.
Both campaigns have underscored how India's traditional national parties are struggling to deal with the growing anger at middle class Indians increasingly fed up with graft, leaving a political vacuum that figures like Ramdev can fill.
India ranked 78th on Transparency International's latest corruption index, a worse ranking than China.
POLITICAL AMBITIONS?
Ramdev's yoga demonstrations, filled with crowd-pleasing stunts such as headstands or making his belly dance inside his ribcage, are often punctuated by rambling lectures on corruption, black money or the government's failure to tackle Maoist rebels.
But few expect Ramdev will die for his cause.
Like Hazare, most commentators expect some deal will be forged that will give the yoga guru enough for him to claim moral victory and possibly help the launch of his political party for 2014 elections.
Critics say he is also linked to a radical Hindu nationalist group.
His outspoken positions on homosexuality, which he says is a curable mental illness, and sex education to prevent HIV and AIDS, which he says should be withdrawn from schools and replaced by yoga, have also been criticized.
The Hindu newspaper reported his fast had been planned for months and the organization of his campaign was impressive.
Giant television screens broadcast Ramdev's meditation sessions and speech. There were abundant water supplies laid on in the harsh summer heat.
Paying for it is no problem. His global business has a turnover of $40 million a year.
Politicians fear that outrage over corruption scandals, made all the harder to stomach by rising food and fuel prices, may turn into a national popular movement against the establishment.
India has largely remained unaffected by the violent protests that have rocked emerging economies in the Middle East and North Africa, fueled in part by high prices and corruption.

"2744",20043148,"Title: Wildlife convention approves African hunting quotas for black rhinos.rtf; Date: October 4, 2004 Monday 11:28 AM GMT; Text: A global summit here tasked with regulating trade in endangered species on Monday permitted Namibia and South Africa to each kill five endangered black rhinos per year, a move conservationists warned could lead to wider abuse.
The move will allow wealthy hunters to kill the endangered rhinos and export them as trophies, such as stuffed animals and heads, which would be banned from being resold.
Both countries told the 13th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that only male black rhinos over 30 years old would be targeted, arguing that aging dominant males often prevented younger males from mating, leading to inbreeding and a population slowdown.
But wildlife groups including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the UK-based Born Free Foundation protested the move, warning that it set a dangerous precedent which paved the way for abuse by poachers.
""This says it's alright for a rich white hunter to shoot a rhino for a trophy but not for a local person to use it as a traditional dagger handle or medicine, and if the law seems unjust it is much harder to enforce,"" Born Free spokesman Ian Redmond told AFP.
""There are already too few rhinos in the wild. In the 1960s there was a population of 65,000 and now we're looking at 3,000 or so black rhinos,"" he said.
Countries including the Central African Republic, Mali and Nepal had pushed both nations to consider exporting the animals instead of killing them, a move supported by activists such as Redmond.
""A better use of those so-called surplus animals would be to begin the re-colonisation of former habitats,"" he said.
The WWF also raised concerns about how money earned from the hunting of South Africa's black rhinos would be spent.
""We are not convinced the money generated from the potential income will benefit local communities,"" the WWF said in a statement released after the decision.
Black rhino numbers fell by up to 90 percent during the 1970s and 1980s according to the WWF, which puts the current African population at about 3,600.
The catastrophic decline was caused almost solely by demand for their horns in Middle Eastern and Asian markets, according to the group.
Namibia's quota was raised from 100 to 250 leopards a year, while South Africa's was doubled to 150.
Both nations also had trophy hunting quotas lifted for leopards, which wildlife groups said was a lesser concern because of their abundant numbers.
Some 1,500 delegates have gathered in the Thai capital to debate 50 changes to the global treaty, including limits on trade in species such as the great white shark, the Irawaddy dolphin, and African and Asian elephants.

 Kathmandu, 13 September: Police today apprehended nearly two dozen protesters of the Miss Nepal pageant. One woman was injured in the skirmish between the police and the demonstrating women affiliated to the leftist group Unity Centre-Masal.

Those arrested by the police included Surya Thapa, president of the women's wing of the Unity Centre and its general secretary, Anjana Bisankhe, among others. The injured has been identified as Tara Neupane. She is receiving treatment at the Kantipur Hospital.
 The demonstrating women, who alleged that the pageant is an attempt to commodify women, tore apart banners of the event.
 When informed about the protests outside the venue, a plainly shaken Miss Nepal 2003, Priti Sitaula, expressed concern. However, when asked if the protesters' charges that the whole pageant was merely an advertising gimmick and a forum to degrade women were true, the beauty queen vehemently denied the charges, stating: ""In the past, women were confined to their homes and unable to study or work. We are protesting to break those ossified traditions, and therefore I totally disagree with them.""

England's second successive win inside four days saw them take the third Test in emphatic fashion and gave them an unbeatable 3-0 lead in this four-match series.
It also meant they'd won this series by the two-match margin they needed to replace India at the top of the ICC's Test Championship table. It is the first time England have occupied pole position since the table's creation in 2003.
India were dismissed for 244 in their second innings after man-of-the-match Alastair Cook's career-best 294 had propelled England to a massive first innings 710 for seven declared - their highest Test total in 73 years.
Only Sachin Tendulkar offered any top-order resistance on Saturday with 40 before his latest quest to score an unprecedented 100th international hundred ended in unlucky fashion when he was run-out backing up.
India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni finished on 74 not out and shared a stand of 75 with Praveen Kumar for the eighth wicket, Kumar made 40, his Test-best score coming in just 18 balls with three sixes - all against off-spinner Graeme Swann - and five fours. But the gutsy No 9 was merely delaying the inevitable.
India resumed on 35 for one after losing Virender Sehwag for a 'king pair' to Anderson late on Friday.
Anderson then struck twice early on Saturday to remove both Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid for their overnight scores of 14 and 18 respectively. Dravid, caught behind, seemed uncertain as to whether he'd edged the ball but walked off without reviewing the decision.
New batsman Venkatsai Laxman could only manage two before, pushing tentatively outside off-stump, he too fell to Anderson. That meant the 29-year-old Lancastrian had taken three wickets for 16 runs in 27 balls to leave India 56 for four.
Laxman's exit gave Anderson his 237th Test wicket, one more than the late Sir Alec Bedser, also a fast-medium bowler, as he moved up into seventh place in England's all-time list.
Suresh Raina was then lbw for 10 as he misread Swann's arm-ball. Raina summed up India's mental, as well as physical, tiredness by asking for a review of his dismissal even though, thanks to Indian objections to ball-tracking technology, lbw's cannot be referred in this series.
Tendulkar, who had looked in good touch while striking eight fours, was then run-out after Dhoni drove at Swann only for the bowler to deflect the ball onto the non-striker's stumps with the 'Little Master' just shy of his ground.
India reached lunch on 116 for six, having lost five wickets for 81 runs during Saturday's morning session.
And that became 130 for seven when Amit Mishra was well caught by a leaping Stuart Broad at mid-off following a drive against Swann.
Kumar - primarily a medium-pacer and one of the few India players to show much fight with either bat or ball this series - was eventually out when he top-edged a pull off seamer Broad and was caught by Ravi Bopara.
Tim Bresnan then ensured an India side boasting one of the world's strongest top-orders, who've yet to make 300 this series, were bowled out inside 56 overs when he dismissed last man Shanthakumaran Sreesanth.

The ministers, who served under King Gyanendra, were detained on the recommendation of a judicial commission investigating alleged human rights violations during anti-monarchy protests in April.
Ministers of the king's regime have been blamed for ordering a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in which 19 people died in April, before the king gave up his dictatorial powers after 14 months
The ministers Ramesh Nath Pandey, Nichhya Sumshere Rana and Srish Sumshere Rana had filed a petition challenging the new government's decision to detain them.
The court said it found no evidence or basis to continue the ministers' detention and the judges ordered their immediate release.
Two other ministers who were detained did not file a petition and remain in jail.
Weeks of deadly street protests in April forced Gyanendra to give up direct control of the government, reinstate Parliament and return political authority to elected officials.
Gyanendra fired the country's prime minister in February 2005, citing a need to clamp down on corruption and stamp out a communist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people in the past decade.

A total of 75 people were killed by both the state and Maoists during the three month period of the Maoists' unilateral cease-fire from 3 September to 2 December.  According to a report, released by Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC), 62 people were killed by security forces whereas 13 died in the hands of Maoists.
The report entitled: ""Three Months of Cease-fire - An Assessment of Human Rights Situation during the Unilateral Cease-fire by CPN [Communist Party of Nepal] - (Maoist) in Nepal"", said that though number of killings from the Maoists has gone down there has been rise on incidents of abduction. It also stated that Maoists abducted 8,777 people, mostly teachers and students, during the three-month long ceasefire.
""Maoists continued targeting schools affecting more than 30,000 students in various parts of the country during the same period,"" the report said. The report further said that Maoists targeted schools a lot. Community schools were the most to be affected. This has directly violated child's right to education. Study of more than 30,000 students was affected by such closure called by the Maoists.
""The Maoists were also found beating civilians, students and even human rights defenders.

They looted medicine from a health post in Ramechhap district,"" the report adds.
The report also accused security forces of intensifying their activities in villages arresting citizens and making them disappear. The report also said security forces arrested at least 214 persons from 35 districts on charge of being Maoists and re-arrested 36 persons from 11 districts, ignoring court orders to release them.
The report also charged both the conflicting parties for not being serious in establishing peace by respecting the commitment and obligation on human rights and humanitarian laws and urged both the parties to effectively implement their public commitments and national, as well as international legal obligations on human rights and humanitarian laws and respect rights of the people to live in a fearless environment and to take part in their social life.

KATHMANDU, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite some solace from international media that honored Nepal as one of the few outbound destinations with exotic natural beauties, the year 2002 proved to be one of the most painful years for Nepali tourist industry.
Two international airlines canceled services to Nepal, significant number of tourism dependants turned jobless and total tourist arrivals hit rock-bottom in 2002.
According to statistics of Nepal Tourism Board, the total number of tourists visiting Nepal in 2002 decreased by 28 percent compared with that in 2001. Altogether 215,922 visitors from different parts of the world came to Nepal by air in 2002, while the figure in the previous year stood at 298,456.
Nepali tourist industry's traditional markets such as the United States, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands got declines of 4 percent, 18 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent respectively.  The number of tourists from China also decreased by 21 percent.
The total tourist arrivals from the countries other than India recorded a heavy decline of 36 percent from 234,256 to 150,293, the sharpest decline in recent years.
Nepali tourist industry had recorded a similar decline in the total tourist arrivals during the previous year also. The number of tourists plunged by 20.7 percent in 2001 compared with the figure in 2000.
Most of the tourist entrepreneurs in Nepal blame the declining of tourism on political instability and security problems, especially the anti-government insurgents' violence.
The year 2002 witnessed a total of 39 days of insurgent-called ""bandh"" (strikes), including 15 days of nationwide general strikes and 17 days of educational strikes throughout the kingdom.
""The bandhs are suicidal for Nepal's ailing tourist and hospitality industry and even cause the two reeling industries to collapse. Nepal's image in the international market has also further deteriorated,"" complained Narendra Bajracharya, president of the Hotel Association of Nepal.
On the other hand, tourist entrepreneurs believe that there are other factors responsible for the decline of the tourist industry.
The quality of service, regular flight services and new places for trekking, rafting and travelling also have to be given priority, if Nepal is to revive its tourist industry, said Aditya Baral, publicity manager of Nepal Tourism Board.
With an aim to come up with new measures to boost the ailing tourism sector, the Nepali government has announced a two-year Destination Nepal Campaign in 2002 and 2003. ""But the government's inadequate homework led to the delay in real launching of the program,"" Baral noted.
""Lack of budget has been the major constraint to publicize Nepal's full potential in adventure, trekking and mountaineering,"" he explained, adding ""Anyhow, quality service is one of the main points for the revival of Nepal's tourist industry.""

The official, who asked not to be named, said Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey would lead the Nepalese delegation.
Some reports said Gyanendra, who seized power in February, had cancelled plans to attend the UN meeting due to the volatile situation.
""The king was to leave Kathmandu this week to attend the UN General Assembly as the leader of the Nepalese delegation via Frankfurt and all arrangements have been cancelled,"" the Kathmandu Post said.
However, the daily Rajdhani (Capital) quoted Foreign Minister Pandey as saying the king had never intended to go to New York.
""His majesty has no plans to visit the UN to address the General Assembly though it has been much publicised in the local media,"" Pandey said.
Another government source said that since the visit of the king to the US had never been announced, ""the question of ... cancelling does not arise.""
However, members of the 54-strong delegation, which comprises senior government officials, businessspeople and travel tour promoters, told AFP they had initially been told the monarch would be heading the delegation.
Opposition parties had strongly objected to any such royal trip and warned he would face protests by rights activists in New York.
There was also expectation he would come under fire from other world leaders for assuming full executive powers in the Hindu kingdom.
Nepal has been in turmoil since the power grab, during which the king backed by the army launched a crackdown on dissidents, rounding up hundreds of activists and clamping down on the media.
A state of emergency declared when the king took over was lifted in April but many curbs on freedom remain.
Gyanendra said the move was aimed at ending a bloody Maoist rebellion which has seen more than 12,000 people killed since it was launched in 1996.

 The government's call for elections is a plot against the democratic forces, the Nepali Congress said today Friday 24 October . Addressing cadres at a tea party here Kathmandu , General Secretary of the NC Nepali Congress Party Sushil Koirala said, ""Elections are nothing but the government's ploy to lengthen its tenure."" Koirala wondered how polls could be possible at such a critical situation when the whole country was facing Maoists violence.

Koirala also did not spare the Maoists for terrorising party cadres in the districts. He, however, urged the cadres to continue their fight against regression to establish democratic norms and values in the country. ""The movement against regression will not end unless the regression is reversed and the democratic system restored."" Koirala said while reiterating the party's demands for reinstating the House of Representatives.
 Much on the same line of logic of the five political parties, Koirala said the current imbroglio will come to an end after the parliament is restored and an all-party government formed. While the Nepali Congress has said restoration of the House of Representatives was a priority, the CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist has mainly been emphasizing on the formation of an all-party government which it claims would help re-establish the democratic system in the country.
 Koirala also said the democratic forces will ""not compromise"" with anybody for the sake of democracy. Indicating that the joint mass movement would be effectively resumed after the Chhat festival a festival popular among the people living in the southern plains or Terai region , Koirala said the movement would bring back people's rights.
 The NC has been under criticism from the other three small parties, especially the Janamorcha Nepal and the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party, for inviting the prime minister and other ministers during the tea party hosted by the NC during Dashain Hindu festival .

  The PM was speaking at the platinum jubilee passing out parade of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) here on Monday. Singh said the UPA government was fully committed to technological modernisation of the armed forces.
  ""We will not shy away from investing whatever is required in the training and equipment of our armed forces. While the government will find the resources required, the leadership of our armed forces must focus attention on improving efficiency of the expenditure,"" he said.
  The Prime Minister also assured that his government would make efforts to improve service conditions in the armed forces in order to attract bright young men and women to opt for a career in the defence services.
  Stressing on the importance of science and information technology in modern warfare, Singh spoke about the need for better education and training for officers and soldiers in order to become ""thinking machines"".
  Speaking on the role of institutions like IMA, he urged them to develop intellectual and organisational framework for ""jointness in action and thinking"" and ways to instill correct leadership values in the officers.
  ""The second role of an institution like the Indian Military Academy would be to instill a respect for knowledge and learning. Constant learning and relearning are necessary to remain relevant in a fast changing world,"" said Singh.

The guerrillas announced Wednesday that a ceasefire in place since January 29 and sputtering peace talks had ""no significance"" after the government rejected an ultimatum supporting their key demand of an assembly to redraft the constitution.
A similar ceasefire in 2001 broke down over demands that the kingdom's constitutional monarchy be abolished, triggering a violent phase in the insurgency that left 90 police officers and soldiers dead in just one day.
""We have terminated the peace process, along with the ceasefire and the code of conduct (which governs the truce) for the time being because of the government's undemocratic posture,"" said a statement from Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda (The Fierce).
He did hint that talks could resume ""in the event that people's sovereign rights and basic interests are re-established,"" although he did not elaborate.
Social reform activist and political analyst Bhakatendra Thapa said the window left open by Prachanda for rebels to return to talks meant they were waiting to see what concessions the government would tender.
""The Maoists have not closed the door on future negotiations. This withdrawal is because they want to be sure to their demand of a constituent assembly is fulfilled,"" he said.
A cabinet source said the government had put the proposal of a constituent assembly to King Gyanendra and was awaiting his views on the matter.
Three rounds of peace talks since the ceasefire, the latest coming last week, have failed to galvanise action to end the Maoists' seven-year ""people's war"" that has claimed the lives of more than 7,800 people.
Long-awaited talks broke down completely last week over the issue of the constituent assembly and the Maoists' anger at the military killing of a group of rebels in the eastern Ramechhap district even as talks were underway.
The rebels said 19 of their cadres died in a military attack, while the army maintains its troops were acting in self-defence when they fired on, and killed, 17 Maoists. A three-person government team is investigating.
Talks facilitator Daman Nath Dhungana said he was not surprised by the Maoist withdrawal from the peace process.
""Both the government and the Maoists had been violating the code of conduct,"" he said.
""The Ramechhap incident in fact ruined the talks.""

"4591",20062855,"Title: Rebels attack government bases near Katmandu , killing 2, wounding 10.rtf; Date: February 7, 2006 Tuesday 2:34 AM GMT; Text: Communist rebels attacked government bases in a town near the Nepalese capital, killing at least two security forces and wounding 10 in the overnight assaults, officials said on Tuesday.
The rebels raided an army camp, police post and government buildings in Panauti, only 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Katmandu, in fighting that began late Monday and continued Tuesday morning, when army helicopters and reinforcements arrived to assist government troops.
One army soldier and one policeman were killed, and 10 were wounded in the violence, said Sambhu Koirala, the chief administrative official in the area.
Maoist rebels have intensified attacks in their attempt to foil government plans to hold local elections on Wednesday, and have called a nationwide general strike for the entire week to disrupt the polls.
The elections for mayors and ward council members posts with little power and few responsibilities have been billed as a small, but symbolic step back toward democracy a year after King Gyanendra seized absolute power.
The government has given assurances it will tighten security but rebel attacks have continued.
The rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 for a socialist state, have already been blamed for killing at least two candidates and attacking several others.
King Gyanendra seized absolute power last February, saying he needed the authority to quell the insurgency, which has taken 12,000 lives in the past decade. The royal government has since rounded up hundreds of opposition politicians and activists.

"4630",20066967,"Title: Militia groups in eastern Congo to lay down arms, violence at election rally in capital.rtf; Date: July 27, 2006 Thursday 4:23 PM GMT; Text: Three main militia groups in strife-torn eastern Congo have agreed to lay down their arms ahead of historic elections this weekend, the U.N. said Thursday, offering a glimmer of hope the same day clashes at a campaign rally left at least one person dead and underlined tensions in this vast nation.
Sunday's elections were Congo's first multiparty balloting for a head of state since independence in 1960, and the first vote since a series of civil wars between 1996 and 2002 that drew in several of this country's neighbors. Voters will replace a transitional president and parliament that have led the country since a 2002 peace agreement that ended fighting in most of the country, though not in the east.
The violence Thursday followed a fire of undetermined origin at a camp for militiamen attached to a main Congolese presidential candidate, who was holding a campaign rally at a stadium elsewhere in Kinshasa Thursday. There appeared to be no serious injuries, though most of the shacks that made up the camp were destroyed.
Gunfire broke out outside the stadium when word reached the crowd there of the fire at the camp, where militiamen lived with their families. Reporters saw at least six people wounded at the stadium, and said police were firing tear gas and that a fire had broken out at a church near the stadium.
A witness, driver Jose Kavata, said he saw a mob outside the stadium grab a police officer and set fire to him, killing him.
Candidate and former rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba was just approaching the stadium when the melee erupted. He later addressed about 20,000 people inside. Thousands of people had marched from Kinshasa's airport for the rally, though some left before Bemba spoke because of the unrest.
""I couldn't allow people to suffer anymore. I had to take up arms against dictatorship,"" Bemba told the crowd, referring to his past as a rebel leader.
In announcing eastern militiamen were handing over their arms, Kemal Saiki, a spokesman for the 17,600-troop peacekeeping force in Congo, said: ""Anything that contributes to peace in Congo is good news.""
But Saiki cautioned that other armed groups still exist in eastern Congo the site of one of the world's worst humanitarian crises despite the official end to war in 2002.
Gen. Mbuayama Nsiona, the commander in charge of army operations in Ituri, said the three eastern militia groups that have agreed to disarm included one led by Peter Karim, whose agreement had been previously announced.
Karim's militia was accused of capturing and later releasing seven Nepalese peacekeepers in May and is believed to include thousands of fighters. Army officials had said Karim will become a colonel in the army under the deal that saw him disarm.
""We are doing all we can for the vote to pass peacefully. The agreements with these militias will allow people to vote en masse on Sunday,"" Nsiona said.
But Anneke Van Woudenberg of Human Rights Watch, who was in Bunia Thursday morning, said her group was ""very concerned"" at such dealmaking.
""This will not bring peace to Ituri,"" she said. ""It sends a signal that if you want to become a colonel, you should pick up your gun and kill people.""
Nsiona said about 500 men led by Cobra Matate also were laying down arms, as were members of the Congolese Revolutionary Movement, a coalition formed in December under Mathieu Ngudjolo and accused of most of the recent attacks. Nsiona said it was unclear how many people were in the coalition now, after about 3,500 were disarmed over the past month.
Thursday morning, Nsiona said Ngudjolo was just outside Bunia with 250 militiamen preparing to hand over their arms, but that negotiations on details were still being worked out. He said it was risky to allow the militiamen so close to Bunia, but believed they were negotiating in good faith.
U.N. spokesman Saiki cautioned that other armed groups still exist in eastern Congo.
The U.N. and Congolese forces have been trying to quell violence in the east that aid groups say contribute the needless deaths of some 1,000 civilians each day, most through strife-related disease or hunger.
Thousands of rebel and militia fighters have joined the military under a postwar, transitional administration led by President Joseph Kabila, but unknown numbers still fight in the countryside of the vast Central African nation. And the army has been accused of preying on civilians, in part because it is made up of so many former militiamen whose discipline is low and whose loyalties are suspect.
The U.N. said Wednesday that political violence and human rights abuses rose ahead of the watershed vote, and that government security forces were responsible for most of the violations. The U.N. report covered January to June 2006.
President Joseph Kabila earlier acknowledged abuses by his security services, but blamed them on rogue elements and vowed any alleged crimes would be prosecuted.

 Nepal and India have expressed commitment to cooperate each other in stemming terrorist activities. This was stated in a joint press statement issued at the end of the five-day official tour of Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to India Sunday 12 September .
 Along with the commitment to cooperate each other in the fight against terrorism, Nepal and India have reached agreements on a range of issues and have expressed commitment to implement the agreements and understandings at the earliest.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 12 Sep 04
Deuba and his Indian counterpart Dr Manmohan Singh signed the joint statement at a function held in New Delhi today.
 It is mentioned in the 25-point joint statement that Nepal and India have expressed commitment to enhance bilateral trade and investment, cultural exchange, tourism promotion, cooperation in utilization of the water resources, border security and border management. Likewise, India has pledged help for the construction of the Raxaul-Amlekhganj oil pipeline and expansion of railway network in Nepal. As per the agreement, an Indian team will soon arrive in Nepal to select suitable location for the construction of a technical institute in the far-western region.
 Both sides have also consented to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) of the Budhigandaki hydropower project and foster joint investment in the Upper Karnali power project and Pancheshwor multipurpose project.
 The Joint Border Management Committee has been directed to complete its stint by June next year and the high-level joint committee formed to oversee the inundation problems in Nepalese parts has been asked to speed up its works, the press release states. The release further mentions that home secretaries of both the countries will soon meet to find ways to curb cross-border crime and enhance exchange of legal aid.
 Talking to Nepalese media persons in New Delhi today, Deuba said the talks with Indian leaders were focused mainly on the issue of restoring peace in Nepal. He claimed that the meeting was very fruitful in bolstering mutual understanding between the two countries.
 Deuba is scheduled to fly back home with his 66-member convoy this evening.

"3369",20045242,"Title: Kuwaiti employer of Turkish hostage says it stopped sending trucks to Iraq.rtf; Date: September 5, 2004 Sunday; Text: Two transport companies announced Sunday they have stopped doing business in Iraq in an attempt to secure the release of a Turkish driver taken hostage by Iraqi militants.
""As of this morning, I stopped all my trucks from entering Iraq,"" Ghassan Jasim Abbel, owner of the Kuwait Falcon Co. , told The Associated Press.
Abbel said he had not yet had any contact, directly or indirectly, with the kidnappers.
Kuwait Falcon contracted with a Turkish transport company, Renay International based in Antakya, southern Turkey, for some hauls in Iraq. Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported that Renay, also was ending its Iraq work.
""Our company is ending activities in Iraq. We hope that our driver is safely returned to our country and to his family,"" Anatolia quoted Edip Rende, a partner in Renay as saying.
Anatolia identified the captured Turk as Mithat Civi, a 48-year-old father of three who had been working in Kuwait but left for Iraq a month ago.
A videotape aired Saturday on al-Arabiya television demanded Kuwait Falcon Co. cease its operations in Iraq within 48 hours or a Turkish truck driver employed by the company would be beheaded. The tape showed a man it said was the driver sitting in front of a banner with the militant group's name, the Islamic Resistance Movement-Al-Noaman Brigades, in gold lettering.
Militants waging a violent 16-month insurgency in Iraq increasingly have turned to kidnapping foreigners in an effort to drive out coalition forces and contractors.
In a separate kidnapping case last week, a tape showing three Turkish hostages being killed was sent to Al-Jazeera TV from the Tawhid and Jihad militant group, which is linked to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant held responsible for a string of bombings, kidnappings and other attacks in Iraq. Militants recently also have killed an Italian journalist and 12 Nepalese workers; seven truckers from India, Kenya and Egypt were released after their Kuwaiti employer paid a $500,000 ([euro]415,000) ransom.

  Confirming the report, Baman Prasad Neupane, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Affairs said the bomb exploded in the house of Tara Bahadur Khandamagar, at Bhutuke village, about 35 kms south-east of Tansen, the district headquarters.
  Khandamagar's house was completely destroyed in the explosion, Neupane said. A bomb disposal team has been rushed to the spot as more bombs are believed to be stored in the village.
  Jhin Prasad Dhakal, the superintendent of police of Palpa district said the bomb is believed to be one among the many others hidden in Khandamagar's house when the Maoists were fighting a bush war against the King of Nepal. The villagers recovered the bodies, which were trapped under the debris. In addition to bomb squad and police personnel, human rights activists have also rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation.
  The explosion has led to panic in Bhutuke, and people have started vacating the village. The district administration has urged the people not to panic, adding that the situation was under control.

Media consortium to disband vote-counting operation
 
NEW YORK (AP) - Six major news organizations announced Jan. 13 the breakup of Voter News Service, the consortium they had built to count votes and conduct surveys on Election Day. The decision follows two major election-night failures in a row by VNS.
Given the expense of mounting such operations on their own, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and The Associated Press said they were considering other options for sharing vote counts and exit poll surveys.
But it will no longer be VNS, an operation that was created in 1993.
In November 2000, flawed information from VNS twice led television networks to incorrectly declare a winner in the presidential race in Florida, the state that proved to be key to the outcome. The results there were not determined until weeks later after recounts and a court battle that was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore.
Following that embarrassment, VNS contracted with Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio-based research company, to rebuild its system. But in the 2002 election, VNS was unable to provide its members and other clients with results from exit poll surveys. This material is used to help make projections of winners and to supplement the vote count with an analysis of why people voted as they did.
""The project is very large and there was a feeling that the mission of VNS could be better accomplished by working with multiple outside companies,"" said Bill Wheatley, executive vice president of NBC News.
VNS was headed by former CBS News executive Ted Savaglio and has had about 30 permanent employees. Savaglio could not immediately be reached for comment.
The dissolution of VNS means that the system Battelle was building will not be completed, according to a network executive who spok"
"2902",20044225,"Title: Nepal steps up security after bombing at American center.rtf; Date: September 11, 2004 Saturday; Text: Nepal heightened security around Western diplomatic missions Saturday, a day after suspected communist rebels bombed an American culture center minutes after it closed for the weekend.
No one was injured when two homemade bombs exploded Friday at the American Information Center in the capital, Katmandu, but parts parts of the building were damaged.
Eyewitnesses reported seeing two attackers tossing the improvised explosives from the parking lot behind the building before running away into an alley, police said.
Home Ministry officials in Katmandu said extra police were deployed around Western embassies and other foreign agencies to prevent further attacks.
Police said they suspect Maoist rebels were responsible. No suspects have been detained and investigations continued Saturday.
If the rebels were to blame, it would mark the first time that they directly attacked an American government target.
The United States is Nepal's biggest backer in its war against the Maoist guerrillas, who have fought since February 1996 to replace the monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
The American Information Center is funded by the U.S. government, and acts as a cultural exchange organization in Nepal. Both Americans and Nepalese work there.
In Washington, U.S. State Dept. Spokesman Richard Boucher said the American Embassy in Nepal was working closely with Nepalese authorities to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
""I would point out, once again, this kind of attack has no political or other justification,"" said Boucher. ""We will continue to review information pertaining to the safety and security of American citizens.""
U.S. State Department travel warnings on Nepal issued in July said the American Embassy received information that the Maoists may attempt attacks against U.S. citizens.
The rebels also have threatened U.S.-backed humanitarian organizations. Most U.S. aid groups have already scaled back or withdrawn staff.
Fighting between the rebels - who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong - and government forces has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire in August last year.

"1546",20043246,"Title: Tracking down Nepal 's communist rebels in a land of timeless beauty and uncertain reality_1.rtf; Date: July 3, 2004, Saturday, BC cycle; Text: A trek deep into this Himalayan kingdom is a bit like stepping into Alice's rabbit hole and stumbling along a path that takes you to a land of physical grandeur, hard poverty and the slow rhythms of an ancient way of life - but one that exists alongside the modern clash of political ideology.
My colleague Ami and I - both photojournalists - decided to take Nepal's Maoist rebels up on a general invitation for outsiders to visit areas where they have pushed out government control in a war that has caused more than 9,000 deaths since 1996.
When just about everyone else has given up on communism, it's flourishing in parts of Nepal. Rebels are setting up farm cooperatives, rewriting school curriculums and following other programs once espoused by Mao Zedong for rural China - a proletariat dream that has been swept away by the Chinese embrace of capitalism.
After several days of trying to snag seats on a flight into Nepal's heartland, we opted to make a 15-hour drive west from Katmandu, the capital, to the town of Nepalganj and grab a plane there.
We stopped to pick up our fixer, a local journalist named Rudra. He came with color TV, desktop computer and some smaller electronic items. He smiled and climbed aboard the rented Indian-made jeep; rides are hard to come by and he wasn't about to pass up a chance to carry these modern conveniences to his family.
After a grueling drive, during which we had to occasionally push the jeep along the bumpy road, we caught a twin-prop Royal Nepal airliner that took us from the heat of Nepalganj into the mountainous district of Rukum, where the Maoists have created a state of their own.
As we got off, dozens of people carrying bundles swarmed the plane, elbowing to grab seats and leave the barbed wire-enclosed 1 1/2 square miles that is the only government-controlled area in the district.
We passed through a military checkpoint, and started to walk up into the hills against a backdrop of soaring mountains.
We were never alone. One or two people always attached themselves to us. They wanted to know where we were from, where we were going and what we wanted to see. Some asked Ami and I - both in our 30s - if we were teenagers, since our skin has been spared the weathering that marks people living high in the mountains.
Others, when they found out I am Mexican, were curious about the Zapatista rebels who have carved out an enclave in the jungles of Mexico's southernmost state, Chiapas.
Rudra warned us that some, if not all, the questioners were spies, but figuring out who was a government informant, who was a Maoist agent and who was just a curious villager was nearly impossible.
Four hours of walking brought us to our first stop, the village of Chhiban, where Rudra was born.
Climbing over a hill - the last one Rudra promised us and our aching legs - we crossed into a valley of wheat fields surrounding clusters of four or five red-adobe houses with thatch roofs, many of them two stories. Each had a corral or barn for water buffalo, goats, chickens and the occasional horse and a small circle out front for threshing wheat. Some had berry bushes to supplement diets.
With the light from the setting sun turning golden, we were greeted by Rudra's extended family at the narrow river that waters the valley. Children crossed over with little brothers and sisters tightly strapped to their backs, hopping across a plank of wood like lithe tightrope walkers.
Life in this part of the world comes with few creature comforts. We spent the night cuddled on a board in a room next to a home's grain storage room, sharing our space with a variety of bedbugs.
In the morning, Ami, Rudra and I set off on a three-day trek to look for the leaders of the rebels, whose contact name we got from some teachers who had been kidnapped by Maoists and later let go.
We met contacts who led us to new contacts. We were questioned by junior Maoists, and by senior Maoists.
They spoke enthusiastically of their movement's drive to create a new world, ""a money-less state where crime will be uprooted by the abolishment of the class system.""
While insisting they are non-dogmatic, officers said education must be revamped and teachers re-educated.
They also talked of the need for compulsory military training. ""It's a time of war. That is why all of the people need to take army training, be it teachers or businessmen,"" one said.
We also got to talk with civilians, some who support the rebels and some who seem to have doubts.
While staying at the home of a pregnant woman, she asked, ""Why have you been kidnapped?"" Told that we were there on our own, she looked puzzled, then shook her head. Later we learned her husband had been taken away by the rebels 11 days earlier because he didn't want to be a part of the movement any longer.
In the town of Nepalganj, we visited a small orphanage for 52 girls and boys, ages 3 to 16, who have lost their parents to the troops of one side or the other. Boys kicked around a s"
"951",20032219,"Title: Nepal Maoists say ceasefire effectively over.rtf; Date: August 27, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Maoist rebels said Wednesday a seven-month truce was effectively over after Nepal's government refused to agree to their key demand of a constitutional assembly.
""The significance of the ceasefire has now ended,"" said a Maoist statement quoted to AFP by Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a rebel-appointed go-between in the peace process.
The Maoists had given the government a Wednesday deadline to agree to elections for a ""constituent assembly"" that would redraft Nepal's constitution.
But the government refused, saying the rebels must first give up their weapons.
The assembly dispute helped scuttle a long-delayed third round of peace talks last week. The two sides agreed a ceasefire on January 29.

 'They would not be released until our leaders are set free.
We are treating them as prisoners of war,' the Kantipur newspaper quoted Pasang, commander of the rebels' western division, as saying.
 Maoist-controlled radio in western Nepal also said Monday that the detained policemen and official would be released only in exchange for Matrika Yadav, Suresh Alemagar and Tilak Sharma, the newspaper reported.
 In one of the bloodiest attacks in the Myagdi district of central Nepal, the rebels killed hundreds of army soldiers and police officers Saturday and Sunday, the Maoists' supreme leader Puspakamal Dahal said.
 The leader, known as Prachanda, is head of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) and supreme commander of the rebels' People's Liberation Army.
 Pasang said 32 policemen and one senior local government official were captured.
 The government, meanwhile, said 56 policemen and one senior local government official are missing following the rebel attack.
 It has also claimed the Nepalese army killed more than 500 insurgents and injured 200 others in the fighting.

 Kathmandu, Sunday 30 March: Sitting quietly on a chair inside a posh Kathmandu hotel, his hands fiddling with the microphone, his piercing eyes surveying the scene before him, Dr Baburam Bhattarai cut an impressive if unlikely figure.
 Leader of the Maoist negotiating team, he is also a feared rebel leader, one of their main ideologues and a man who, along with topmost rebel leader Prachanda, has gained near-mythological status since the Maoists launched their violent ""People's War"" campaign seven years ago.
 But here in Kathmandu, a day after emerging publicly for the first time in seven years, it was difficult to imagine that this was the same person whose calls to arms for political change had affected the lives of thousands of people and caused so much turmoil in the country.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 31 Mar 03
Exuding confidence and even exhibiting a slight touch of humour, Dr Bhattarai on Sunday appeared before the foreign and domestic press to once again explain the Maoists' goals. His intense personality would have made it easy to overlook the presence of other Maoist luminaries had they not been as important a player in the movement as he is. Flanking Dr Bhattarai were the Maoists' top military brains, Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) and Dev Gurung, as well as political leaders Matrika Prasad Yadav and Krishna Bahadur Mahara. But the forum clearly belonged to the bearded architect-turned-revolutionary.
 Speaking in measured tones rather than the staccato bursts which characterized his first press conference yesterday, the immaculately dressed Dr Bhattarai lost no time in getting over with the niceties and into the heart of the matter.
 The Maoists would like all the political parties which believe in parliamentary democracy to be included in the peace negotiations, he said. The reality of the country demands that. According to Dr Bhattarai, there exists two states with two armies within the country but three major political forces which are operational - the monarchical force, the Maoists and the political parties which believe in parliamentary democracy.
 ""There will be no political solution if one of the forces is left out. So we will try our utmost to get the political parties involved,"" said Dr Bhattarai, adding that the Maoists had enough patience and would work to get the political parties to come onboard. But he also spelt out where the Maoists differed with the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) .
 Referring to demands by the political parties to either revive the dissolved House of Representatives or form an all-party government under the present constitution, Dr Bhattarai said: ""The reality is that the old constitution is dead. They (political parties) say, restore it. But how can you restore it? This is what they don't understand. They must come forward to build a new constitution.""
 And how do you draw a new constitution? The rebel leader explained that the first step would be to start the official peace negotiations, followed by a round-table conference of all political parties and movements which would then form an all-party government with the mandate to hold elections to a constituent assembly.
 ""Constitutional assembly is a means, not the end. We want to create a political system where all forces and movements are represented. The new political system we envision will go beyond the present multi-party system. We are absolutely clear that there will be no return to the status quo or to the situation that prevailed before 1990 People's Movement,"" he said.
 He added that the Maoists also favoured the re-drawing of electoral constituencies so as to give adequate representation to all peoples. And he even indicated that there could be a proportional electoral system rather than the first-past-the-post system in place now. But what if the elected constituent assembly fails to include the Maoists' ideals in the new constitution? ""If the election is freely held, then naturally we will abide by it,"" he said.
 Asked to explain if republican ideals remained the Maoists' ultimate goal, Dr Bhattarai said that though republican communism remained the party's long-term goal, the Maoists are ready to compromise. ""That is our long-term goal. But as far as present balance of political forces is concerned, there may be some give and take. We don't know right now what that will be...We want to explore it further…  ellipsis as published It is a reality that the monarchy is a political force at present.""
 The Maoist leader then urged the monarch to make some sacrifices. ""The king should make some sacrifices. Then his name can be written in history in golden letters. Unless he makes the necessary sacrifices, it will be difficult for him to maintain control,"" Dr Bhattarai said. Pressed to explain what such sacrifices might be, Dr Bhatta"
"434",20031259,"Title: Iranian twins say their fate up to God as risky separation surgery begins.rtf; Date: July 6, 2003, Sunday, BC cycle; Text: A pair of 29-year-old Iranian twin sisters who are joined at the head began a marathon operation Sunday that could finally separate them - or could kill one or both.
After a lifetime of compromises on everything from when to wake up each day to what career to pursue, Ladan and Laleh Bijani said they preferred to face the dangers of the surgery - which could last up to four days - rather than continue living joined together.
""If God wants us to live the rest of our lives as two separate, independent individuals, we will,"" Ladan said Saturday.
The twins had said they wanted to walk into the operating room at Singapore's Raffles Hospital as a sign of courage, but they were brought in by wheelchair because they were too tired to stand, hospital spokesman Dr. Prem Kumar told reporters.
""The twins were wheeled into the operating theater and the medical team is now administering anesthesia to the twins,"" Kumar said.
An international team of 28 doctors and about 100 medical assistants will participate in the surgery, which will last at least 48 hours and could take four days.
""It's going to be a good day,"" the lead neurosurgeon, Dr. Keith Goh, said as he arrived at the hospital Sunday morning. He said he and his wife spent the morning praying for the twins.
The Bijani sisters, born in Firouzabad, southern Iran, in 1974, have separate brains that lie next to each other in a joined skull. Their heads are connected but their bodies are otherwise distinct.
The twins have wanted to be separated ever since they first opened their eyes, Ladan told a news conference last month. They told reporters they long for simple things such as seeing each other's face.
On Saturday, Ladan said they would spend the hours before the operation reading the Quran and performing ritual Muslim ablutions. ""We feel closer to God that way,"" she said.
Before the operation, doctors conducted four hours of last-minute tests on the sisters to study how blood flows through their brains.
The tests revealed a new medical reason for the surgery to proceed, Goh said on Saturday. The pressure inside the twins' brains was more than twice what it should be.
The discovery led doctors ""to believe this is something quite necessary, not cosmetic or frivolous,"" Goh told a news conference late Saturday.
""Rest assured, we're all here to help you. Please stay positive,"" Carson, the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, told the sisters when he met them on the eve of the operation, according to a hospital statement.
The sisters each have a 50-50 chance of survival, said Carson, a Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon from Baltimore. But he said he expected the surgery to be a success.
The $288,000 cost of the surgery is being underwritten by Raffles Hospital, and the doctors' fees are being waived.
The surgeons' biggest challenge will be dealing with a shared vein that drains blood from the women's brains. German doctors concluded in 1996 that vein made the surgery too dangerous.
The surgeons' first task was to remove a vein from one sister's leg that will be used as a graft to replace the shared vein, Kumar said. He did not say from which sister the vein would be taken.
He compared the veins to a city's road network and said the task surgeons faced was to identify traffic jams and create detours. The largest vein was the size of a finger, he said.
Saturday's tests were aimed at finding alternative blood channels and to see if a bypass was necessary, Nair said. The tests, led by French neuroradiologist Dr. Pierre-Louis Lasjaunias, lasted four hours.
The discovery high pressure in their brains explained why Laleh had suffered chronic headaches and meant medical intervention would have eventually been necessary, Goh told reporters, without elaborating.
The twins will remain seated throughout the operation - a standard practice in brain surgery.
They sisters came to Singapore in November after hearing about Goh's success in separating 18-month-old Nepalese infants who were also joined at the head.
Both sisters studied law because Ladan wanted to be a lawyer. But after the surgery, Laleh wants to move to Tehran to be a journalist, while Ladan wants to move back home with her parents and continue her studies to qualify as a lawyer.

Carter, whose democracy and human rights organisation is monitoring this Thursday's landmark elections in the Himalayan nation, was given assurances by the Maoists that the polls would be peaceful.
""President Carter wanted to know about the election situation and expressed his concern over whether it will be free and fair,"" Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoists' second-in-command, told reporters after the meeting.
""We assured him that the elections will be held in a peaceful manner and we are committed to peaceful polls,"" Bhattarai said after the meeting between himself, Carter and Maoist leader Prachanda.
The run-up to the polls has been marred by violence by all political parties, but particularly the Maoists, the United Nations has said.
The Maoists -- who fought a decade-long guerrilla war aimed at toppling the monarchy -- signed a peace deal in late 2006, but remain on a US list of terrorist organisations.
The polls are a central plank of the peace deal, and will elect a body that is expected to abolish Nepal's monarchy as well as write a new constitution.

"3910",20051472,"Title: Six soldiers, two police, at least one communist rebel killed in fighting in Nepal.rtf; Date: June 13, 2005 Monday; Text: Communist rebels killed at least six soldiers and two policemen who were patrolling near a mountainous village on Monday, the military said.
In an ensuing battle, six rebels were also killed near Ghartichap village, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, the Royal Nepalese Army said in a statement.
The soldiers and policemen were patrolling the area when they came under attack, it said.
Details were sketchy, but the army said it recovered the bodies of the dead rebels and some guns and ammunition from the battle site.
On their Nepali language Web site the rebels confirmed that six the soldiers and two policemen died but said only one of their fighters was killed. There was no independent confirmation of the incident.
Earlier, suspected rebels gunned down a college chief and two policemen who were assigned to guard him in western Nepal, police said Monday.
Ganeshman Palikhe was standing outside his house with his bodyguards on Sunday evening when the rebels, riding on motorcycles, approached the property. After greeting Palikhe, the rebels opened fire, police officials said on the customary condition of anonymity.
Palikhe was the chief of Jana Priya College in Pokhara, a resort town 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu.
He had received several threats from the rebels in the past three months and had been given police protection.
It was not clear why he was targeted and police said they were investigating the killing.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.
The guerrillas have stepped up violence since King Gyanendra took absolute power in February promising to quell the insurgency.
The insurgency has left more than 11,500 people dead since 1996.

"4265",2005875,"Title: As children die of encephalitis, Indian officials promise future vaccinations(2).rtf; Date: September 23, 2005 Friday; Text: A vaccine that costs one U.S. dollar could have saved Nand Kishore Sharma's 7-year-old daughter from a painful death last month. When he's told this, he simply shrugs. He and his neighbors in a remote village in northern India are used to being overlooked in a place crippled by poverty.
The Sharmas are just one family hit by the area's worst Japanese encephalitis outbreak in recent memory. It has killed 850 people, mostly children, here in India's Uttar Pradesh state. Another 271 have died across the border in Nepal, pushing the total over 1,100.
India's government has promised to immunize every child in the worst-affected areas - but it's too late to save any lives this year.
Government hospitals have been overwhelmed by a deluge of sick children who sometimes lie two to a bed, and critics blame the situation on an underfunded medical system - Uttar Pradesh's has a health budget of 1.06 billion rupees (US$24.2 million; [euro]19.8 million) for 180 million people, about 7 U.S. cents ([euro].06) per person - and on what they complain are wasteful projects.
""Saving children's lives is not the government's priority,"" said Dr. T.N. Dhole, head of the microbiology department at the Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute in the state capital, Lucknow. ""Deaths could have been prevented if the government had taken preventive steps and had inoculated the children.""
Every year, Japanese encephalitis breaks out in eastern Uttar Pradesh. It is the region's main rice-growing area, with a bowl-shaped geography that traps water, providing the perfect breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that spread the incurable disease from pigs to humans. This year has been exceptionally rainy, leaving pools of water everywhere.
The state's health minister, Jaiveer Singh, said the government is working to obtain money for vaccines and is prepared to tap a discretionary fund to ensure children are immunized before the next rainy season.
But as images emerge of hundreds of children dying in filthy, understaffed and ill-equipped hospitals, some are asking why. Critics point to millions spent on building parks and statues of Italian marble, noting the state recently gave former U.S. President Bill Clinton a welcome costing 10 million rupees (US$228,000; [euro]186,518). Last week's groundbreaking for a multimillion dollar (euro) runway in the home village of the state's top leader, Mulayam Singh Yadav, fueled more resentment.
""How can you justify the government's decision to spend 500 million rupees (US$11 million; [euro]9 million) in construction of an airstrip in a remote village where no airplane is expected to land while thousands of children are dying without medicine?"" asked Dr. Radha Mohan Agarwal, an opposition lawmaker and a pediatrician in Gorakhpur, where most sick children are sent for treatment.
Singh, the state health minister, defended the money spent on parks, saying they are built for various castes to send voters messages that the government is working for them. A 700-million rupee (US$16 million; [euro]13 million) park was recently constructed in Lucknow.
""It doesn't mean we are not sensitive to what is happening,"" Singh said. ""Our government has ordered free medical help to all Japanese encephalitis children.""
Money isn't the only obstacle. India produces about 400,000 doses annually of a Japanese encephalitis vaccine used in the U.S. and some other countries. It is labor intensive and requires three injections to be effective, costing about 150 rupees (US$3; [euro]2.45) per child.
A one-shot vaccine used routinely in China is three times cheaper, but cannot be licensed in India until undergoing clinical trials to ensure its safety and effectiveness. The World Health Organization says it cannot help because it can only procure approved vaccines. The WHO has not endorsed any Japanese encephalitis vaccine, though officials stress that doesn't mean the vaccines in use are bad or shouldn't be imported.
India's health minister said the central government has asked its Asian embassies to buy as much of the three-dose vaccine as possible. The government is also pushing a domestic laboratory to increase production.
Squabbling between federal and state authorities can also sometimes get in the way of effective action.
Officials from India's ruling Congress Party allege the state government, controlled by the rival Samajwadi Party, has intentionally grounded a helicopter sent last week by federal authorities to spray for mosquitos because of political differences. State officials insist spraying is not feasible because the affected villages are too spread out.
Despite the obstacles, some are optimistic. Mapping of the hardest-hit districts has already begun to determine where the vaccine should be given first, but it's unknown how long the momentum will last.
""The government is seriously planning,"" said Rajshankar Ghosh, Japanese encephalitis senior project manager for the U.S. nonprofit, PATH. ""I'm not able to predic"

 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has appealed to the countrymen to maintain social harmony and tolerance.
 Addressing live over the state-owned Radio and Television stations Wednesday 1 September afternoon, Mr Deuba denounced the killing of 12 Nepalis by a group of Islamic militants in Iraq saying, ""Terrorists don't have any religion or caste.""
 He also appealed to the masses not to target any particular community and engage in provocative activities. He did not explain.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 1 Sep 04
He is believed to be referring towards vandalizing acts at a well-known mosque at Ghantaghar in Kathmandu Wednesday. Police had fired bullets in the air to disperse the crowd that had targeted the mosque.
 Mr Deuba said Nepali people are known for their tolerance and social harmony world over and appealed them to maintain that character.
 The prime minister also conveyed his condolence to the families of victims. He said the abductors had neither set a deadline nor put any conditions. ""The cruel murder that took place at a time when the government was making efforts for their release - through the media, diplomatic means and religious leaders - has raised questions on the human civilization itself,"" he added.
 The premier said the government would provide a compensation of 1m rupees to the families of each victim and observe Thursday as a day of national mourning.
 The prime minister further said the government was trying to recover the bodies of Nepalis killed in Iraq and bring them back. He said the government would also take strong actions against individuals and agencies that are sending Nepali people illegally to Iraq.
 Prime minister's address came after nationwide protests took place from Tuesday evening and unruly mobs targeted manpower companies, foreign airlines, a leading publication house and private and public property in Kathmandu from early Wednesday.
 The government has clamped curfew in parts of Kathmandu metropolis and Lalitpur sub-municipality from 1400 hours local time 0815 gmt to control the situation.

"5191",20066970,"Title: Three Nepali women arrested over rhino poaching.rtf; Date: November 1, 2006 Wednesday 8:52 AM GMT; Text: Three women living on the edge of a national park in Nepal have been arrested and charged with poaching after the killing of three endangered one-horned rhinoceros, an official said Wednesday.
""A team comprising members of the anti-poaching unit of the Chitwan National Park and personnel from the Nepali Army arrested the women in a search operation following the killing of three rhinos over the last two weeks,"" said Aana Nath Baral, a conservation officer at the park.
Local people gave information about the suspected poachers and ""during preliminary investigations, the women admitted that they used electric wires to electrocute and kill the rhinos,"" Baral said in a phone interview.
Rhino horns are prized as an aphrodisiac in China and are used to make dagger handles in Arab countries, Baral said from the park 200 kilometres (125 miles) west of Kathmandu.
""One rhino horn can fetch as much as 14,000 dollars on the international black market,"" he said.
If any of the three women arrested Monday are found guilty of poaching rhino, they face a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison under Nepali law.
According to a census undertaken 18 months ago, there were 372 one-horned Indian rhinos in the 932 square kilometre (360 square mile) park.
""At least 23 rhinos have been killed by poachers since the census and 10 others have died naturally,"" said Baral.
Wild one-horned rhinos inhabit three sanctuaries in Nepal, with the largest population at the Chitwan National Park.
