 Yunus Kabari, the Nepali national among six people taken hostage in Baghdad on Monday 1 November , may be a resident of eastern terai plains district of Siraha, officials said.
 Kabari, which sounds like a Muslim name, was working as a coffee boy at the Baghdad office of Saudi Arabian Trading and Contracting Company in Iraq.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 3 Nov 04Charge d' Affaires at the Royal Nepalese embassy in Saudi Arabia Lok Bahadur Thapa said he visited the head office of the company at Riyadh Monday and requested them to provide more details about their Nepali staff.
 Kabari was abducted at gunpoint by an unknown group of assailants in the Al-Mansur district of Baghdad Monday afternoon. The whereabouts of the group remains unknown as yet. ""We haven't heard anything from the group as yet and we don't know their intentions,"" reports quoted Shyamanand Suman, Royal Nepalese ambassador in Doha, Qatar, as saying.
 Suman had played an active role in trying to establish contact with Al-Ansar al-Sunnah, the Islamic extremist group that abducted 12 innocent Nepalis in August this year and later slaughtered them without making any demands. Nepali authorities were subject to popular anger and criticism for failing to establish contacts with the insurgent group.
 This time around, top Foreign Ministry officials have said they will leave no stone unturned to locate and ensure safe release of the Nepali citizen. Nepal government has appealed to the international community and requested the Indian embassy in Baghdad to help in this matter.
 Nepal doesn't have diplomatic representation in Iraq and has prohibited Nepalis to go and work in the war-ravaged country. But thousands of Nepalis are said to be working within Iraq, mainly as construction workers, security guards and domestic helps, risking their lives.

According to the Global Competitive Report 2011-12 released today by World Economic Forum globally, the country has improved in macroeconomic environment and health, though its needs to have a lots of improvements in institutions and infrastructures - the two key pillars of the index among the 12 pillars based upon which the score is calculated.
""However, Nepal still falls under factor driven country category that needs to focus on first four pillars - institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment and health and primary education,"" said national coordinator of the World Economic Forum survey team in Nepal Ramesh Chandra Chitrakar.
Under the first pillar - institutions - government's attitude towards market also plays key role and under second pillar - infrastructure - market integration to reduce cost to the market is key, which has pulled Nepals overall score.
""The importance of pillar and focus depends on the stage of the country,"" he said, adding that the per capita income and mineral exports decide the category.
There are 37 economies like Nepal that fall under the factor driven category that have their per capita income below $2,000. The economies that have between $3,000 and $8,999 per capita income fall under efficiency driven category which has 28 countries and the economies that have over $17,000 per capita income fall under the innovative driven category that has 35 countries.
Nepal's GDP stands at $15.8 billion with $562 per capita income, according to the report.
The report has identified government instability, inefficient government bureaucracy, policy instability, corruption and indequate supply of infrastructure as five most problemetic factors for doing business, which was similar to last years report.
The Global Competitiveness Report's competitiveness ranking is based on the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), developed for the World Economic Forum by Sala-i-Martin and introduced in 2004.
The GCI comprises 12 pillars - institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labour market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication and innovation - of competitiveness that together provide a comprehensive picture of a country's competitiveness landscape.
The rankings are calculated from both publicly available data and the Executive Opinion Survey - a comprehensive annual survey conducted by the World Economic Forum with its network of Partner Institutes. ""In Nepal, (Centre for Economic Development and Administration (CEDA) is the partner that has been releasing the report since 2006.
This year, over 14,000 business leaders were polled in a record 142 economies. In Nepal some 103 small (with less than 20 employees), medium (between 20 and 50 employees) and large (with over 50 employees) industries were polled for the survey that is designed to capture a broad range of factors affecting an economy's business climate.
As usual Switzerland still leads the world in competitiveness because of innovation and labour market efficiency, whereas Singapore came second and Sweden third.
The United States ranked fifth, falling for the third year in a row.
The United States has good universities, is strong in research and development and has a big economy and a flexible workforce, the report said, adding that the business community, however, continues to be critical toward public and private institutions.

The aircraft of state-owned Alliance Air was carrying 127 passengers from central India to New Delhi when the pilot flashed a hijack alert to air traffic control in the Indian capital.
Commandos surrounded the aircraft but then were told it was only an exercise, the second false alarm in as many months.
""We carried out the drill to check the alertness of security forces,"" Civil Aviation Secretary K. Roy Pal was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency.
On August 20, troops surrounded a plane at New Delhi's airport that was about to leave for troubled Indian-administered Kashmir after the pilot falsely alerted that the flight was being hijacked.
The 57 passengers and seven crew members were taken off the plane of state domestic carrier Indian Airlines but after the initial panic, authorities realised there was no security threat.
Indian airports have been heavily guarded since an Indian Airlines plane bound for New Delhi was hijacked in 1999 from Nepal's capital Kathmandu and taken to Afghanistan, then under the rule of the hardline Taliban regime.
The passengers of the plane bound for New Delhi were released after India agreed to release three prominent Islamic militants from its jails.

Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and 22 other ministers underwent medical tests on Friday before being declared fit to travel by helicopter to the Kalapattar plateau, 5,262 metres (17,192 feet) up in the Himalayas.
There, they will take part in a traditional Sherpa prayer ceremony before approving the speech to be delivered by the prime minister at next week's UN climate change summit in Copenhagen.
Scientists say the Himalayan glaciers are melting at an alarming rate and creating huge glacial lakes that threaten to burst, devastating mountain communities downstream.
They warn that the glaciers could disappear within decades, bringing drought to large swathes of Asia, where 1.3 billion people depend on rivers that originate in the Himalayas.
Organisers of the trip said weather conditions were favourable for the event, which comes after ministers in the Maldives held an underwater meeting in October to highlight the dangers of rising sea levels.
""We have clear blue skies and low wind this morning so we will start early,"" Suman Pandey told AFP.
""The ministers will remain at the meeting place for around 20 minutes before returning.""
Helicopters have already ferried in a team of doctors and medical equipment to the remote Kalapattar plateau and each minister has been given an oxygen cylinder and face mask in case they get into difficulties.

In a verdict to writ petitions filed by former ministers and administrators who served under the monarch's direct rule from Feb. 1, 2005, to April 24, 2006, the top court nullified the election law saying it contravenes the country's interim constitution.
Last year, the government formed a high-powered commission to look into excesses and rights abuses under the royal regime and recommended punishment of those who suppressed the bloody popular uprising against the king in April 2006.
Following its inquiry, the panel implicated 202 individuals, including the king.
In June this year, the interim parliament enacted the law prohibiting royalists found guilty by the investigation panel from contesting the assembly election.
Kamal Thapa, one of the petitioners and a former minister who served under the royal regime, hailed the ruling as ""democratic.""
""Given a free and fair election, the royalists would win a majority of seats in the 497-member assembly in the upcoming election,"" said Thapa, former president of a pro-royalist political party.
The assembly will rewrite Nepal's constitution and will decide whether to keep Nepal's 239-year-old monarchy.
The holding of the election, however, remains uncertain following a walkout by Maoist rebels from the government.
The Maoists are demanding that Nepal abolish the monarchy before holding the election.

""All 48 students and two teachers have been freed and arrived home safely,"" said Budhisagar Sapkota, director of Dhurba High School in Lekhnath, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu.
Sapkota said none of the students were harmed or mistreated while they were with the Maoist rebels but were forced to attend a gathering by the guerrillas.
They were freed on Saturday along with 25 students from neighboring Sitaram High School, who were also taken on the same day.
The students were taken on Tuesday from two schools in the village near the resort town of Pokhara, a popular starting point for tourist treks in the Himalayas.
The rebels - who are fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state - are known to hold students for several days to try indoctrinating them with Maoist ideology.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, have continued abducting students and villagers despite their promise not to go after civilians during a unilateral cease-fire they declared in September.
Rebel violence in Nepal has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government in February. He said the measure was necessary to quell the communist insurgency, which has killed about 12,000 people since 1996.

Police were posted on most streets as organisers said they were expecting up to 300,000 people to join the rally at the Open Theatre in the city.
They are protesting the king's sacking of the elected prime minister on October 4. Gyanendra took power for a week before appointing a royalist interim government and also indefinitely postponed a general election.
The political parties say that the current government does not have a mandate to negotiate with Maoist rebels.
Talks between the government and the rebels opened Sunday after a ceasefire was announced in January following seven years of insurgency that have cost 7,800 lives.
The rally is being organised jointly by the Nepali Congress (NC), the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninists (NCP-UML), the Nepal Peasants and Workers' Party (NPWP), People's Front-Nepal (PF-N) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NGP).

 The common platform could be forged on a minimum understanding of the rebels' program of abolishing the monarchy in Nepal, Baburam Bhattarai said in his article in the Nepal Samacharpatra.
 The need for a common platform for a 'progressive political solution' -- the Maoist euphemism for ending the antimonarchist insurgency -- is felt today more than ever, Bhattarai said.
The senior member of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) said recent talks between rebel leaders and the general secretary of the Nepal Communist Party (Unified Marxist-Leninist, NCP-UML) in Lucknow, India, were aimed at such understanding.
 Bhattarai, the party's No. 2 man after Puspakamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, and the party's principal ideologue, said understanding of, and cooperation with, the centrist Nepali Congress Party (NCP) is becoming increasingly crucial.
 The NCP is Nepal's largest political party, while the NCP-UML is the mainline left outfit. The two parties held the largest and second largest number of seats, respectively, in Nepal's dissolved parliament.
 Both are presently fighting what they term the regressive step of King Gyanaendra, who dismissed the elected government and seized executive powers in October 2002.
 On the rebels' demand for a common front, both parties hold the position that they would be more than willing to join forces if the rebels lay down their arms and eschew violence.
 The NCP and NCP-UML together drafted Nepal's Constitution of 1990, which provides for constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
 The Maoists, however, reject the Constitution, saying it does not adequately curtail the king's powers.
 The rebels are demanding elections to a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution that will decide the future of the monarchy in Nepal.
 The rebels pressed their demand for the assembly during the peace talks that failed last August.

They were the first to reach the 8,850-meter summit from the Nepalese side during this year's climbing season, which ends Tuesday, said Rajendra Pandey, a Mountaineering Department official.
At least two climbers have died in previous attempts this year, as strong winds and snowstorms have made climbing conditions miserable, forcing climbers to remain at the base camp for weeks.
According to the latest reports from the mountain, the climbers were moving safely along the route, but wind was picking up speed and cloud cover was moving over the peak as the climbers make their return journey.
The return is considered more dangerous, because climbers tend to be exhausted and have less oxygen to spare.
Dozens of climbers left the highest South Col camp at 26,240 feet around midnight and trekked in the dark across the icy slopes toward the summit. The section above South Col is known as the ""death zone"" for its extreme weather and thin atmosphere.
Mountaineering officials in Katmandu said the weather forecast was favorable, with low winds and clear skies - the first calm weather on the south side of the mountain this climbing season.
Some climbers have scaled Mount Everest from the Chinese side in recent days.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, more than 1,400 climbers have scaled the mountain. About 180 people have died on its unpredictable slopes.

 The Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) said in a statement that the policy change was agreed during a recent politburo meeting.
 The promise came a day after a government army soldier was killed and eight injured when their truck drove over a land mine that Maoist rebels are suspected of setting, while government troops killed 24 rebels in weekend clashes across the kingdom.
The statement, signed by Maoist leader Prachanda and distributed to the local Nepalese media Tuesday evening, said Maoist militia will refrain from attacking workers of rival political parties, junior police and army officers on leave as well as their family members.
 The Maoists said they will stop sabotaging bridges, airports, telecom towers, and sites of natural heritage.
 Nepalese and international non-government organizations (NGOs), except those directly run by the 'American imperialists,' would be spared from attacks by the Maoist militia, the party said. Instead, the rebels would try to work with the NGOs in the rural areas where they claim to have complete control.
 Following the collapse of peace talks in late August, the Maoist rebels have bombed a score of police outposts, training centers, and infrastructures such as roads and bridges.
 Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa said Monday the government would wage an all-out war against the rebels.
 No leniency would be shown to the rebels if they continued with their acts of rampage, he told a public meeting in the Parsa district of southwestern Nepal.
 The Maoists have been fighting the Nepalese government since 1996 in a bid to topple the monarchy and set up a republic.

""He would call the girls alone to his office, lock the door, hold the hands and kiss them, and get us to touch his feet in reverence,"" the students accused. ""He would ask us personal questions like if we were having periods before touching us and also ask us to think of him while sleeping and in the bathroom,"" they added.
One girl claimed she was repeatedly harassed by chairman Jagdish ever since she got admitted to the college -affiliated to the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) and Higher Secondary Education Board - on September 9, 2009 until she finally had enough and transferred to another college last year. ""He had even visited my aunt and offered to keep me at his home,"" the girl who hails from Lukla, Solukhumbu, said.
The girls claimed they had even been filmed changing clothes during college functions through a closed-circuit television (CCTV). The girls further claimed that chairman's son Pawan also used to harass them. One of the girls even forwarded a derogatory message reportedly sent by the chairman's son Pawan, a teacher at the college, to this scribe.
Pawan, who is an unmarried youth, denied sending any derogatory text messages and challenged to check the record of CCTV footages to see if the girls were filmed changing clothes. ""I am a young guy and am friendly with them despite being a teacher, but I have not sent the message to that girl,"" Pawan said.
""He called me up and chided me for showing the text message to others,"" the girl accused Pawan of reproached her after this scribe asked the latter about the text message sent to her with explicit content. The girls also charged chairman Jagdish's wife Mira, also the member secretary of the college board, of accusing them of having illicit relationship with her husband and son when they complained about the harassment at a meeting Tuesday morning.
Asked why did they not come forward with the allegation before, the girls - who were with the cadres of Maoist affiliated All Nepal National Independent Students' Union-Revolutionary - pointed to the threats made by the Vaidyas and their inherent shyness about the awkward issue. ""We have come forward now only due to support from ANNISU-R,"" they stated.
The Vaidyas claimed the accusations were fabricated and instigated by ANNISU-R. ""They had put forward a 14-point memorandum demanding reduction of fees and improvement in quality of education,"" Jagdish said adding, ""We had a meeting with them about addressing the demands today but they suddenly turned violent and vandalized college premises. They have come up with these fabricated allegations after finding themselves on the back foot for having resorted to violence.""
""I have not done anything wrong. Can anyone do such things to one's students and children,"" Jagdish said when told of the allegations. ""I am ready to face any punishment if the allegations are proven to be true,"" he said. He argued that the girl, who had changed the college last year, had done so due to cheaper fee structure of the other college. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

The government Thursday [17 August] tabled a bill at the House of Representatives (HoR) to amend the Army Act 2016, which will formally sever the traditional link between the Nepali Army and the king and bring the army under the total control of democratic government.

Tanahu [west Nepal], 24 November: Vice-President of the Nepali Congress Sushil Koirala has said even the international community has taken positively the agreement between the seven political parties and the Maoists.
In a people's awareness programme organized by the Nepali Congress, Tanahu, Thursday [24 November] in Damauli, Vice-President Koirala clarified that the seven parties and the Maoists reached an agreement to end autocratic monarchy and find a solution to the national crisis, adding that the international community is viewing the agreement for peace and total democracy positively.
Referring to comments made by the government on the agreement, he said: ""Even if the seven parties are declared anti-national elements, we will not step back. Let the government make such a declaration if it can; we will not cower.""
Stating that the Maoists are about to lay down their arms and join multiparty competition, he advised the government to take the right decision in such a situation.
He informed that the possibility of re-unification of Nepali Congress and the Nepali Congress (Democratic) is increasing. Answering a question of journalists, Koirala revealed that the agreement between the seven parties and the Maoists was reached in Delhi due to a lack of a conducive environment for it in Nepal.
He, however, ruled out cooperation with the Maoists until they lay down their weapons.

"6984",20081173,"Title: Tibet capital locked down after riots kill 10; sympathy protests spring up elsewhere.rtf; Date: March 15, 2008 Saturday 6:07 PM GMT; Text: China locked down the Tibetan capital Saturday after the largest and most violent protests against its rule in the region in nearly two decades. At least 10 people were killed when demonstrators rampaged through Lhasa, dashing Beijing's plans for a smooth run-up to the Olympics in August.
The same day police broke up sympathy protests in China's western province of Gansu, as well as in Australia, India, Nepal and Switzerland.
Lhasa's streets were mostly empty as a curfew remained in place. Eyewitnesses described baton-wielding police patrolling as fires from Friday's violence smoldered. Reports of deaths and arrests were varied and could not be independently confirmed.
A foreigner in Lhasa, who asked not to be identified, said shooting continued into Saturday night.
The exiled Tibetan government in India, which is led by the Dalai Lama, said it confimed that Chinese authorities killed 30 Tibetans and had unconfirmed reports of 100 deaths. It offered no further details.
China's official Xinhua News Agency said 10 people including two hotel employees and two shop owners were burned to death, but no foreigners were hurt. It gave no other details. Twelve members of the police and armed police forces were also injured, Xinhua reported later.
The unrest came two weeks before China's highly anticipated Olympic celebrations go into high gear with the start of the torch relay, which passes through Tibet.
Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Beijing Olympics organizing committee, said the unrest would not have a negative effect on the Games or relay.
Preparations to carry the Olympic torch across Mount Everest and Tibet ""have been proceeding very smoothly and according to schedule,"" Sun said.
""The hosting of the Beijing Games is the 100-year dream for Chinese people and I think the Chinese people, including our compatriots in Tibet, very much look forward to hosting the Games,"" Sun said.
The U.S. and other governments have urged China to show restraint on the protesters. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge deferred, saying he did not have details.
""It is not our job,"" Rogge told reporters while visiting Puerto Rico. ""We are not an activist organization.""
China's governor in Tibet vowed to punish the rioters, while law enforcement authorities urged protesters to turn themselves in by Tuesday or face unspecified punishment.
""We will deal harshly with these criminals in accordance with the law,"" Champa Phuntsok, chairman of the Tibetan government, told reporters in Beijing where he was attending a legislative meeting. ""Beating, smashing, looting and burning we absolutely condemn this sort of behavior. This plot is doomed to failure.""
He blamed the protests on followers of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule and is still Tibet's widely revered spiritual leader.
From Dharamsala, India, the Dalai Lama appealed to China not to use force. He said he was ""deeply concerned"" and urged Tibetans ""not to resort to violence.""
Over the centuries, Tibet was at times part of China's dynastic empires. Communist forces invaded the region in 1950 to reclaim the Himalayan region and seize the commanding heights overlooking rival India.
The latest unrest began Monday, the anniversary of the 1959 uprising, when 300 monks from one monastery demanded the release of other monks detained last fall. But political demands soon came to the fore.
The violence erupted on the fifth day, after police tried to stop monks from protesting in central Lhasa. Ordinary Tibetans vented pent-up anger on Chinese, hurling stones and torching shops and cars.
""The protesters yesterday went from attacking Chinese police to attacking innocent people very, very quickly,"" said a blog entry by a group of Westerners staying in a hotel in central Lhasa near the riot. ""Many Tibetans were also caught in the crossfire.""
Xinhua said Saturday that Lhasa had ""reverted to calm,"" and that electricity and phone service, cut for parts of Friday, were being restored.
The foreigner in Lhasa said Chinese troops armed with automatic rifles had set up positions in the Barkhor area in the capital's old city after clearing it of people and were firing at anything that moved. There was no independent confirmation that anyone had been injured or killed by the forces.
A notice issued by Tibet's high court, prosecutors office and police department offered leniency for demonstrators who surrender before Tuesday. Otherwise they will be ""severely punished,"" according to a notice carried on official Web sites and confirmed by prosecutors.
Some shops in Lhasa were closed. Tourists were told to stay in their hotels and make plans to leave, but government staff were required to work.
""There's no conflict today. The streets look pretty quiet,"" said a woman who answered the telephone at the Lhasa Hotel.
Tourists reached by phone described soldiers standing in lines, sealing off streets where the rioting occurr"

The prince, grandson of King Gyanendra and an heir to the throne, will be fed soft rice by his mother, Princess Himani, and father, Crown Prince Paras, at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace in Katmandu.
Hindu tradition in Nepal requires that babies be fed rice in a ceremony days before they reach their sixth month.
Following the ceremony, Prince Hridayendra, whose name means ""king of hearts,"" will be taken around the city in a horse-drawn carriage on his first trip outside the royal palace.
Gyanendra assumed the throne after his brother and eight members of the royal family were killed. A government inquiry blamed then-Crown Prince Dipendra, who shot himself and later died in hospital.
The royal family massacre on June 1, 2000 shook the Himalayan kingdom, and set off violent protests across the country because people refused to accept that their popular king had been gunned down by his son.

In coordinated protests in each of the Himalayan country's 75 districts, Nepali Congress activists handed over memoranda to local officials insisting Gyanendra withdraw his October proclamation ousting the elected prime minister.
About 1,000 people marched in the capital Kathmandu, with smaller numbers reported in district headquarters across the kingdom. No violence was reported, home ministry officials said.
The protest letter urged Gyanendra, who is officially a constitutional monarch, to reinstate the parliament and ""vest the sovereign and executive rights in the people as per the constitution,"" Nepali Congress central secretary Sobhakar Parajuli told AFP.
Gyanendra on October 4 sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent,"" and took power for a week before appointing staunch monarchist Lokendra Bahadur Chand as interim premier.
Chand will remain in office until new elections are held, but no poll dates have been announced. Gyanendra suspended a parliamentary vote Deuba had called for November 2002.
The protests Monday were led by the Nepali Congress faction headed by former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
Deuba, in a bitter rivalry with Koirala, was ousted from the Nepali Congress after he called the election last year. He has since formed a separate party.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) made its appeal in letters to both sides.
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire last month to pave way for negotiations to end seven years of violence.
The NHRC asked the rebels to stop using booby traps to ambush army and police vehicles and cease violence, arson, ""collection"" of funds and abduction.

Buses carrying passengers to other parts of the Himalayan kingdom and trucks hauling fresh produce began leaving the city unaccompanied by the military escorts that had guarded them during the seven-day blockade.
The shutdown had been enforced through threats and prices had shot up as truckers demanded more money to defy the Maoist rebels, who control much of rural Nepal and are fighting to overthrow the monarchy.
Min Bahadur Tamang had been waiting for the blockade to end so he could take his 14-year-old daughter to Kathmandu for treatment of typhoid.
He rushed his daughter into a taxi as soon as he arrived early Wednesday at the Gongbu Bus Terminal in the capital.
""I was stranded in my village in Dhading,"" some 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the west, said Tamang, 46.
""I'm very relieved now. I had been worrying for the past several days as my daughter could not get the proper treatment,"" he said.
The Gongbu terminal returned to its busy look Wednesday with at least 69 buses going out of the station in the morning, compared with 23 buses a day from all of Kathmandu during the blockade, said Arun Thakuri, a terminal manager.
""Our buses would go out of Kathmandu taking a big risk of being attacked by the strikers"" during the blockade, Thakuri said.
Usually, 600 buses enter or leave Kathmandu each day, 250 of them from the Gongbu terminal, he said.
Relief was also felt on the fruit and vegetable markets, which remained well-stocked throughout the blockade but saw costs surge.
Vendors said prices were beginning to go down marginally, although it would take a few days for a full return to normal as supply routes were restored.
""We can now heave a sigh of relief,"" said vegetable and fruit dealer Rajan Bharati, 35, as his assistants sold bags of tomatoes, radishes, cucumbers and onions.
He said merchants had to pay up to 10 times as much to truckers who defied the blockade to bring fresh produce into Kathmandu -- prices that were passed on to customers.
""We will make up for the losses,"" he said. ""However, it is the common people who have to suffer as they have to buy things at a high price.""
Most of his produce was shipped in from outside Kathmandu, either other parts of the kingdom or India.
He said a vendor can make around 1,200 rupees (16 dollars) on a good business day, but he had to pay rent of 3,700 rupees (50 dollars) a month for his space at the market.
The Maoists have warned they are only suspending the blockade for a month unless the government concedes to their demands.
The rebels want immediate talks on their terms to end the war which has claimed some 10,000 lives since 1996.
The blockade was seen as symbolic pressure on the government and the people of Kathmandu, where there is little overt support for the mostly rural rebels.

"1188",20032452,"Title: Nepal extends curfews amid new violence after Maoists end truce.rtf; Date: August 31, 2003 Sunday; Text: Nepal's government extended curfews and deployed armed guards for political leaders as Maoist rebels and soldiers fought two deadly clashes, days after the peace process collapsed, officials said Sunday.
Rebels ambushed an army patrol Sunday at Melarani village in Surkhet district, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, triggering a daylong gunbattle, an army official said.
""Our preliminary reports are that seven Maoists and three soldiers were killed,"" the official said.
He said a similar clash Saturday in the southeastern Udaipur district left two Maoists dead and three soldiers wounded.
Fourteen of Nepal's 75 districts are now under dawn-to-dusk curfew after nine more districts were added Saturday, amid fears the isolated Maoist attacks could give way to nationwide fighting.
""The number of districts coming under curfew is increasing every day and a curfew could even be imposed in the Kathmandu Valley if the Maoists resume their subversive activities,"" home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said.
The Maoists on Wednesday walked out of a seven-month ceasefire and peace talks after the government refused to agree to an assembly to redraft the constitution.
Since their withdrawal from the truce, the rebels have been blamed for a series of assassination bids against prominent political figures, both from the current government and previous ones.
In response, the government has authorised police protection for leading politicians, a member of Nepal's cabinet said.
Armed guards were seen Sunday guarding the Kathmandu offices of Nepal's two largest mainstream political parties, the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist.
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa met at the weekend with top leaders of his National Democratic Party to figure out the government's next move, with some aides urging him to call for a nationwide emergency that would allow security forces more leeway to preempt attacks.
The government has already renewed its classification of the Maoists as a terrorist group, which means rebel leaders could be arrested on sight.
The Maoists were taken off the terrorist list as a goodwill gesture when the ceasefire was reached in January.
Among the assassination bids blamed on the Maoists, an army colonel who was based at the royal palace was shot dead Thursday. One day later, former state minister for home affairs Devendra Raj Kandel was shot five times. Kandel's condition is improving, doctors said.
Last week gunmen ambushed the motorcade of former premier Sher Bahadur Deuba, who had led a crackdown on the rebels in late 2001 and 2002 after an earlier truce collapsed, but he was unhurt.
The Maoist leadership expressed ""sorrow"" over the incident in western Nepal, saying ""spies and security forces,"" not Deuba, were the target.
Suspected rebels also set fire to the ancestral home of Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, who led the government team in three rounds of peace talks, the last of which broke down August 19.
The Maoists launched a ""people's war"" in 1996 aimed at overthrowing the constitutional monarchy. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.

  NATURE HAS served a double blow to Uttar Pradesh - flood here and drought there.
  Due to scanty rainfall in August the spectre of drought looms large over two-dozen districts, while half a dozen districts are already reeling under flood.
  The sudden spate in the Sharda, the Ghaghra and the Rapti breached embankments and flooded around 300 villages in six districts including Lakhimpur Kheri, Barabanki, Balrampur, Gonda, Shravasti and Bahraich.
  ""We were planning to launch relief measures in the districts that have recorded scanty rainfall. But heavy rainfall in the foothills of the Himalayas in the last week of August suddenly led to increase in the water level in the rivers flowing from Nepal across Uttar Pradesh,"" a revenue Department officer said.
  The rivers crossed the danger mark and breached the embankments even before the Irrigation Department engineers could repair it.
  According to Revenue Department record, flood has affected 11,018 people in Lakhimpur Kheri district, 22,000 people in Barabanki district, 1,162,24 people in Balrampur district, 76,250 people in Gonda district, 95,491 people in Shravasti district and 11,857 people in Bahraich district.
  State Relief Commissioner Renuka Kumar told Hindustan Times that along with distributing edible items in the flood hit villages the Army and PAC jawans had been deputed in Barabanki district to shift people from submerged villages to relief camps.
  Health and Animal Husbandry Department had been directed to launch immunization programme in the flood-hit villages, Kumar said and added that chlorine tablets were being distributed in the villages to protect the people from water-borne disease.
  Meanwhile, around 20 per cent kharif crops have been destroyed due to scanty rainfall in districts located in Bundelkhand region and West Uttar Pradesh. The worst-affected districts are Lalitpur, Bareilly, Jhansi, Firozabad, Moradabad,Hameerpu, Fatehpur Meeurt and Saharanpur.
  The districts in which crops have been partially damaged include - Etawah, Ambedkarnagar,, Maharajganj, Aligarh, Baghpat, Bijnor, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Azamgarh, Chandauli, Hathras, Sonebhadra, Hardoi, Deoria, Badaun, Meerut, Pratapgarh, Sant Ravidas Nagar, Mainpuri, Pilibhit, Mau and Kushinagar districts.
  ""Rainfall in last week of August have brought relief to the farmers and we hope to save the eighty per cent of the crop. The farmers have been directed to plant drought resistant crop in the districts that have recorded deficient rainfall"", Renuka Kumar said.
  ""Still a district is declared drought hit only after fifty percent of the crop is destroyed and none of the districts fits in this criterion as crop loss was mere twenty per cent, Kumar said.

Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Baburam Bhattarai, second-in-command of the rebel group, met in the capital Katmandu to show their desire to hold negotiations.
""We are serious about resolving the conflict through peace talks and that is why we are here,"" Bhattarai said. ""We are not going to run away from the talks.""
Bhattarai came out of hiding last week for the talks. It was his first public appearance since the rebels began fighting in 1996 to end the Himalayan kingdom's constitutional monarchy. He was accompanied by four senior rebel leaders.
""The country has emerged out of a dark tunnel and is seeing the light. Though the talks have been delayed there will be talks and there will be peace,"" Chand said.
The government said last week talks would begin Tuesday, but the rebels claimed their supporters still were being harassed and postponed the meeting. No new date has been set, though both sides say they want the talks to be held immediately.
The rebels also have called for the release of rebel supporters in custody.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They are demanding an interim government and an election of a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.
The rebels decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.

Excerpt from report headlined ""Nepal Maoist chief faces wrath of his subordinate commanders"" published by Nepalese weekly Dristi on 13 May
The Maoist top most leaders have faced the wrath of party workers after the election of the constituent assembly. They have been surrounded by party workers. The People's Liberation Army [PLA], which catapulted the Maoist party to this height after their brave fighting and are currently living a hard life in the camps, have exerted great pressure on the top leaders. As the party is engaged in a bid to lead the next government, commanders of the PLA have pressed the leaders not to make Girija Prasad Koirala the president of the country. They have told party chief Prachanda, ""Girija Prasad Koirala as president is unacceptable to us.""
Following the warning of the commanders, Maoist leaders have changed the earlier stand and have been saying that Koirala should not be made the president. On Sunday, Maoist Chief Prachanda and Madheshi People's Rights Forum Coordinator Upendra Yadav agreed not to make Koirala the president. But Indian ambassador to Nepal Rakesh Sood has repeatedly met top political leaders including Prachanda and urged them to make Koirala ceremonial president. The pressure of the Maoist combatants has put the Maoist leaders in difficulty. Before the election of the constituent assembly, the Maoist party had projected Prachanda as the first president and trained its workers and the fighters accordingly. [passage omitted]

In his reply, Maoist Chief Prachanda said that he had to speak in soft tone in public because of national and international compulsions. He said, ""There might be instances of weakness.

"6040",20071582,"Title: China's grandiose plans for torch relay engulfed in conflict with Taiwan.rtf; Date: April 27, 2007 Friday 2:55 AM GMT; Text: China's grandiose plans for the torch relay, the high-profile prelude to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, have been engulfed in conflict by an old political rival Taiwan.
Within hours of Beijing's announcement Thursday of what would be the longest torch relay in Olympic history an 85,000-mile, 130-day route that would cross five continents and scale Mount Everest Taiwan rejected its inclusion.
""It is something that the government and people cannot accept,"" Tsai Chen-wei, the head of Taiwan's Olympic Committee, said in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.
The episode underscores the deep mistrust between Beijing and Taipei, antagonists in an unresolved civil war, and how entwined the Olympics become with politics.
The torch also is supposed to pass through another political hotspot, the Himalayan region of Tibet that China has controlled for 57 years, often with heavy handed rule. Four American activists were detained by Chinese authorities Wednesday on Mount Everest after they unfurled a banner calling for Tibet's independence.
""It is unacceptable that the IOC has allowed China to cynically exploit Olympic imagery of universalism and peace to press its claims over Tibet,"" said Matt Whitticase of Free Tibet Campaign, a member of the International Tibet Support Network.
""This decision is merely the latest example of the IOC's determination to give respectability to China's repression in Tibet.""
Although the IOC has regulations on the torch route, it is the local organizers who decide where the flame goes.
The controversies dimmed the gloss on Beijing's long-awaited announcement of the torch route.
At a nationally televised ceremony attended by senior members of China's ruling Communist Party and the International Olympic Committee, organizers unveiled the torch and showed a video of the proposed route.
""It will be a relay that will cover the longest distance and be most inclusive and involve the most people in Olympic history,"" said Liu Qi, the head of Beijing's Olympic organizing committee.
The relay, which is supposed to embody the Olympic values of friendship through sports, is a popular public relations tool and the only contact most people have with the Olympics.
As with all Olympics, next year's relay will begin in Greece on March 25. After circling Greece, it arrives in Beijing on March 31.
Following that, it will wind across Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa and then back to Asia and China before the torch ignites the cauldron at the opening ceremony on Aug. 8, 2008, in Beijing's 91,000-seat National Stadium.
In addition to about 100 stops in China, other stages announced Thursday include London; Paris; San Francisco; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; Islamabad, Pakistan; and Pyongyang, the capital of politically isolated and belligerent North Korea.
""The Beijing 2008 torch relay will, as its theme says, be a journey of harmony, bringing friendship and respect to people of different nationalities, races and creeds,"" IOC president Jacques Rogge said at the ceremony.
Nevertheless, both Beijing and Taiwan hoped to use the torch relay to bolster political agendas: for Beijing, that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, and for Taiwan that it is independent.
To that end, Taiwan wanted to participate as part of the international route with the torch entering and departing the island via nations other than China. China would like the island run to be part of the domestic route.
In an attempt at compromise, Beijing Olympic organizers said the torch would pass from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei, and then to Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are Chinese-controlled.
""I sincerely hope that Taiwan compatriots can enjoy the glories and joy of the torch relay,"" said Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic organizing committee.
Jiang repeatedly referred to Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as ""overseas Chinese cities,"" a characterization sure to upset Taiwan. Jiang also said Beijing organizers had received a written pledge from Taiwan to participate.
""We received a signed letter in March from the head of the Taipei Olympic Committee,"" Jiang said, adding that Taiwan had agreed to the torch entering from Vietman and leaving for Hong Kong.
But Taiwan's Tsai disputed this.
""This route is a domestic route that constitutes an attempt to downgrade our sovereignty,"" Tsai said.
Tsai's comments contradicted an April 13 statement by another Taiwanese Olympic official, who said the island could accept a spot on the torch route that involved Hong Kong.
Jiang, in a concession to Taiwan, said negotiations would continue.
""We will have further conversations and discussions,"" he said.
IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies declined comment for the time being because of the political nature of the controversy.
The relay's signature moment is expected to be its ascent to the summit of Mount Everest, which straddles Nepal and Chinese-ruled Tibet.
The IOC, which shies away from controversy"
"6478",2008714,"Title: India 's Gorkhas throw weight behind 'Robin Hood' for new state.rtf; Date: August 11, 2008 Monday 4:52 AM GMT; Text: After two decades of an armed struggle for a separate state, a million-plus ethnic Nepalese Gorkhas in India's northeast are hoping their new plain-speaking leader will deliver them the homeland they have long yearned for.
In the hilly tea-growing region of Darjeeling -- where the Gorkhas constitute the majority -- the demand for a new state within India dates back to almost a century, when the country was under British colonial rule.
This time, however, it is hard to find anyone -- even among non-Gorkhas who have lived in this scenic region for decades -- who does not back and believe in the possibility of a ""Gorkhaland"".
One of the reasons for this new, quiet optimism is the emergence of a political leader who has been dubbed a local ""Robin Hood"" by many for raising money to help poor people learn new skills and get jobs.
""People say all that because they have seen my work. I have risen to this position from the bottom,"" Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung said, sitting in his tiny Darjeeling office full of posters and table-top statues of Hindu gods.
Gurung, 44, split last year from the Gorkha party that had led the earlier movement for a homeland to form his own political outfit.
Though the eastern West Bengal state in which Darjeeling is located has firmly rejected the Gorkha demand, Gurung says he will have a new state.
""I am confident that we will get Gorkhaland by 2010. Most leaders come forward for votes but I am not interested in being a minister,"" Gurung said.
""I am just a conduit for people's aspirations. The Gorkhaland is meant for today's generation.""
Gorkhas -- most of whom were brought to the Darjeeling hills by the British when they started tea plantations in the region in the 1840s -- say they deserve a homeland because of their ethnicity, different language and culture.
The question of identity is an emotional subject in the region, where violent protests broke out last year after a Gorkha man was mocked by a radio station after he won the popular ""Indian Idol"" singing contest on television.
Gurung was quick to capitalise on the new wave of pride since he had won a major share of credit for singer's victory by raising money to encourage people to send phone messages to vote for him.
The singer, Prashant Tamang, has since become a Darjeeling hero, with his posters plastered everywhere and autographed pictures prominently displayed in hotel lobbies.
""He is my kid. Being a father, I had to take him under my wing, but I don't want him to join politics,"" Gurung said. ""He is a good singer and I want him to sing.""
It is this ability to connect with people that has made Gorkhas throw their weight behind Gurung.
""He is sincere. He does not seem to be interested in wealth or power, that's why people think he can get them Gorkhaland,"" said a local hotel owner.
The Gorkhas, considered fierce warriors who have fought for the British and Indian armies, also blame the West Bengal government for unemployment and neglect of roads.
Around 55,000 Gorkhas are employed in the tea gardens which produce the famous Darjeeling brew, but the plantations are owned mainly by merchants from northern India and a few by Bengali people.
""Many Indians think we are migrants from Nepal, even though we have been living here for several generations. If we have our own state, this won't happen,"" said a local photographer.
While Gurung enjoys nearly undivided support of the Gorkhas, he also has detractors.
Last month, a strike called by Gurung's party hit the tea and tourism industries -- the mainstay of the local economy.
""Workers could not pluck the leaves properly because of the strike. Work was not badly disrupted, but fear had spread with people hoarding oil and other essentials,"" said Rajiv Lochan, secretary of Siliguri Tea Traders Association.
""He is just a fluke. He has no concrete plans,"" said a tea exporter, who preferred not to give his name. ""All that is needed is a strong development programme for the region and not a new state.""

Speaking at a symposium on ""Seeking Free and Responsible Media"" Organized by Center for South Asian Studies in cooperation with the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in the capital, they noted that the incidents of media rights violations were on the rise in recent years due to impunity persisting in the country.
Presenting a paper on Changing Face of Danger for Nepalese Journalists, journalist Sanjaya Dhakal said various armed outfits operating in eastern hills and Tarai districts have made life difficult for journalists.
The Federation of Nepali Journalists said one journalist was killed and 20 were physically assaulted in 2010. Likewise, 42 journalists were received threats from various gangs and criminal groups while 33 others manhandled during the year.
""As the situation continues to exist, there is still need for Nepali media to wage struggle for their professional and physical safety as well as to establish freedom of press and of expression in Nepal,"" said journalist Chandra Shekhar Adhikari in his paper.
Journalists Anil Giri and Kosh Raj Koirala noted that despite regulations and statutory guarantee of press freedom, Nepali press has yet to feel secure due to failure of the government to take action against those involved in media rights violations.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 29 November
Kathmandu, 29 November: The leaders of the seven-party alliance said that the 12-point ""understanding"" reached with the Maoists on 22 November was a ""preliminary one"" and much homework was needed to clarify on some issues stated in it. Addressing a function here on Monday [28 November], Nepali Congress (NC) Central Working Committee member, Arjun Narsingh KC, said the parties-Maoists understanding was a preliminary one and there were some ""loopholes"" that required clarification. 
He said that the understanding was reached to go to a constituent assembly election through the revival of the dissolved House of Representatives. ""The situation (parties-Maoists deal) emerged on the backdrop of the NC deciding to remain impervious to the monarchy, the CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified-Marxist-Leninist)] to go to democratic republic and the Maoists' unilateral cease-fire,"" KC said, adding: ""Future political course will largely depend on how the king reacts to the understanding."" He also added that the understanding was made to give the Maoists a political space so that they could return to political mainstream. 
Standing Committee member of the CPN-UML, Pradip Nepal, opined that the CPN-Maoist's Central Committee decision to abide by universal values of democracy was a true realization on their part that arms struggle would not be a panacea to political problems. ""The political parties have realized their responsibility to the nation twice, the first when they forged an alliance on 8 May and the second when they reached an understanding with the Maoists on 22 November,"" he said, adding that the alliance succeeded in convincing the Maoists to multiparty democracy and human rights. 
He also said that lasting peace in the country was impossible without addressing the issues raised by the insurgents and that Maoists' arms could not be handed over to any other agency than the United Nations. General Secretary of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandi Devi), Hridayesh Tripathi, who was one of the alliance leaders to hold talks with the Maoist leadership, said that the main objective of the understanding was to draft a new constitution through the constituent assembly election and restructure the state mechanism that is in existence for the last 237 years.

At least two dozen policemen and protesters were injured as police charged with bamboo batons and demonstrators retaliated by throwing bricks. Police then bundled about 400 of the protesters into cargo trucks at the main market area of Katmandu.
Monday marked the 18th straight day of protests against King Gyanendra's October 2002 dismissal of an elected government and its replacement with one loyal to the monarchy.
Since then, thousands have frequently rallied across the country to demand polls and the restoration of Parliament. Some of the protests have turned violent.
On Monday, about 10,000 people marched waiving red-and-white party flags and chanting ""We want democracy, we want our rights.""
Hundreds of policemen had been stationed around the city to quell the protests. The detainees were taken to police stations where they would be questioned and freed, said one police official at the scene.
The demonstrations are being organized by the country's five largest political parties, including the Nepali Congress and the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal to demand that King Gyanendra restore the country's elected government.
The king dissolved Parliament and fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in October 2002, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control a Maoist insurgency. He then assumed executive powers and replaced the government with pro-monarchy politicians.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 for a communist state. More than 9,000 people have been killed in the rebellion.
The king promised last month to hold parliamentary elections within a year, but that move has failed to quell the demonstrations. The latest string of protests began on April 1 and organizers have vowed not to stop until their demands are met.

Earlier on Sunday, the second largest party in the ruling seven-party alliance - the CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)] sought for a referendum to decide the fate of the monarchy in the country. The UML submitted a 23-point suggestion to the ICDC calling for a referendum to decide the fate of the monarchy.
Meanwhile, on Sunday (30 July), the government and the Maoists had further extended the deadline for finalizing the draft constitution after the ICDC missed the second deadline that ended on Saturday. An informal meeting of the talks teams of both the government and the rebels had extended the term by another 10 days after various political parties failed to submit their suggestions within the given deadline.

Brig. Gen. Sagar Pandey is the highest army officer to be killed by the rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to end the monarchy in this Himalayan kingdom.
Pandey and three soldiers riding in the same vehicle were killed near Bhaise, a town about 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Katmandu, the ministry said in a brief statement.
It did not give any more details.
Separately, three policemen were fatally shot by suspected rebels in the middle of a busy market in southern Nepal.
The policemen were killed in Nepalgunj, a city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu. It is the regional headquarters of Nepal's western region, the hardest hit by the insurgency.
Four men on motorcycles shot the policemen at point-blank range and fled under the cover of darkness, police said.
Although the market was crowded, no civilians were injured in the firing.
Police officials said they suspect the rebels were responsible for the killings.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the insurgents pulled out of peace talks in August, ending a seven-month cease-fire. At least 1,200 people have died in the recent fighting.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.
More than 8,200 people have been killed since the insurgency began.

 Ministry of Water Resources sanctioned 100 schemes under R&D Programme during last two years. Out of these 100 schemes, 43 were research schemes, 5 were Performance Evaluation studies, 3 were environment impact Evaluation Studies, 43 were water use efficiency studies and 6 were schemes related to Financial Assistance for seminar/workshops.
  The Government has approved a pilot scheme for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies, directly linked to agriculture with an outlay of Rs. 300 crores to be implemented during the remaining period of 10th Five Year Plan. The Flood Forecasting Network is being upgraded by way of installation of modern data collection/data communication system. Besides the State plan funds, the Government of India is providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up priority flood management works. 
  Restoration of Water Bodies
  A pilot scheme for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies, directly linked to agriculture, has been approved by the Government with an outlay of Rs. 300 crores to be implemented during the remaining period of X Five Year Plan. 1116 water bodies have been selected for regeneration at an estimated cost of Rs. 229.7925 crore in 24 districts of 14 States identified under the scheme. An additional irrigation potential of 148113.35 hectare is likely to be generated after completion of the project.
  Flood Management 
  A Task Force for Flood Management/Erosion Control was constituted under the Chairman, Central Water Commission to look into the problems of reaccuring floods and erosion in Assam and other neighbouring States as well as Bihar, West Bengal and Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The Task Force had since submitted its report on 31st December 2004, as per schedule. 
  Flood Forecasting
  On an average about 6000 flood forecasts are issued every year by Central Water Commission. Over 96% of forecasts issued by CWC are found to be within permissible limit of accuracy which is + 15cm. in case of stage forecast and + I -20% of actual discharge in case of inflow forecast. Cooperation also exists with Nepal and Bhutan since 1989 and 1979 respectively to obtain the hydrological data in respect of common rivers, which help in qualitative improvements in flood forecasting on the Indian side. In 2002 the Government of India also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China for provision of hydrological information on the upstream of the Brahmaputra river in flood season by China to India. The data from China is being used for flood forecasting in the North Eastern Region. Matter has further been taken up with the Chinese authorities for providing similar information in respect of Sutlej river.
  The Flood Forecasting Network is being upgraded in the current plan by way of installation of modern data collection I data communication system to enable collection and transmission of real time data to forecast formulation centers and dissemination of the forecasts to user agencies for which a scheme estimated to cost Rs.72 crore has already been approved by the Government of India. In addition, it is also proposed under the scheme to start flood forecasting services at additional 18 stations by upgrading existing gauge I gauge & discharge sites or by establishing new gauge I gauge & discharge sites in addition to installation of 22 wireless stations.
  Financial Assistance provided to State Governments for Flood Management work 
  Besides the state plan funds, the Government of India at present is providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up priority flood management works. 
  Anti-erosion work in River Basins
  Under the scheme ""Improvement of drainage in critical areas of the country"", the financial assistance has been provided to the States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh during the 9th & 10th Five Year Plans for taking up various works for improvement of drainage due to floods.
  Further, the scheme on Critically anti-erosion works in coastal and other than Ganga basin States:-Coastal Protection works are planned and executed by the respective State Governments. However, in view of severity of the problems, Ministry of Water Resources has formulated Centrally Sponsored Scheme ""Critically anti-erosion works in coastal and other than Ganga basin States"" for anti-sea erosion works in critical areas which has been taken up by the Government of India in March, 2004 on pilot basis with an estimated cost of Rs.20.64 crore. The funding pattern of the scheme is 75:25 (Centre: State). Anti-sea erosion works for specific critical areas in Maharashtra, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry have been included in the scheme. Since April 2005 the scheme has been transferred to the State sector.

"7652",20112076,"Title: Better dead than Red_.rtf; Date: May 29, 2011 Sunday; Text: India, May 29 -- India won't brook a McCarthy to bludgeon the organised Left, but it is hurtling towards the precipice anyway due to its own fallacies and decline of its ideological appeal
As an ex-Communist, any critique I make of the Left runs the risk of being dismissed as the rant of a renegade. However, today the number of ex-Communists in the world probably exceeds that of the remaining faithful, which is why Communist parties would do well to analyse why so many have deserted their ranks. My personal tryst with the organised Left ended three decades ago before the collapse of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of the Marxist dream. In these decades, Communist parties have shrunk significantly both in size and influence. It hardly needs reminding that officially, Communist parties are in power only in China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba.
As for China, the ruling party is Communist only in name; its market economy bears no resemblance to socialism while, instead of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat envisioned by Marx and Lenin, what we have in Beijing is dictatorship of a party flaunting Marxist homilies without implementing them in practice. Vietnam's story is quite similar. Although the perverse form of dynastic dictatorship in Pyongyang may hold out for some more years, the writing is on the wall there too. The regime in Cuba is tottering and may be forced to yield power once the ailing revolutionary icon, Fidel Castro, leaves the scene. China is on the way to replace the erstwhile Soviet Union as a countervailing force against US hegemony in a unipolar world, but it does not represent the kind of ideological challenge to market capitalism and multi-party democracy the former USSR did.
With the Left losing power after 34 long years in West Bengal and also Kerala (although the latter may be temporary), democratically elected Communist regimes are perilously close to terminal decline. India and Nepal were the two countries where Communist influence thrived at a time when it was on the wane throughout Europe and getting transformed in Asia. The loss of power in West Bengal must hit the Indian Communist movement very hard for two reasons: It has devastated the illusion of permanence the CPI(M) nursed in what was the designated laboratory of socialism in India. Second, with the organised Communist parties' rout there is a clear and present danger that its infantile variant, namely Maoists, may well emerge as the principal moral force of the Left in India. That the Government in New Delhi would love that to happen is evident from its wooing of convicted terrorist ideologue Binayak Sen.
Reasons for the CPI(M)'s pre-scripted collapse in West Bengal have been doled out by all and sundry in recent weeks. Arrogance of power, detachment from the people, domination of the party by high-handed apparatchiks, failure to generate economic growth, cultural intolerance and other such factors have rightly been suggested for the Left's near-decimation. The question that should, however, really engage us is whether the organised Communist parties can rise from the ashes in the foreseeable future.
It is my assessment that the era of Leninist parties is well and truly over. By their very organisational structure, Communist parties can never internalise the ethos of countries in which they operate. The CPSU strenuously attempted to engineer the evolution of the 'Socialist Man' in Russia and its satellites during its 70-year stranglehold, but failed abysmally. Religion, which Stalin viciously sought to stamp out, is back with a bang in the former Socialist Bloc, so much so that Islamic extremism now poses a serious danger to the stability of several Central Asian republics. Communism and the highly regimented culture that it ushered was always an imposition from above, representing a hybrid organism that took roots nowhere.
Take the neighbourhood itself for example. Two Communist parties, Khalq and Parcham, led an uprising against the feudal monarchy of Zahir Shah. Despite financial and military backing of Brezhnev-era USSR, indigenous Communists were swept aside by the rising tide of Taliban and today it is impossible to find any trace of the Communist movement there. Similarly, the Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaj Party in Sri Lanka, once a major electoral force, has been obliterated from the island. Nepali Maoists are fighting a rearguard battle to stay relevant, while the ruling Communist Party is a pale pink shadow of the past.
The problem with the culture of Communist parties is the inherent belief in their own infallibility, resulting in a superiority complex being drilled into the psyche of the cadre. This follows from the Leninist dictum of the Party being the vanguard of the proletariat and hence bestowed with moral supremacy over 'the people', whom it is ordained to deliver from capitalist tyranny. This foundational principle militates against a democratic temperament: The 'ignorant' masses need to be led by t"

The blast occurred around 6:30 p.m. in Mainapokhari village of the Dolakha district, about 100 kilometers southeast of Kathmandu, the police said.
They blamed the Maoist rebels for the blast since they usually target police, army and security forces.
The insurgents may have thought the passenger bus was carrying security forces when they laid the mine, they said.
Later, the rebels also blew up another passenger bus in the Dhading district, about 100 km west of the capital, the police said, adding that no one was killed or injured because the rebels had ordered the passengers to get off the bus.
Maoist rebels also murdered a reporter of the Nepalese national news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti in the Sindupalchowk district of eastern Nepal on Sunday, the news agency reported.
Gyanendra Khadka was picked up from a local school while he attended a meeting with school teachers, the agency quoted the district's chief government official Rudra Nath Basyal as saying.
The rebels tied Khadka to a pole on the school's playground and killed him by slitting his throat with a sharp-edged weapon, the official added.
Government forces, meanwhile, waged fierce battles with insurgents in mountainous areas across the kingdom all day Sunday, the government said. The fighting left at least a dozen rebels and seven police and army soldiers dead.
Heavy fighting between government troops and rebels was going on overnight Sunday in the mountainous Rolpa district in midwestern Nepal and Solu at the foot of Mt. Everest.
The rebels have intensified their attacks on police and army positions after abandoning cease-fire and peace talks with the government last month.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal.
More than 8,000 people have been killed in the seven years of fighting between the government's security forces and the rebels.

 The Maoists have killed 150 government troops seizing 137 modern weapons from them in the Beni Bazar clashes during Saturday-Sunday 20-21 March , a pro-Maoist web site claimed late Sunday evening. According to the web site, the Western Central Command of the Maoists has taken responsibility for the attack in Beni Bazar, the district headquarters of Myagdi in western Nepal.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 22 Mar 04
A statement by the command, which the web site had quoted, further said that the Maoists have taken three dozen government officers and security personnel into their custody after the attack.
 The statement also claimed that Maoists have seized a two-inch mortar, three LMGs light machine-guns , 15 ""Insas"" Indian-made rifles , one M-16 rifle , eight SMGs sub-machine-guns , 35 SLRs self-loading rifles , 70 .303 rifles, 15 other pistols and 47,000 rounds of bullets from the security forces.
 In yet another statement issued late Sunday evening, Maoist chief Prachanda has claimed that only about 40 Maoists were killed in the Beni Bazar clashes including their brigade vice-commander. The figure as shown by Prachanda is opposite to what the army said on Sunday. Altogether 500 Maoists were killed and 200 more were injured in the clashes that saw 18 security personnel dead, according to the army.

Excerpt from report by Khim Ghale and Rishiram Poudel entitled: ""Chinese military supplies enter Nepal""; published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 25 November
Sindhupalchowk [central Nepal], 24 November: The first consignment of military supplies from China has entered Nepal. Eighteen truckloads of military supplies were brought to Nepal on Tuesday and Wednesday [22, 23 November].
According to a source, the first consignment of arms includes weapons and explosives meant for the Royal Nepalese Army [RNA]. However, the RNA has not confirmed the report. China had been providing communications equipment and non-lethal military supplies to the RNA for some time now. This is the first time [in recent years] that China supplied rifles and bullets. RNA had asked China to provide military supplies after India, the United States and the United Kingdom, the major providers of military assistance to Nepal, suspended the supply [after the royal takeover of 1 February].
The source said that 12 trucks of supplies entered Nepal from Khasa [a Chinese town near Nepal-China border in Sindhupalchowk] on Tuesday and six trucks of supplies entered on Wednesday. The vehicles were escorted by the Chinese army up to the Nepal-China border and from the border they were brought to Nepal on civilian vehicles by plainclothes RNA soldiers. RNA spokesperson Deepak Gurung said that he was unaware of arms supply. ""I don't have any information on this,"" he told Kantipur.
The source said Nepal was forced to search for alternatives after India and the United States suspended the supply of arms. After the 1 February move, King Gyanendra had spoken to the Chinese side [about supplying arms]. During Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey's visit to China, the Chinese government had pledged to provide assistance worth 8m yuan for unspecified projects.
Likewise, there had been an agreement between Chief of Army Staff of the RNA Gen Pyar Jung Thapa and his Chinese counterpart in Beijing in the third week of October according to which China would provide Nepal with military supplies worth 8m yuan.

 Kathmandu, 9 March: A US army team is in Kathmandu to conduct a joint military training exercise with the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) against terrorism.
 Director of the American Centre Constance Colding Jones said the team comprises 28 persons.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 10 Mar 04""Those in the team are officers as well as of other rank,"" an army official told this daily.
 According to Jones, the team will not go outside the Kathmandu Valley. The RNA will conduct joint training for American and Nepali soldiers for three weeks. The US military team is staying at Radisson Hotel.
 Though officials have termed the scheduled joint exercise as ""ongoing regular training exercise"", this is the first team to arrive this year for the purpose. The United States' Pacific Command has been conducting similar exercises for the last nine years.
 ""It is a regular joint training exercise that the United States and RNA teams have been conducting at least thrice annually since some time,"" said Jones, who is also press secretary at the American embassy.
 Last year similar exercises were conducted thrice according to the agreement relating to American military assistance to Nepal in fighting insurgency, signed two years back.

After deliberating for three days, a SAARC ministerial conference has asked its member states to formulate policies and programme in accordance with United Nation Security Council Resolution No 1325 to ensure adoption of gender sensitive approaches in rescue relief and rehabilitation in post-disaster situations and also in disaster preparedness plan. 
  The resolution could be of significance for the militancy hit North Eastern States, where women and children suffered the most. Last year, Assam recorded the highest civilian death toll of 293, surpassing even Jammu and Kashmir, where 271 people had fallen victim to terrorism during the same period. 
  Meanwhile, in an attempt to address violence against women (VAW), Sixth South Asian Regional Ministerial Conference has called for enactment of international guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights, in particular concerning persons living with HIV/AIDS. 
  Endorsing the declaration 'India Forward Moving Strategies for Gender Equality 2008,' passed here today, the regional group has pressed all its members countries to implement the SAARC Regional Convention on Combating the Crime of Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution. 
  The region has been witness to massive trafficking of women and children from countries like Bangladesh and Nepal, sending alarm bells ringing at the international level. 
  The Delhi Declaration asked member nations to enact or revise general anti-discrimination laws compatible with international human rights instruments, as well as, the international guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights, protect against involuntary HIV testing, guarantee confidentiality of results in all sectors ensure women's rights to sexual and reproductive health, including their reproductive choice. 
  The Declaration reminded members States to ensure that international commitments under Convention on Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the outcome document of the Beijing + 5 meeting are fulfilled in connection with elimination of violence against women. 
  The Conference that was inaugurated by President Pratibha Patil noted with concern rise in militarisation and terrorism, identifying them, as gaps and challenges. It cautioned against increase in religious fundamentalism and its negative impact on gender equality. 
  The increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS among women, including exposure to infections from husbands was cited as another area of conference.

 'We want one more shot at talks by ourselves (the government and the rebels) and call in the third party later if need be,' Information and Communication Minister Mohammad Mohsin, who is also the top government spokesman, told reporters.
 While this does not mean the government is not open to third-party mediation in a new round of dialogue, the planned third round of talks with the rebels would begin without a third party, the minister said.
The minister was explaining the government's position amid reports of concern shown by the United Nations on Nepal's ongoing conflict as well as its offer to mediate in restoring the peace process.
 According to reports in the local media, two senior U.N. officials are visiting Nepal later this week to explore ways of initiating a new round of dialogue.
 The minister also expressed skepticism over the outcome of peace talks held with U.N. involvement, saying, 'The U.N. too is no panacea. They have had problems in resolving conflicts elsewhere.'
 The most the government can offer at this juncture is U.N. involvement after the two parties commence the round, Mohsin said.
 The rebels have said no peace parley is possible with the current government headed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, but would consider negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.
 Rebels walked out of the second round of peace negotiations last August after the government declined to consider their demand of revoking the Constitution of 1990, which provides for parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy.
 Meanwhile, insurgency-related violence continues to hound the country, with the rebels killing two army soldiers Wednesday in an ambush in Lamjung district in central Nepal, about 90 kilometers southwest of the capital. The rebels also shot dead an assistant police inspector in Morang district Wednesday, local media reports said.

""We expect the death toll to be much higher … as reports could take as much as a week to reach us,"" said Durgaraj Sharma of Natural Calamity Disaster Management Center.
The landslides hit the villages Tuesday night in Okhaldhunga district, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the Nepalese capital, Katmandu.
Sharma said many were injured and houses were buried or damaged by debris. Rescuers were ferried to the area by helicopter to bring out the injured and to distribute packaged food, cooking utensils and plastic sheets for temporary shelters, since roads were blocked.
In Nepal's inundated southern region, reports said 10 people drowned and two were buried under landslides on Monday and Tuesday.
Phone lines have been cut and roads washed away by the floods, delaying information on deaths and damage from reaching officials.
A major concern is drinking water in inundated areas, where wells and pipelines have been contaminated and could spread waterborne disease, officials said.
Workers continued to clear the two main highways leading into Katmandu, after landslides severed the capital from the rest of the country. Officials said they hoped to partially open the highway for one-way traffic soon.
The weather has improved in the Himalayan kingdom's southern, central and western regions, and meteorologists predict it will get better as the week progresses.
Floods kill scores of people and leave thousands homeless in Nepal each year during the rainy season, which usually starts in early June. It began late this year, and is expected to last until September.

    However, long queues in petrol pumps in the capital city still  persisted due to lack of confidence among the consumers. According to the NOC officials, the company has been supplying more than  double the amount of gasoline than the regular demand in the  capital city from the beginning of this week. 
    Chief of Thankot depot of the state-owned NOC Dambar Bahadur  Basnet told Xinhua on Tuesday, normal demand for petrol in  Kathmandu is some 150,000 liters daily but the consumer's tendency to stockpile petrol is leading to excessive demands. Thankot depot is one of the major depots supplying gasoline to capital Kathmandu.
    The NOC is currently taking initiatives to bring the situation  under control with support from all concerned sides. The staffs of NOC have been working day and night to quench the thirst for  petrol displayed by the people of Kathmandu. ""Our staffs are at  the point of exhaustion as they have been working even during  holidays and odd hours,"" said Basnet.
    The petrol tankers ferrying petroleum products to Kathmandu  valley are being escorted by the security personnel due to the  recent unrest in the southern Terai plains of Nepal. According to  NOC sources, the Armed Police Force had been mobilized with the  authority to take necessary action to resume the transportation of petroleum products from India.
    The whole nation including capital Kathmandu has been  confronting petroleum shortage since mid-June last year when the  Madhesi groups launched general strikes, especially transportation strikes along south Nepal's Terai plains. The unrest almost  totally stopped Nepal's importation of petroleum products through  Nepal-India customs points in the south.
    The unrest Terai to some degree has been calming down since mid- March when most Madhesi groups called off their demonstration  programs.

The key leaders of the Seven Party Alliance and the Maoists are meeting in Kathmandu today to finalise the long-debated interim constitution.
During yesterday's discussion, both parties had agreed to list the points of disagreements and present them before the meeting.
The major differences lie on the model of election, criteria of reservation, procedure of appointments in constitutional bodies and fundamental rights.
 Both the sides have already agreed to adopt a mixed electoral system, in which 205 members will be elected from the current constituency based on the first-past-the-post system and 204 will be nominated by the parties in proportion to the popular votes garnered by them. According to a government source, negotiators are yet to finalize whether there should be two ballot papers and ballot boxes for the election, Kantipur daily reported.
Another difference revolves around whether the list of candidates for the purpose of proportional representation should be made public before the polls, the source said.
The parties are yet to agree on whether the constitution should clearly define the portion of representation for all minorities, marginalized people and women, or the debate should be left to the new Election Act.
The government is in favour of allowing the parties to decide how they want to ensure inclusive representation in the Constituent Assembly. 
There is no consensus yet on the national animal as the Maoists are in favour of replacing the existing ""cow"" with something else but there is no clear suggestion from their side. The government is unwilling to compromise on it.
Negotiators also failed to settle the difference over some fundamental rights suggested by the drafting committee.

Their decision came at a four-hour meeting of party leaders in Kathmandu after Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa made a fresh appeal to them to join the peace process.
""The upcoming talks with the Maoist rebels will essentially dwell on their political agenda,"" Thapa said in a speech broadcast on state television and radio late Monday.
""The next round of talks could pave way for progressive political reform… and successful peace talks demand cooperation from one and all specially from the political parties,"" he said.
Last week rebel leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda (The Fierce), said the parties should be included.
But the parties are boycotting Thapa's government as they object to King Gyanendra's sacking of the elected prime minister in October, after which he appointed royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand and postponed elections.
Chand resigned in May and the king replaced him with Thapa. The parties are demanding an all-party government or fresh elections.
Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), said they welcomed the Maoist proposal, but they would not join the talks.
""The rebels' proposal is positive but their leaders too should help us to defeat the forces of regression,"" Nepal said.
""A meaningful dialogue will only be possible after the formation of an all-party government,"" he said.
""If we agreed to participate in the Maoist-government peace dialogues, it would mean extending recognition to the Thapa government,"" said Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun Narsingh K.C.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has claimed over 7,800 lives.
They declared a ceasefire in January and have held two rounds of talks.
The process looked in danger of collapsing, until last week Prachanda said a third round of talks would be held soon.

"6915",2008542,"Title: Sojourners are there for detainees.rtf; Date: December 27, 2008 Saturday; Text: ""H-26,"" the guard yelled. ""You have a visitor.""
Locked in a windowless warehouse for three months, Ibrahim Cisse had long given up hope of anyone finding him. Now, his mind raced. How could he possibly have a visitor when no one in this country knew his name?
Nervously, he shuffled into the visitors room.
There, behind the glass partition, was a small woman with short brown hair and kind green eyes. Cisse stared at her suspiciously as he picked up the phone.
My name is Janet, she said, speaking in a soft voice in French. ""I came as a friend.""
Cisse's heart warmed at the sound of his own language. Still, he was cautious.
So many terrible things had happened since he had fled a gunfight on the streets of Abidjan and stowed away on a boat filled with crates of chocolate and cocoa. In America he was slapped in shackles, yelled at like a criminal, locked in jail first and then sent to this prison-like detention center. Here, days passed in a mind-numbing blur with little to do but lie on his bunk and ponder an unimaginable future.
An immigration judge had ordered him deported, but because he had no passport or papers, the Ivory Coast refused to take him back. Cisse was a man without a country, without hope, without contact with the outside world.
Gently, Janet Curley coaxed him. How could she help? What did he need?
He wanted to learn English so that he could understand what was happening. He wanted to find out about his family in Africa. Most of all, he wanted to be free.
I will teach you English, she said.
The next Saturday she arrived with alphabet letters and words and pictures. Over the static-filled phone connection, Cisse had his first English lesson. He learned how to say ""pineapple.""
And so began an extraordinary journey, a friendship forged in the unlikeliest of settings, through a grubby glass partition in the visitors room of a detention center where 300 immigrants none of whom are charged with a crime are imprisoned.
Cisse, 27, spent 16 months in detention before being released on parole. Today, he calls the 49-year-old court clerk ""Momma."" She loves him like her own family.
In those weekly visits, Cisse says, Janet made me feel like a human being again.
In a searing, first-person account, Fauziya Kassindja, a Togolese teenager who applied for asylum to escape female genital mutilation, described her 14 months in detention at Elizabeth. The terrible isolation and uncertainty, she wrote, was made even more unbearable by the fact that no one came to visit.
Her 1998 book, ""Do They Hear You When You Cry,"" so disturbed a group of congregants at the Riverside Church in Manhattan that they decided to take action. They would visit detainees who had no other visitors. They would listen to their cries.
And so, on Saturdays and Tuesdays, a small band of people climb into a church van and drive 15 miles to Elizabeth. They come from all backgrounds: social workers, professors, students, doctors, nurses, an engineer, a court clerk. Their mission is simple: just show up, to be a friendly face for an hour and make a commitment to be a real friend.
They call themselves Sojourners. In 10 years of visits they have transformed some detainee lives but many say their own lives have been transformed as well.
""We try to bring some humanity into a place that is so dehumanizing,"" Curley says.
It is not an easy task.
The detention center is housed in a brown brick building on a bleak industrial stretch near Newark airport, a place studded with tire shops, warehouses, a strip club and a diner. Outside an American flag flutters next to a red one stamped CCA, for Corrections Corporation of America, the private prison contractor that runs the center. Inside, immigrants are detained indefinitely some for months and years while the government decides what to do with them.
Some have fled persecution in their country and applied for asylum after landing at a U.S. airport. Others were rounded up in raids because of problems with their paperwork or because they had no paperwork. Some were caught at the border.
Their numbers have soared in recent years in the wake of tougher immigration laws, an intense new focus on deportation and a reorganization of the system after Sept. 11, 2001. About 350,000 people are now deported annually, up from about 100,000 in the years before 2001. Most spend time in detention.
""Why was I locked up when I had not committed a crime?"" cries Speciose Murekatete, a 40-year-old Rwandan who, with her husband, spent a year and a half in Elizabeth. ""Why could I not hug my husband for more than a year? Why could I get no fresh air? Why could I not see the sun? Why could I not wear my own clothes?""
Immigration officials refuse to directly answer these questions. But they defend detention as a necessary program, one designed to protect the country from undesirables and terrorists and to protect the detainees as well.
""Our mission is to detain and remove as many illegal aliens as possible, and"

Nepal's military denies that its forces commit widespread abuses, and action has been taken against any troops who do, a military spokesman said in response to the human rights group's report Wednesday.
Fighting between government troops and Maoist rebels escalated after King Gyanendra seized absolute power in February in a move decried by Western nations as anti-democratic. Key donor nations suspended military aid after the takeover, but have since eased their restrictions.
Amnesty International asked the United States, Britain and India to halt all military aid to Nepal, saying that the aid is facilitating the killing, torture and disappearance of thousands of civilians since 2001.
The London-based group asked those countries ""to suspend all transfers of arms and related logistical and security supplies to Nepal until the Nepalese government takes clear steps to halt human rights violations and bring those responsible to justice.""
Amnesty also asked the rebels to end all attacks on civilians, quit recruitment of children and investigate any abuses by its cadres and ensure that culprits are removed from their posts.
Nepalese officials have repeatedly said they have improved the human rights record of their forces. Both army troops and police officers are now required to receive training in protecting peoples' rights.
""The security forces is committed toward protecting human rights,"" Royal Nepalese Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Deepak Gurung said.
Forty-eight officers have been jailed on various charges and disciplinary action has been taken against 68, Gurung said. One soldier is facing rape charges, and several other cases are being investigated, he said.
Amnesty said the Nepalese government must stop extrajudicial killings, all forms of sexual violence, arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions as well as torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
""Military aid and arms supplies to Nepal from countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom and India have facilitated the killing, torture and 'disappearance' of thousands of civilians,"" the group said in its report Wednesday.
The report does not detail the cases or say how it arrived at its approximate total of ""thousands"" of civilians victimized.
Amnesty said it wants donor nations to suspend any military and security assistance, including non-lethal and dual-use equipment that that could be used for military purposes.

4. Konare says all the political parties he met in Haiti, including the Lavalas Family, have shown that they have good will. According to him, this is a true sign that they want to fight violence in Haiti. He said among other things: ""Our conversations went fine with everybody. They were fraternal, straight and direct. I did not feel in any of the parties I met a willingness to exclude the others. We must help one another so everybody can take part in the elections of 2005. This is very important."" For her part, Anne-Marie Issa of the Council of Eminent Persons (COEP) says the Lavalas partisans do not associate themselves to Aristide. She pleads in favour of unity in Haiti. She adds: ""I think that the Haitian problem is not the Lavalas, the Lavalas Family. We in the COEP think that the problem is not the Lavalas party."" Furthermore, she says: ""Mr Konare also observed that the Lavalas supporters like the country. Somebody who says Lavalas does not mean Aristide."" (2 min)

""On behalf of the government and also on behalf of the COEP, if they allow me to do so, I am thanking him Konare for his visit to the country and for having met all political leaders, all members of the civil society and the private sector. Konare is the first African statesman to visit Haiti. The year 2005 will be a year of reunion between Haiti and Africa. We are first and foremost Haitians.

"6674",20083492,"Title: Nepal police detain 55 protesting Tibetans.rtf; Date: April 17, 2008 Thursday 7:50 AM GMT; Text: Police detained at least 55 Tibetan exiles in Nepal's capital on Thursday as they tried to stage a protest outside the Chinese embassy, police said.
""We have arrested around 55 Tibetan protesters from around the embassy,"" Basanta Rajouria, a police officer at the scene, told AFP.
About 200 police were on duty to block protesters from reaching the embassy.
The protesters were quickly bundled into police vans as they arrived shouting ""Stop killing in Tibet"" and ""We want a free Tibet."" 
In a sign that Nepal may be getting tougher on the pro-Tibet protests, about 115 Tibetan exiles who were arrested Wednesday had not been released by Thursday afternoon.
In previous protests, police have detained the protesters for several hours and then released them without charge late in the evening.
""It's a home ministry decision not to release them. They have not been charged with anything and we don't know how long we will hold them,"" another senior police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Nepal is home to at least 20,000 Tibetans, who began arriving in large numbers in 1959 after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet following a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
Sandwiched between regional giants India and China, Nepal's government recognises Beijing's ""One China"" policy, which sees Taiwan and Tibet as inseparable parts of China.
Worldwide protests erupted after China's recent crackdown on demonstrators inside Tibet marking the anniversary of the failed uprising.

    A dissident group of the CPN-M formed the new party to revolt "" against the mother party"". The faction, CPN-M (United Rebel Front), accused the CPN-M of not respecting the people's mandate and  deviating from party policy for positions in the government.
    ""We'll stage the second People's War and third People's  Movement to secure people's rights and to overthrow the orthodox  regime,"" said Janalal Thapa, the valley coordinator of the newly  formed faction, on Sunday.
    The People's War is what CPN-M called since 1996 during the  decade-long insurgency, while the Second People's Movement in last April ended King Gyanendra's direct rule.
    Organizing a press conference, the new faction sought the  resignation of the government led by Prime Minister Girija Prasad  Koirala.

 Presenter The Speaker of the House of Representative Taranath Ranabhat has said he will not support the idea of a constituent assembly or a referendum even if his party the Nepali Congress or the king endorses the idea. Speaking at an event at the Reporters' Club in the capital today he not only criticized the Nepali Congress for officially discussing the idea of a constituent assembly, but also warned of the possibility of the country breaking up.
 Taranath Ranabhat I do not believe that a constituent assembly will necessarily bring peace to the country. It may in fact open the doors for insecurity and anarchy in the country. I also do not believe that the constituent assembly will address the unity of the country; it will again open the doors for the disintegration of the country. It will also not address communal harmony and cultural diversity of the country. It will only bring about ethnic and communal violence in the country.

Presenter Stating that the present constitution can find a way out of the present crisis in the country, Ranabhat said he will be active in generating opposition to the idea of a constituent assembly. He said the king and the parliamentary parties must be act as a unified force to isolate the Maoists. He argued that the Maoists were a force to be reckoned with today because of the in-fighting between democratic forces in the country.

Sharma Oli, is returning on Wednesday to Kathmandu, where talks between the Maoist leadership and the seven-party alliance government are critically poised. According to his original schedule, Oli was due to travel to Thiruvananthapuram and Kolkata from New Delhi, before returning to Nepal on Saturday.
  According to a political analyst, the talks in Kathmandu, though near agreement, with both sides agreeing on how to manage the Maoist armaments, are deadlocked on the issue of the future of the monarchy and the exact quantum of seats to be allocated to the Maoists in government. Oli, a member of the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), is considered crucial to help break the impasse.
  Delivering the Dinesh Singh Memorial Lecture at the Indian Council of World Affairs on Tuesday, Oli was mildly critical of the Maoist role so far, saying they have not halted their violent activities yet.
  ""The Maoists are still carrying out the policy of unabated extortion, intimidation and extortion, activities that pose obstacles to the ongoing peace process, but as we all know the talks are in the final stage of positive conclusion."" ""Success of the peace process,"" Oli said, ""will critically depend on the positive deed and demeanour of the Maoist leaders and their commitment to be a peaceful political force.""
  In the printed invitation card, issued by ICWA, Oli was scheduled to speak on the subject ""Recent Developments in Nepal: Foreign Policy Implications."" Instead, Oli spoke on the theme of ""Working together for Shared Peace and Prosperity,"" a definite shift, indicative that his government was close to an agreement. ""Successful resolution of Maoist conflict in Nepal through peaceful means will have a salutary impact on regional peace and security,"" he said.
  Reflecting the SPA government's new pragmatic approach towards neighbouring India, Oli said, ""Nepal can benefit from a rapidly growing India in terms of expanded markets, increased Indian tourist arrivals, enhanced jobs and scaled up technology transfer."" Significantly, as sharing water resources has been a sticky issue in the past, Oli said, ""The two countries can benefit enormously by harnessing the abundant water resources of Nepal to meet the rising energy needs of India to fuel its rapid economic growth."" ""The best way to proceed,"" he said, ""would be to begin addressing political issues and to promote regional economic integration simultaneously, without making one a precondition for the other.""

 Text of report entitled: ""Full text of King Gyanendra's message to the nation on the occasion of Dashain festival"", attributed to RSS news agency, published by Nepalese state-owned newspaper Gorkhapatra on 12 October
 Beloved Countrymen,
 On the auspicious occasion of the festival of Bada Dashain, we extend our best wishes to all Nepalese and Hindus, living within the country or abroad, for happiness, peace and prosperity. This festival inspires us to continuously strive towards attaining peace, justice and dignity, reminding us that truth always triumphs.
 Patriotism can be the only focal point for Nepalese, who are proud of their glorious history as an ever-independent nation and their ability to resolve by themselves mutual differences and difficulties facing the nation. In fact, this is also the distinctive characteristic of us Nepalese. Guided by this, we must ensure that the country tides over the current difficult phase so that the dignity of the nation so assiduously safeguarded by our forefathers inspires generations to come.
Gorkhapatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 12 Oct 05, p 1
During the past eight months, there has been a decline in terrorist activities due to the dedicated efforts of our dutiful security personnel and the cooperation of our determined, patriotic countrymen. As a result, the people have now begun to feel more secure. Yet, in keeping with the people's aspirations as well as the nation's need, all of us must remain ever alert and active in safeguarding the nation and democracy against terrorism. Meaningful multiparty democracy is possible only by re-energising representative institutions through free and fair elections. Therefore, to honour the collective wisdom of all enfranchised Nepalese, everyone with faith in multiparty democracy must contribute to its consolidation by participating in the forthcoming municipal elections.
 We have commanded the Election Commission to conduct elections to the House of Representatives within the year 2063 B.S. [mid-April 2007] by further strengthening the favourable environment created with the holding of the municipal elections. We also call on the international community, which believes in democracy, to actively assist in ensuring that the electoral process is dignified, free, and fair. There should now be no delay on the part of those who have been misguided in discarding violence and dedicating themselves to the welfare of the nation and people by engaging in competitive democratic politics.
 In order to safeguard the very essence of our national existence, there can always be a dignified basis for overcoming differences through mutual understanding. Therefore, we would like to make it clear that the door to joining the political mainstream is open to all, giving due consideration to the nation's requirements and the people's aspiration as well as their responsibility towards the legacy of history.
 To ensure a happy and prosperous future for the Nepalese people with the establishment of sustainable peace in the greater interest of our Motherland, may Goddess Nava Durga Bhawani inspire all patriotic Nepalese to work in unison to initiate a new era in our history. Jaya Nepal!

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 25 May
 Kanchanpur [far-west Nepal], 24 May: Locals of the Parasan Village Development Committee dismantled pillars today which were erected by India after an encroachment into Nepalese territory. The locals geared up to take action after the Nepalese government did not react to Indian encroachment into Kanchanpur District's southern region.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 25 May 05Even the Indian officials have admitted the encroachment.
 Thousands of enraged Nepalese locals demolished new border pillars and half a dozen ""reference pillars"" erected by the Indian side in Nepalese territory. To assess the situation, a team of political leaders, human rights activists and media persons from Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi [adjoining districts] went to the site today. [Passage omitted on pillars being destroyed last year.]
 Locals who accompanied the study team were armed with axes and other digging equipment, and shouted: ""Those who sell the nation must be brought to book."" More than 500 students of the National High School attended the rally organized by locals. The erection of these border pillars meant that some parts of the school fell onto the Indian side of the border.
 A Nepal-India Joint Border Survey Team re-demarcated the border and as a result some of the areas fell onto the Indian side. Last week, at a meeting held between officials of the two countries, India admitted that there was encroachment onto Nepalese territory and ordered the [Indians] to stop digging trenches there. [Passage omitted on pillar reference numbers, technical details]
 An action committee against border encroachment has been formed. Din Bandhu Aryal is the chairman of the committee.

Sobhraj, known as ""the serpent"" because of his talent for disguise and escape, is thought to have killed at least 20 people in India, Thailand, Afghanistan, Turkey, Nepal, Iran and Hong Kong.
He was held for two decades in New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar prison, but deported without charge to his home country of France in 1997.
Sobhraj resurfaced in Nepal's capital of Katmandu last September. He was arrested at a posh casino there and charged with the killing of two Western backpackers, whose charred bodies were found on the outskirts of the capital in 1975.
On Monday, the Katmandu District Court was scheduled to wrap up the trial and issue a verdict.
However, Judge Bisowmbar Shrestha instead asked the police department to present original documents related to the case. It was not clear why the police had initially given only photo copies.
""The judge has postponed the final hearing for another day and asked the police to present the original documents,"" said Sanjeev Ghimire, Sobhraj's lawyer. ""This is only delaying the verdict on the case and my client will have to stay in custody for another few days.""
Sobhraj, 59, was born in Vietnam during French colonial rule, but claims French citizenship. He has admitted in the past to killing Western tourists but has never been convicted of murder.
He also faces charges of immigration violations for allegedly using a fake passport to enter Nepal in 1975.

He said that power gained through violent rebellion would not last long and at the same time Nepal could become an international pariah, and requested the Maoists to do a rethink.

"1630",20043086,"Title: From the Himalayas to the South Pacific, _climate witnesses_ testify about global warming.rtf; Date: December 10, 2004, Friday, BC cycle; Text: A Nepalese Sherpa fears his mountain valley will be flooded by melting glacier runoff high in the Himalayas. A Fiji islander frets about rising sea levels, while villagers cope with the destruction of mangrove swamps in India.
As scientists debate whether global warming is affecting Earth, ""climate witnesses"" told a U.N. environmental conference Friday they are already feeling the heat of the changing weather patterns they say are drastically affecting the way of life from the Himalayas to the South Pacific.
""In the past we just accepted it was the will of God,"" said Penina Moce, a woman from Udu, a fishing village in Fiji. ""But now we believe there could be other reasons.""
Moce spoke as delegates from nearly 200 countries sat down in Buenos Aires for an annual gathering by government officials, scientists, and environmentalists aimed at trying to reduce ""greenhouse"" emissions believed by many to be causing a rise in Earth's temperatures.
The 44-year-year-old mother of five said many on her South Pacific island of 400 people are alarmed by recent signs of altering climate: shortened rainy seasons, eroding coastlines and dwindling fish stocks. Water, already in short supply, has become even harder to come by, she said.
""When it rains, everyone will leave whatever they're doing and rush outside to try and save as much water as possible,"" she said. ""We are lucky if it rains for two days straight.""
Environmentalists say her testimony exemplifies what is occurring in some areas affected by global warming and climate change - issues the world has tried to address through the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement requiring initial cuts in ""greenhouse gas"" emissions by 2012 that comes into force in February.
With only a few months remaining before Kyoto takes effect, the science over global warming remains divided. The United States - the largest industrialized country not to join the treaty - has cited scientific uncertainties as one of the reasons.
Debate has dragged on for decades over the causes of climate change and whether it is already being felt.
Many scientists believe carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases - released by factories, vehicles and coal-burning power plants - seriously threaten life on Earth by causing a gradual rise in the planet's temperature. Global warming has been blamed for more violent storms, rising sea levels and shrinking animal habitats.
Caspar Ammann, a scientist and climatologist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said changes are apparent around the world.
""You see the massive changes in the mountain ranges around the world. Where you see the glaciers disappearing very rapidly, you see changes in vegetation and changes in the whole seasonal cycles. The sea ice that is going back … these are indications.""
A study by Tom Wigley and Sarah Raper of the Climatic Research Unit in Britain found a 90 percent probability global temperatures will rise 3.1 to 8.9 degrees between 1990 and 2100 as a result of human influences if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked.
Other experts disagree, saying Earth's temperatures have varied greatly over time, and little is known about how the atmosphere copes with temperature change.
""If you look at the long-term records of temperatures, you will see periods warmer than today and periods colder than today,"" said John Cristy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama.
""We don't see the same warming in the deep atmosphere,"" he said. ""If it were man-made, that's where you would see the warming.""
But Anil Krishna Mistry, a 37-year-old rice farmer living in mangrove swamps along India's border with Bangladesh, said he is worried by what he sees as changing climate patterns.
He said the region is under constant threat of flooding from heavy rains and that rising sea levels have washed away huge tracts of land and made others too salty for rice growing.
""There were 64 types of mangrove plants in the region, but now half of those species are dying out,"" said Krishna Mistry. ""The mangrove stands act as a barrier against high tides from the oceans,"" he said, but rising sea levels and high tides are making the freshwater salty.
He said subsistence farmers are losing rice paddies and freshwater drinking supplies to the rising saltwater tides and that many try to survive by poaching and by overfishing in the 104 islands in the region.
""We are surrounded by water, but don't have a single drop to drink,"" Krishna Mistry said. ""The changes in monsoon patterns are leading to more unpredictable weather. Many people are living on the edge, with no other place to go.""
Norbu Sherpa, an expedition guide in the Himalayas, also warned of a changing landscape in the Everest region.
""In the years that I have worked as a trekking expedition guide, I have seen snow lines and glaciers go back higher and higher, he said. ""Meanwhile, new lakes are forming, others are growing larger and larger.""

 Kathmandu, 17 April: If the policemen are becoming less successful in bringing under control the joint movement launched by the five political parties against the king's October 4 2004 move after it took on a more effective form since Saturday 17 April , then the policemen are starting to go out of control of their officers.
 Along with the big increase in the people's participation in the movement, even trucks carrying the policemen are coming under incendiary attacks due to incitement in the movement.

Likewise, the policemen, having lost control over the prohibited area, are being forced to sit and listen to strident slogans being raised against the institution of monarchy.
 On Saturday 17 April large numbers of protesters gained control over the eastern part of Rata Park, northern part of the Exhibition Road, the western part of Dillibazar west and the southern part of Kamaladi and the policemen were forced to retreat.  Passage omitted: If riot policemen, from time to time, were able to break the cordons of protesters in those areas, they we chased out by stone pelting protesters then the protesters set fire to two trucks used to ferry the policemen

"7295",20115773,"Title: Maoist supremo trying to split party says Chand.rtf; Date: October 10, 2011 Monday; Text: KATHMANDU: Unified CPN-Maoist standing committee member Netra Bikram Chand 'Biplav' today came down heavily on the establishment side, the alliance of party Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' and Vice-chairperson Baburam Bhattarai, for calling a national conclave to split the party.
Speaking at an interaction, Chand remarked that the Prachanda-Bhattarai alliance has falsely described the conclave as 'an official jamboree' of the party.
""I have urged party chairperson 'Prachanda' to
call off the national gathering of the party slated for October 15 and 16 as it will push the party towards disintegration.
The establishment should be held responsible for the consequences of the gathering,"" Chand said, accusing Dahal of calling the conclave instead of the central committee meeting to avoid criticism.
Chand opined that the Baburam Bhattarai-led government has lost its legitimacy after deciding to hand over the keys of the arms containers to the Special Committee.
He accused Bhattarai of betraying the party and said the government has become weak in the absence of support from the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. The Maoist leader maintained that the four-point deal reached with the United Democratic Madhesi Front cannot be implemented without cooperation from the NC and UML.

"5964",20072867,"Title: Nepal royals dealt new blow on top of prince's heart attack.rtf; Date: September 7, 2007 Friday 10:52 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's biggest political party landed a potentially knock-out blow to the embattled monarchy on Friday by declaring it  wanted the kingdom to become a republic.
The policy shift by the Nepali Congress Party, which has traditionally supported keeping a ceremonial king, came as King Gyanendra's only son and heir languished in hospital after suffering a heart attack.
Doctors said Crown Prince Paras, an unpopular playboy accused of nightclub brawls, fast driving and reckless living in one of the world's poorest countries, was ""recovering well.""
But the Congress party signalled the days of the two century-old dynasty were nearly over.
""The central working committee of Nepali Congress has decided, in principle, to vouch for a federal republic,"" Nepali Congress chief whip Ananda Prasad Dhungana told AFP.
He said the decision would be voted on later this month by a bigger party meeting, and if approved would mean the ""Nepali Congress will officially stand for a federal republic"" to be declared after elections set for November.
Narhari Acharya, a Congress central committee member, said Nepal's oldest and largest party had taken a ""most important"" decision to ditch the king.
The move represented a major shift for the Nepali Congress, said Kapil Shrestha, a political science professor from Tribhuvan University.
""For the past 50 years the party (Nepali Congress) had engaged in political exercise working in cooperation with the king but they have now realised it has been a failure,"" Shrestha said.
""The Nepali Congress party was the last hope for the king and his hopes must have been dashed now,"" he said.
Already unpopular when he came to the throne after a palace massacre blamed on a drunken crown prince in 2001, King Gyanendra garnered widespread condemnation when he sacked the government and assumed direct control in February 2005.
He was forced to end his direct rule in April 2006 after sidelined political parties and rebel Maoists organised massive nation-wide protests.
The rebels went on to sign a peace deal and take up positions in parliament and an interim cabinet, and have been campaigning hard for the monarchy to be abolished.
The Unified Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (UML), the Himalayan nation's second biggest party, also wants a republic.
Veteran Congress leader and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had said in the past that some space should be left for the monarchy in Nepal, including the suggestion that Paras's four-year-old son Hridayendra be declared king.
But top Congress politician Acharya said now ""the Nepali Congress, UML and the Maoists have all now taken a republican stance.""
""I think this means that the place of a monarchy in Nepali politics has ended,"" he said.
The party move capped a traumatic week for the king, who was traditionally considered to be the living incarnation of a Hindu god.
On Thursday, Gyanendra's only son suffered what doctors said was a ""major"" heart attack -- a common occurrence in Nepal's royal family and apparently aggravated by the 36-year-old Paras' playboy lifestyle.
""Prince Paras is under regular observation and he is recovering well,"" Shyam Bahadur Pandey, one of the doctors treating the prince, said Friday.
""He had high levels of cholesterol and blood pressure, so we are going to advise him to control his diet once he gets better,"" Pandey said.
The crown prince has been mired in controversy, with accusations against him including drunken armed assaults in Kathmandu discotheques, speeding through the streets of Kathmandu on his Harley Davidson motorcycle and beating police officials.
Tens of thousands of Nepalis signed a petition calling for action against the prince in 2000 when his vehicle struck and killed a popular singer. No action was taken.
His motorcade was stoned in Kathmandu in December 2005. Paras later suspended three senior police officials, accusing them of failing to provide proper security.

"5955",20071645,"Title: Nepal village officials refuse returning to workplaces, cite insecurity.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: December 22, 2007 Saturday
Excerpt from report by Rajendra Karki headlined ""Nepal local body officials still refusing to return to their village postings"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 22 December
Jajarkot [district in mid-west Nepal], 21 December: Even a year and a half after the return of peace to the country, the village development committee secretaries of Jajarkot district have not returned to their villages. 
The secretaries, who have been staying at district headquarters Khalanga for the past eight years, citing lack of security during the Maoist armed conflict, have used various excuses for not yet returning to the villages. With the secretaries not returning to the villages, the local people have been deprived of various government services and facilities. The secretaries are operating out of rented rooms at district headquarters and carrying out all work related to the village development committees. 
With the secretaries staying put at the district headquarters, work such as the registration of marriages, births and deaths, formation of consumer committees, partnership with NGOs and recommendations for various purposes has been affected. 
The old compulsion faced by villagers of coming all the way to the district headquarters even for minor business has not been overcome with the return of peace. 
[Passage omitted: villager quoted to same effect] 
Local people are complaining that the village development committee secretaries are continuing to remain at the district headquarters on various excuses even after the return of peace. Meanwhile, the district development committee office in Jajarkot has said that it has told all village development committee secretaries to return to their villages immediately. The 30 village development committees in Jajarkot are currently being run by 17 secretaries. Given the lack of secretaries, one secretary is working on up to three village development committees.
