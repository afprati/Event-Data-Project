"465",2003303,"Title: After Nepal Killings, a Tough King Gets U.S. Backing.rtf; Date: August 4, 2003 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
This fairy tale kingdom gone awry, perched among the world's most spectacular mountains, is once again seething with intrigue and rumor, caught in dramas involving its monarchy, its striving for democracy and outside powers. 
     Two years ago Nepal was shaken to its core when the royal family was all but wiped out in a murky attack that was officially attributed to Crown Prince Dipendra, who also died. Now the country is wondering whether an unsteady six-month cease-fire with Maoist guerrillas can survive during off-and-on peace negotiations. 
 There is an ever-shifting struggle here among three power centers: the Hindu monarchy, which has sustained the country for more than 200 years; the far weaker political parties, born in the 1990's after calls for more democracy; and the Maoists. 
Fearful that Nepal could descend into chaos or became a haven for terrorists, outside powers -- the United States, Britain and India -- are pouring in aid for the government. But the United States, which is providing $17 million to turn the parade-ground royal army into an anti-insurgent force, may find itself backing a tough king whose democratic credentials are in doubt. 
King Gyanendra, a wealthy businessman, took the throne after the palace killings as a constitutional monarch of limited powers. But now he has taken full control, dismissing Parliament, putting off new elections and appointing a royalist prime minister over the objections of the major political parties. 
The parties have broadly discredited themselves with corruption, ineffectiveness and revolving door governments, and they fear that the king will make a deal with the Maoists and move them even further onto the margins of power. 
""What is the king's role?"" Girija Prasad Koirala, leader of the large Nepali Congress Party, asked at a recent party gathering. ""I conclude that these are parts of the design already reached between the king and the Maoists."" 
During the cease-fire, the Maoists became very public, opening an office in the capital, holding rallies and giving speeches. Then, in mid-July, the office was closed and the Maoist leaders dropped out of sight. Later, the Maoists sent a message to government mediators demanding to deal directly with the king. 
""A strange phenomenon in a very strange country,"" a Western diplomat said. 
A Nepalese journalist, Mana Ranjan Josse, said: ""Seeing is not believing here. Everything is not what meets the eye."" 
The Maoist rebellion in the countryside has its roots in complex religious, ethnic and tribal realities, along with deep poverty -- per capita income is $220 a year and even less in remote areas -- and the concentration of the meager resources in a few hands. About 85 percent of the 24 million mostly poor people are Hindu. The top two castes, 29 percent of the population, hold most of the government jobs. 
The Shah family, which founded the Nepalese kingdom in 1768, and the Rana family, which ruled through hereditary prime ministers from 1846 to 1950 with the king as a figurehead, have so intermarried that they have formed an aristocracy that controls much of the wealth. 
""The reasons for discontent are real,"" the Western diplomat said. But he was critical of the guerrillas nonetheless. ""When the Maoists started,"" he said, ""they got a lot of sympathy from intellectuals, but it has dissipated because of their brutality."" 
More than 7,000 people have been killed since the Maoists went into the jungle in 1996, and Amnesty International and other groups have recorded charges of widespread human rights abuses on both sides. The army and security forces have killed and tortured civilians, human rights groups say, while the rebels have executed local officials and teachers, blown up government aid centers and public works projects, and financed themselves with bank robberies and extortions. 
Rebellion flared here in 1990 with the formation of the People's Movement, which demanded multiparty democracy. Demonstrations led to riots and some 300 protesters were killed. Finally, under foreign pressure, the royal family caved in. A new Constitution was written in 1990, intended to establish a symbolic monarchy somewhat along the lines of Britain, and an elected Parliament. 
But the system has been a bitter disappointment. The new king, Gyanendra, was known to have argued in family circles against the Constitution approved by his older brother, King Birendra, who was among those killed in June 2001. King Gyanendra's extensive holdings -- some of which were reported not to have paid taxes -- include tea plantations, hotels and a cigarette factory. 
Last October, the new king dismissed the government in a proclamation assailing its ""incompetence"" and appointed his own prime minister. He cited Article 127 of the Constitution, which outlines the monarch's ""power to remove difficulties."" 
But Devendra Raj Panday, a former minister who helped write the Constitution, says Article 127 does"

The abductions from two separate schools in Chaimale village Sunday were the first ever in the Kathmandu valley, a police spokesman said.
""It is not known why they were abducted but it seems the rebels want to show they can do it even in the capital under the very nose of the government,"" he said.
""This was the first time that students have been kidnapped from the southern outskirts of the capital city,"" he added.
The students and teachers were abducted from Krishna Secondary School and Panchakanya Primary School, both just four kilometres (2.5 miles) from an army barracks.
The students were studying in grades nine and 10 while the teachers were from both primary and secondary levels.
Police Sunday said rebels had abducted around 25 teenaged schoolboys but early Monday updated the number of those kidnapped when details of the second roundup were received.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed more than 9,500 lives.

Biratnagar [east Nepal], 15 March: As the election of the constituent assembly nears, violent activities continue to disrupt the election. 
An unidentified group created terror here by planting socket bombs at BFM office and Mahendra Chowk. A team of the armed police force disposed both the bombs.

"6346",20071219,"Title: Nepalese woman who became ill on Mount Everest is safe at base camp after high altitude rescue.rtf; Date: May 25, 2007 Friday 3:35 PM GMT; Text: A woman who became seriously ill while in Mount Everest's so-called ""death zone"" and was helped down by fellow climbers has safely reached base camp, Nepalese mountaineering officials said Friday.
Uma Bista of Nepal was ""barely coherent"" and suffering from cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain, when she was found Monday at about 27,225 feet, below the summit, said veteran climber Dave Hahn of Taos, N.M.
In Internet dispatches, Hahn said he and other climbers in his group were descending from the summit of the 29,035-foot mountain when they came across Bista.
He and the others managed to carry Bista in a litter to a lower camp at 23,950 feet and handed her over to a British team, which is on the mountain on a medical research mission.
On Wednesday, aided by five Sherpas, she managed to descend the treacherous Lhotse face, a wall of glacial ice, he said.
""She walked down, she climbed down the Lhotse face. Seems like she's going to recover, and that's pretty impressive. We didn't think she'd make it. I didn't think she'd make it. We're obviously pretty happy for that,"" Hahn said his dispatch posted on greatoutdoors.com.
Krishna Bhandari of the Nepalese Mountaineering Department said Bista was ""at the base camp and safe. We are trying to arrange a helicopter to bring her back to Katmandu.""
Bhandari said officials did not have many details about her experience, and he did not know if she had been abandoned by her fellow climbers before Hahn and his group found her.
The final and most difficult part of Everest the area above 26,000 feet is nicknamed the ""death zone."" Rescues at such altitude are very difficult because of the thin air, high winds, icy slopes and exhaustion.
Climbers afflicted with high altitude cerebral edema a sudden, potentially fatal swelling of the brain display confusion, hallucinations and semiconsciousness and need to descend immediately and receive oxygen and medication.
Dozens of climbers scaled Everest in the last two weeks from the Nepalese side of the mountain. Weather conditions on the mountain had been unfavorable until last week.
The climbing season began in March and ends in late May when the annual monsoon usually brings fresh blizzards that make the climbing route too treacherous.
Since New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first conquered Everest on May 29, 1953, around 2,000 climbers have scaled the mountain. Another 205 people have died on its unpredictable slopes.

Text of report by Nepalese Kantipur Television on 6 November
[Presenter] Minister for Education Radha Krishna Mainali says the decision of major political parties to take part in the elections only after the Maoist problem was solved will only weaken multiparty democracy. Speaking at a programme organized by the Media Group-Nepal in the capital today, Minister Mainali said the decision to take part in elections only after the Maoist problem was solved was tantamount to the political parties taking the Maoists' line. And he questioned what would happen if the Maoist problem would not be resolved in the next 10 years.
[Minister Radha Krishna Mainali, recording] On the one hand they (political parties) say elections are the basis of democracy, but on the other hand they say they will not take part in the elections while the Maoist problem is not resolved. The Maoists will not easily lay down their arms and nor will they win over the state. I do not see the possibility of the Maoist problem being resolved so easily. We are not confronted with a situation where the Maoists are in a position to take over the state nor is the state in a position to resolve the Maoist problem soon. Stating that elections will only take place after the resolution of the Maoist problems is the view of the Maoists. This is only theoretical, it is not logical. We have to see things from a different perspective. The resolution of the Maoist problem can only be resolved through parliament by holding elections. Parliament is the only place where the Maoist problem can be resolved. 
[Presenter] Minister Mainali said elections would be held even if the major political parties do not participate in the elections. In reference to the media ordinance, Minister Mainali said the ordinance was not brought in to inhibit journalism but to make the media more accountable and disciplined.
Likewise, speaking at the programme leader of the RPP [Rastriya Prajatantra Party] Jog Meher Shrestha argued that the government could not stifle the people's right to information just through an ordinance. And former minister [for Women and Social Welfare] Gore Bahadur Khapange said that in the past 12 years journalism in the country had not been responsible. And he argued that the government was forced to introduce the ordinance. Khapange also accused the media of acting like the pawns of foreigners. He said following the American statement [US concerns over the possibility of the opposition parties setting up an alliance with the Maoists] political parties were rushing to participate in the elections, contrary to their initial stance of boycotting the elections.

"3848",20053178,"Title: Nepal 's royal government frees senior politician, rights activist.rtf; Date: July 4, 2005 Monday; Text: Nepal's royal government freed a senior politician, a prominent human rights activist and a student leader on Monday who were among the last political detainees in custody following King Gyanendra's seizure of power in February.
Court officials and police said there was no reason given for the release of Narhari Acharya of the Nepali Congress party, rights activist Krishna Pahadi and student leader Basu Koirala.
Acharya, a senior leader of Nepal's largest political party, was arrested immediately after the king seized absolute power on Feb. 1, while Pahadi, a leading human rights activist, was arrested a week later while protesting the royal takeover.
Koirala, general secretary of the Nepal Student Union, was arrested in March while organizing street protests banned under emergency rule.
""The situation in the country has not improved at all. We can be arrested any day again,"" Pahadi said after his release.
""We will continue our struggle for human rights and peace,"" he said.
Hundreds of politicians and activists were arrested following the takeover. However, international pressure and orders from the Supreme Court forced the government to release many in recent weeks.
Shobhakar Parajuli, a spokesman for the Nepali Congress, said all political detainees from the seven major political parties - which have organized street protests against the king's direct rule - have now been freed.
Mahesh Acharya, a senior Nepali Congress member, said the king was not easing his grip on power.
""The government decision to free them has no political significance. They were going to freed by the court soon,"" he said.
The king has said he took control because of an escalating communist insurgency and widespread state corruption.
Earlier Monday, officials said Nepalese troops fought communist rebels in an all-night gunbattle after the guerillas attacked a remote police post in the country's east, wounding two policemen.
The rebels attacked the police station in Diktel, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Katmandu, around midnight Saturday, triggering a fierce gunbattle with troops, local police chief Iswori Chapagai said Monday.
The fighting ended early Sunday after more troops arrived, he said. The town is only accessible by helicopter.
Soldiers were searching for the attackers Monday, but bad weather was making it difficult.
Rebel violence has escalated since the king took complete power.
The nine-year insurgency has left more than 11,500 dead.

""Early voter turnout seems to be quite heavy,"" Kieran Dwyer, the spokesman for the United Nations Mission in Nepal, told AFP.
""We are receiving reports, not confirmed by us in all cases, of some incidents involving violence in some parts of the country, but at the same time voting appears to be going smoothly in many, many parts of Nepal,"" he added.
Police and officials said voting had come to a halt in just a handful of around 21,000 polling booths -- an encouraging sign given earlier fears that violence would wreck the election.
In the west of the country, Maoist supporters burned down a polling booth, officials said, adding that 15 of them were arrested with three grenades.
Other unrest reported by police in various parts of the country included clashes between activists from other parties, the theft of ballot papers from one station and a small bomb.
There have so far been no reports of any deaths or injuries.
Security was tight across the Himalayan nation, following a string of killings and bombings as well as reports of widespread voter intimidation in the final days of campaigning.
Thursday's polls are the climax of a 2006 peace deal between Nepal's former rebel Maoists and mainstream political parties and will elect a body that will abolish the monarchy and rewrite the constitution.

 Following the warning by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, the Maoists have expressed commitment in writing that they would not interfere with freedom of the press and expression. But the situation is such that the Maoists have reneged on their previous commitments.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13 Sep 04 p 6
Earlier Chairman of the Maoist party Prachanda had said that the Maoists would not kill any political party cadre in the name of spying, but his commitment was never implemented. The commitment expressed after the murder of journalist Gyanendra Khadka was not implement and once again Dekendra Raj Khadka was murdered. The Maoists have warned many journalists that their fate will be the same as that of Dekendra. Though belated, the Maoist leadership decided to honour the professional demands of the press and it should be seen in a positive light. But only full implementation will translate the Maoists' commitment into reality.  passage omitted: The Maoists should free the abducted journalists Dhan Bahadur Rokka and Kul Bahadur Malla and ensure that they are true to their commitment.

"2507",20043255,"Title: Watchdog's warning, protests put focus on South Asia for world rights day.rtf; Date: December 10, 2004 Friday 11:14 AM GMT; Text: A watchdog warned Friday of increasing threats to rights across South Asia as protestors marked International Human Rights Day with marches against alleged abuse in Kashmir and Tibet.
In Srinagar, Muslim separatists as well as rights activists staged marches against alleged abuses by Indian troops.
For the first time since the 1989 start of a Muslim insurgency against Indian rule, Kashmir's biggest and pro-India party, the National Conference, demonstrated against rights violations.
""Down with state terrorism"", more than 100 activists chanted. ""We want (an) end to human rights violations.""
A dozen separatists were detained as they set out on their own protest, witnesses said. Police also dispersed dozens of activists from the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) who also tried to march in the city.
Hundreds of Tibetans held a silent protest march in New Delhi to mark the  day and demanded the release of a Tibetan monk awaiting execution in China.
Protestors carried banners and wore black bands across their faces which read: ""Save Tibet,"" ""China, get out of Tibet"".
""On this day when the world and the United Nations adopted the human rights charter, we are taking to the streets to celebrate human rights and to ask the UN to intervene in the violation of human rights in Tibet,"" said Dolma Gyari, vice chairman of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile headquartered in the north Indian hill district of Dharamshala.
The Asian Human Rights Commission offered a bleak outlook saying many South Asians lived in fear as basic rights come under increasing threat.
A breakdown in the rule of law was seen as a key factor fuelling rights abuses, including forced disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrests, the Hong Kong-based watchdog said.
""The state of human rights in most countries of Asia is very bleak,"" a statement said. ""Without serious efforts to defend these principles, life in a great many parts of the region will rapidly grow dramatically worse.""
It noted a growing problem of ""disappearances"" and singled out Nepal as the worst case. Government forces are battling a leftist uprising in the country. 
""Over 1,400 persons are known to have disappeared there (last year), and a much larger number are believed to have suffered the same fate, but without any records attesting to their loss.""
The statement noted police were often part of the problem.
""The greatest obstacle to the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the region is the police,"" it said. ""In most countries of Asia, the police are perceived not as law-enforcers but as law-breakers. Police impede respect for human rights, and precipitate breakdowns in law and order.""
The commission said parliaments were either powerless or lacked the will to improve the rights situation.
South Asia is home to more than 1.2 billion people and is regarded as the world's poorest region.
In Sri Lanka, notorious for the disappearances of tens of thousands of people since the early 1970s, the criminal justice system had collapsed, the commission said.
""Even Sri Lankan judges themselves are not safe to discharge their duties in accordance with the law, and in fact are all but encouraged to disregard it,"" the commission charged.
However, President Chandrika Kumaratunga said Friday she had begun rebuilding a ""tattered society and re-establishing civil liberties to prove to the international community that Sri Lanka is a country of civilised people.""
Colombo had improved its rights record considerably in the past 10 years, she said, but still needed to work out a lasting solution to the island's ethnic conflict which has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
In India, the commission blamed ineffective administration of justice, particularly delays in court procedures, for a deteriorating rights record.
Corruption in the legal and judicial systems, and discrimination based on caste and social status are also leading to rights violations in India, it said.
""The judiciary wrings its hands over the faltering rule of law, but nothing more is done to bring about change,"" the commission said, urging New Delhi to ratify international treaties against custodial torture.

Excerpt from report by privately-owned Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 3 November
[Report by Lila Ballav Ghimire]
Biratnagar, 2 November: The posts of secretary have been vacant in 30 village development committees in Bhojpur [district in eastern Nepal] since the past year and half. In Morang [another district in eastern Nepal], however, there are five more secretaries than the number of village development committees. [passage omitted]
Of the 63 village development committees in Bhojpur, 30 have been without secretaries for the past year and a half, according to local development officer Gabindra Karki. While 33 village development committee secretaries are on duty, more than half of these have been operating out of district headquarters on various excuses. 
""Only half the posts have incumbents, and with these also remaining confined to district headquarters on one excuse or the other the business of the public has been obstructed,"" he said. The Public Service Commission has been contacted time and again to get the vacant posts filled, but to no avail, he said.
In Morang District, however, there are 70 village development committee secretaries at work although the district has only 65 village development committees. This situation has arisen as officials designated for remote posts have used their connections to be allowed to remain at district headquarters, a source said. 
""Before this there used to be an even bigger excess of secretaries, but now it's only five,"" planning officer Ganesh Dahal said. In Morang also, more than half the secretaries have remained confined to district headquarters. They say they cannot go to the villages of their posting because of threats from armed groups in the Terai [southern plains]. 
Of the 3,915 posts of village development secretary throughout the country, 408 are vacant, the Ministry of Local Development has stated. [passage omitted]

In a statement sent to news organizations on Wednesday, Prachanda - the rebel leader whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal - said his rebel group had decided to cease all offensive actions and join peace talks.
But the rebel statement comes just days after the chief of Nepal's Armed Police Force, his wife and a body guard were killed in an attack police have blamed on the rebels.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began a violent campaign in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state in this Himalayan kingdom.
Clashes between government forces and rebels have intensified in recent months, with the army joining the police in a campaign to root out Maoist fighters from strongholds in remote mountainous areas.
King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency in November 2001 after the rebels broke a cease-fire and resumed attacks on government troops. The emergency was lifted last year but the fighting continues.
The insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people.

The abductions occurred at the weekend when rebels went from village to village in the Achham district rounding up males and females aged between 15 and 25 years, a village development committee (VDC) chief said.
The youths have been taken to undisclosed rebel bases in remote parts of Achham and surrounding districts, he said.
The captives have been divided into five platoons, each comprising 200 youths, who will be trained separately, said the chief, who did want to be identified.
A few weeks ago, Maoist rebels in the area had issued notices ordering youths to join the rebel army but none had complied willingly.
The human rights group the Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC) condemned the abductions and called on the rebels to release their captives immediately and abide by international human rights conventions.
Maoist rebels have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarch and establish a communist republic. The insurgency has so far claimed more than 9,500 lives.

"6076",2007868,"Title: Opportunity for positive engagement.rtf; Date: January 7, 2007 Sunday 2:51 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Jan 7 -- In the movie Kabul Express an avuncular Taliban-type proudly rattles off names of Bollywood superstars to a couple of Indian journalists, in war torn Afghanistan. King Khan and Big B might be cross-border stars, but India is often cast as the regional villain in the South Asian saga of suspicion and discord.
  Sharing land or maritime borders with eight different nations, most of which do not share one with each other has made India a convenient punching bag for regional angst. Add to this, our patchy response to the travails of our smaller neighbours and you might believe the brickbats are well deserved. The last few years have seen a maturing of political processes in the region, based on the assertion of separate political identities.
  Strong ethnic, linguistic and cultural linkages often drag India into internal conflicts and political tugs of war. This has prompted controversial Indian interventions in the past, some of which like the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 and peacekeeping operations in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s have tempered Indian mediation. India has also been attempting to break out of the regional straitjacket by seeking a larger international role. Not only has this vacated space for other countries to influence the politics of the region, ironically, India has been dragged even deeper into the internal politics of neighbouring states. But the winds of change sweeping across the subcontinent, pointing to new political formations, provide a fresh opportunity for constructive regional engagement.
  Bangladesh will hold national elections later this month, despite the electoral boycott by the 19-member alliance led by Awami League. In Nepal, with the curtains coming down on the monarchy, the Maoists are poised to join the government, changing the face of Nepalese politics. With the resumption of hostilities in Sri Lanka's civil war, political rivals are burying differences to deal with a resurgent LTTE. There's a new King in Bhutan, discontent is brewing against 30 years of uninterrupted Gayoom rule in the Maldives, and the voices for democracy in Myanmar are growing louder.
  Despite some positive political changes in the neighbourhood, outstanding border disputes and mutual suspicion have prevented meaningful regional cooperation. In South Asia, the insecurities of its states are more closely linked than in any other part of the world. Illegal migration across the India-Bangladesh border creates as much havoc as it does on the Pakistan-Afghanistan or Nepal-Bhutan border; religious fanaticism is threatening Bangladesh as much as it is Pakistan or India, AIDS does not respect national boundaries and smuggled small weapons kill thousands of South Asians every year.
  India is hosting the next SAARC summit in April. This provides a good opportunity to revive defunct conventions on trafficking, narcotics and terrorism, and moot regional mechanisms for addressing common concerns. SAARC's vision of regional integration is based on the premise that shared borders can create common opportunities and platforms for collaboration. As successful regional integration in Southeast Asia and Europe show, collaboration on shared concerns can also alleviate discord. In the words of our PM, ""we can choose our friends but we cannot choose our neighbours."" Economics has triumphed over politics in redifining our relations with countries like the US. It is time now to apply the same logic within the regional context.

 Edirne/Aydin: 24 May: Turkish security forces have captured 157 illegal immigrants in northwestern province of Edirne over the last two days, sources said on Monday 24 May .
 Sources noted that gendarme forces caught 157 foreigners of Indian, Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Iranian, Tunisian and Nepalese origin who attempted to pass border illegally in Meric and Enez towns of the province.
Anatolia news agency, Ankara, in English 1456 gmt 24 Apr 04
They will be deported following legal proceedings. Turkey is a route of illegal migration due to its geographical location lying between Asia and Europe like a bridge with its rough mountainous eastern and southeastern borders difficult to control. Illegal immigrants from Middle Eastern, Asian and Far Eastern countries generally use this route or to sneak into European countries.
 In the West, northwestern Edirne province and some other Aegean provinces are routes for illegal immigrants to cross the border. Particularly Meric River, a natural border between Turkey and Greece, and Aegean provinces which are close to Greek Islands in the Aegean Sea are used by illegal immigrants to go to European countries.
 In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of illegal immigrants who were caught by the Turkish security forces who stepped up security measures against illegal migration.
 Security forces have intercepted 49 illegal immigrants in Didim town of western province of Aydin in the last two days as they were trying to proceed to Greece illegally. The immigrants of Somalian and Iraqi origin were taken into custody for violating Turkish borders and passport law. They will be deported once the legal proceedings are completed.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 1 June
Pokhara, [Sunday] 1 June: Martin Howe, the British lawyer who will plead the case of former British Gurkha soldiers against the British government, said here on Saturday that though these soldiers had served Britain faithfully, they were being discriminated against.
Speaking during a programme of the western zone chapter of the British Ex-Gurkhas' Association, Howe said he and his group of seven associates would fight the British ex-Gurkhas' legal battle to the finish. He said only those soldiers retiring after 1997 were allowed residence facility in Britain.
Howe said the number of ex-Gurkhas who were denied visas to Britain was more than 2,000. Some 15 of these soldiers are fighting a legal case in British courts. The hearing in their case will start on 21 July and continue for four days, said Howe, adding that Gyanendra Rai, who fought for Britain in the Falklands, was sent home packing empty-handed. Rai's case is also in court in Britain.
Howe said seven more British lawyers would arrive here to take up the case of these soldiers. He and his associates will interview aggrieved soldiers, those lying sick or incapacitated and also talk to the widows and dependents of dead soldiers. Though the British government hiked the pay of ex-British Gurkhas by 21 per cent some time back with retrospective effect, they have not got the money yet.
Howe said they would ask the British Defence Ministry to clarify why the money had not been paid. ""In the event of unsatisfactory replies, we would file a case on behalf of ex-Gurkhas' widows.""
Howe and his associates will begin a formal interaction with these soldiers and widows of the dead soldiers from Monday. 
Speaking in on Saturday's interaction, central president of the association Padam Bahadur Gurung said: ""In court, we will ask Britain to provide free medicare to association members.""
Around 45,000 Gurkha soldiers have laid down their lives fighting for Britain. The number of those injured in action exceeds 150,000.

    The total number of rhinos killed or died in 2006 must be  around 47. One cannot even imagine that such an endangered species is being poached so rampantly. If rhino-poaching continues at this rate, no rhinos will be left in Nepal in the next 10-20 years,""  the daily quoted Mangal Man Shakya, chairman of the Wildlife Watch Group, as saying.
    According to data made available by different conservation  agencies, 29 to 47 rhinos were poached or died in 2006. 
    Nepal was home to over 800 rhinos until 1950, but the number  went down to only 60 in 1960s. Thanks to the government's  conservation efforts and international support, the rhino  population increased by 2000.
    According to the statistics of rhino count, Nepal sheltered 544 rhinos in 2000 but only 372 were left in 2005.
    One kg of rhino horn costs 3.5 million Nepali rupees (50,000 U. S. dollars) in international illegal trade market. 
    ""And if the number of rhinos can go down by half in mere six or seven years, how many years will it take for the rhinos to become  extinct here?"" Shakya said.
    Anil Manandhar, country representative of the World Wildlife  Fund, said that the rising poaching incidents in 2006 are indeed a lesson for conservationists. 
    ""Rather than working on paper, time has come for the  conservationists to focus on actions aimed at conserving  rhinoceros,"" he said.

 Kathmandu, 25 May: India has decided to give the Royal Nepalese Army RNA a short take-off aeroplane, two military helicopters and more equipment. Southern neighbour India has been a major help in the war against Maoists.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 26 May 04 p1
A decision to this effect was reached between the Indian army and the RNA during a meeting in the capital in the first week of May. During the two-day meeting, the security officials informed the Indian army about their need for equipment.
 According to a source, the Indian security officials promised to give a short take-off aeroplane, two military helicopters (gunships), motor vehicles, military equipment and an extra ""training package"".
 The officials also pledged to give INSAS Indian Small Arms System rifles that are being used by Nepalese soldiers for personal use, communications equipment, mine and night vision devices, among other things. Likewise, an agreement was reached between the two sides on additional training to combat terrorism.
 However, director of the RNA's public relations office Brig-Gen Rajendra Thapa did not confirm the report. America, India and Britain have increased assistance to the RNA since the start of military deployment against the Maoists. India has already given four helicopters, 13,000 INSAS rifles and motor vehicles.
 According to the information received, 10,000 more INSAS rifles will arrive. The RNA is seeking light and modern rifles, hand radio sets, light bulletproof jackets, personal weapons such as hand grenades, rocket launchers, LMG light machine guns , surveillance and night vision devices.
 The RNA officials said that the two aircraft promised by Britain will come within two weeks. Security officers who will be using the planes, have already gone for training. There is an agreement on purchasing a Skytruck with Poland as well.

""The operators are losing around Rs 160 million every month,"" informed officials at the Public Account Committee (PAC) of the Legislature-Parliament here today.
""Illegal VOIP channels are not only eating up huge amount of revenue but also posing serious security threats,"" said Rajendra Singh Bhandari, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Nepal Police and head of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB). ""Illegal VOIP channels account for calls worth two million minutes, resulting in massive loss of revenue,"" he said.
""Earlier, criminals used VOIP channels in media-baron Jamim Shah's murder and Dr Bhaktaman Shrestha's abduction,"" he said, adding that the investigations revealed that VOIP devices were imported from Bangladesh.
Police action has significantly brought down the number of illegal operators, he said, informing the committee that the number of illegal VOIP operators has come down to only four-five from 165 in the past.
Jay Mukunda Khanal, joint-secretary of the Home Ministry informed that 33 racketeers - nine Bangladeshi and 24 Nepalis - have been brought to book by the ministry so far. ""VOIP poses a threat of organised crime along with revenue loss and other criminal acts,"" he said, adding that rampant and indiscreet distribution of SIM cards by telecom service providers has also aggravated the problem of controlling crime.
Illegal VOIP operators are liable to face legal actions under Article 47 of Nepal Doorsanchar Act 1997, which says misusing or doing anything harmful to the telecom system, to its structures, or to its equipment with malicious intent is a crime punishable with a fine equal to the amount claimed for harm caused or five years in jail or both.
NTA has also formulated a policy regarding bandwidth distribution, according to the regulatory authority of the telecom service operators.
The authority has awarded four companies - Nepal Telecom (NT), United Telecom (UT), Spice Nepal Pvt Ltd and ATS Telecom - to operate VOIP service in Nepal, according to Sushil Ghimire, secretary at the Ministry of Information and Communication (MoIC).
Bhesh Raj Kanel, chairman of Nepal Telecom Authority (NTA), said that the authority has asked for the details from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) regarding the bandwidth users of 1 Mbps or more than that.
However, PAC has asked them to appear on January 13 with details of revenue paid by all telecom operators and their dues.
The revenue
KATHMANDU: According to the data provided by NTA, the regulatory authority has collected Rs 81.16 million from telecom service providers in 2009-10. Of this, UTL has paid Rs 6.19 million; Spice Nepal paid Rs 70.64 million and Nepal Satellite paid Rs 4.32 million. STM Telecom and Smart Telecom are not liable to pay any revenue for certain period under government's Rural Telecom Service (RTS) programme.

 Kathmandu, April 21 -- Bowing to the all-round pressure, Nepal's King Gyanendra on Friday announced to hand over the executive power to the Seven Party Opposition alliances and asked them to name the new Prime Minister.
  The monarch's announcement made in a televised address, comes just a day after the Indian Prime Minister's special envoy, Karan Singh, met the King at his Narayanhiti Palace and stressed on the need for the restoration of democracy as early as possible.
  In the new set up announced, the monarch is expected to have a titular role on the lines of the proposed Nepal formula envisaged by the Indian Government.
  King Gyanendra in his address said: ""We are committed to multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy"", adding, ""Executive power of the kingdom of Nepal, which was in our safekeeping, shall from this day be returned to the people"".
  King Gyanendra, who emphasized on holding the elections as early as possible, said that the present Council of Ministers would continue to function till the new Council was not formed.
  Expressing the hope that the revival of the multi-party democracy would help in restoration of peace in the Himalayan kingdom, the King said that his country do not have any space for terrorism, in an indirect reference to the Maoist.
  Today's announcement comes on the 16th day of protests marked by violence as tens of thousands of people demonstrated on the streets of Kathmandu in spite of shoot-on-sight curfew orders, demanding the immediate restoration of multi-party democracy.
  On February 1, 2005, the Nepalese monarch had sacked the incumbent government and took over the reins of the power with a ceremonial Council of Ministers in place handpicked by the King himself.
  Meanwhile, the initial reactions in Kathmandu were positive as people cheered.
  However, the political parties were sceptic to the proposal and said that only after a face-to-face meeting with the King they could say something about the proposal.
  The Seven Party Alliances expressed unhappiness that the King's announcement did not mention about constituting a new Constituent Assembly.
  Communist Party of Nepal -Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), on the other hand, rejected the proposal offered by the King, saying ""our demand for the formation of the new Constituent Assembly has not yet been fulfilled"".
  The Nepali Congress said that it is not clear who would be named as the Prime Minister and demanded that Maoists too should be included and that the protests would continue since our demands are yet to be fulfilled.
  The curfew clamped in the Kathmandu continues and has been extended till midnight.

Damak [eastern Nepal], 15 October: The Maoists in Jhapa [District] have been pressuring the security personnel in police stations that reopened after the conflict subsided to abandon the stations.
The District Police Office [DPO] Jhapa has restored two area police offices and half a dozen police stations that were earlier displaced by the Maoist insurgency. The chief of Jhapa DPO, Yogendra Katuwal, said the abandoned police stations were restored as the atmosphere of peace gradually returned but now the Maoists have continuously been pressuring and issuing threats and it has become difficult to operate those police stations.
A policeman based at a restored police station said Maoist workers come to the police station frequently and pressure them to abandon the station. [passage omitted] 
""The Maoists recently ordered vacating of the restored Budhabare police station by 6 p.m. on 18 October,"" a senior security official told Nepal Samacharpatra, adding ""we have been facing such threats for a long time"".
The official said the police stations in Sanischare and Birtagazaar among others have also been facing such threats.
The Maoists' policy, meanwhile, is to set up their camps in such police stations after chasing away the security personnel. The rebels have already installed their armed troops in Surunga and Jyamirgadhi police stations after chasing away the security personnel there. The rebels have also been seizing control of sub-customs offices.
Police officials say they are helpless because of the ongoing peace talks at the central level. ""We cannot take any action without orders from the central level,"" DPO chief Katuwal said.

Around 19,000 former fighters -- including 3,000 underage combatants -- have been in UN-monitored camps since a 2006 peace deal that ended the Maoists' bloody ""people's war.""
UN agencies must have access to the children to ensure their ""recovery and reintegration,"" Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, said.
""The promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children,"" she said.
Nepal's Maoists, whose leader Prachanda was sworn in as prime minister last week, said they had yet to decide what to do with the 2,973 underage fighters, who were all under 18 in May 2006.
""We cannot chase them away just like that. They were helpful during the 'people's war' and now we cannot just ditch them,"" senior Maoist Chandra Prakash Gajurel told AFP.
Despite winning polls in April and having their leader become prime minister, the Maoists have not tackled the issue of the fighters, who battled Nepal's security forces for a decade.
The former rebels -- whose decade-long civil war killed at least 13,000 people -- say the fighters should be integrated into the Nepalese army.
But the army has said that there is no place in its ranks for politically indoctrinated guerrillas.

"5214",20061320,"Title: Beyond the Brussels blitz.rtf; Date: November 18, 2006 Saturday 11:17 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Nov 18 -- Being inheritors to a historic heritage is both empowering and humbling. It is empowering because of the remarkably old roots of our nation's composite character. It is humbling because of the enormous responsibility it places on us to preserve it and make it accessible to others.""
  What did Sonia Gandhi mean when she used these words to inaugurate the 'Tejas' exhibition in Brussels on November 19? Was she articulating a polite platitude? Or did she allude to the real condition of our heritage, obscured when it is aggressively marketed in cultural festivals abroad? Was she aware that the exhibition which she inaugurated at Palais de Beaux Arts, forms part of a heritage which is neither preserved properly nor widely accessible?
  The exhibited objects range from early Indian sculptures to rare Kangra paintings. Handpicked from Indian museums, these are being displayed together for the first time.
  And certainly, as Sonia Gandhi put it, the exhibition is making them accessible to 'others' - those who live in Brussels or are privileged enough to visit it. The exhibition, though, will not be accessible to India's 'own'.
  Indian bigwigs who choreograph cultural festivals do not usually ensure that such exhibitions travel across India once they return home. 'Others' are evidently more equal than 'us' in their access to cultural treasures of this kind.
  'Tejas', for the Congress president, profiles the radiance and energy of India's civilisational journey over fifteen hundred years. But again, she, like most of
  India, is hardly likely to know that much of this 'radiance' doesn't see the light of day. Its effulgence remains locked up in dark museum vaults. The Indian Museum in Kolkata has 1,165 collections on display while those that lie locked up number more than 25,000. In the National Museum in Delhi, just about 8 to 10 per cent of its vast collection is on display.
  Art objects, of course, are supposed to be safe in reserve collections, even if they remain unseen. Actually, about that too, there isn't any unanimity. Because of an international traffic in illicit art objects, theft of art and archaeological treasures from protected sites and museums has escalated.
  In India, between 1977 and 1979, 3,000 thefts of antiquities were reported. Only ten cases were solved, it requires very little imagination to realise that much of what could not be traced was smuggled out and sold. These are only reported thefts. The UNESCO in that decade (1979 to 1989) estimated that more than 50,000 objects had been smuggled out of India.
  Remote localities are especially vulnerable but so are well-policed premises. Most recently, there have been thefts in the Patna Museum and in the Indian Museum, while the Rashtrapati Bhavan estate itself saw a bizarre robbery a little less than ten years ago.
  This was in 1997, when one third of the artifacts housed in its museum were looted. When the case was solved some weeks later, part of the loot had already been destroyed - the kilos of melted silver and broken antiques that were recovered suggested this. Amazing though it may sound, the main accused who had scaled the Rashtrapati Bhavan walls, was a rag picker!
  Despoiling museums and monuments is not something that rag pickers usually do.
  Art thieves are generally well heeled characters, several of them have attained high rank and office. The French have had a specially notorious record on this front, if one remembers the case of Andre Malraux who later became the French Minister of Cultural Affairs. Malraux was charged with stealing some stones and bas-reliefs from the temple of Bantea Srei in Cambodia while entrusted with an expedition to study Khmer architecture. 'Some stones' is an understatement,
  he actually destroyed the unity of Bantea Srei by removing almost a ton of material. The sentence of three years' imprisonment was later reduced, but it highlighted the impunity with which government permits are misused to steal material. Malraux has contemporary clones, many diplomats are known to have (mis)used the immunity from search usually given to diplomatic bags, for this purpose.
  Where does this lead us? Simply to the conclusion that certificates of admiration that our heritage earns in cultural festivals abroad mean very little.
  In real terms, the challenge is how India which is so self-congratulatory about its soft power, uses its position as a global player to safeguard it. Certainly, she can learn from the approaches and endeavours of other global players who also happen be archaeologically rich countries.
  To begin with, there should be a 'cultural census'. There are inventories of African objects outside Africa and Oceanic objects in Australian, European and American museums. Do we have inventories of Indian objects in museums abroad? Do we even have inventories of the distribution of objects from one site across India?
  These may take time to complete, but cul"

Official radio said the freed prisoners were mostly smugglers or other common criminals.
In central Kathmandu, tens of thousands of well-wishers, many of them young people, soldiers or police officers, queued at the main palace to present flowers for the king's birthday.
Official celebrations will be held through Wednesday for the birthday of the king, who is revered by Nepalese traditionalists as an incarnation of the Hindu deity Bishnu.
July 7 is a national holiday in Nepal, with public buildings decorated in lights to mark the king's birthday.
State radio said Gyanendra was sent messages wishing him a long and happy life from heads of state around the world, including US President George W. Bush, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, Indian President Abdul Kalam and Chinese President Hu Jintao, along with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
At 57, Gyanendra is the oldest king of the Shah dynasty since its consolidation of Nepal as a kingdom in the mid-18th century.
Gyanendra's elder brother, Birendra, died at age 55 after three decades on the throne in a June 2001 massacre at the royal palace carried out by the crown prince, Dipendra. An official inquiry said Dipendra was drunk and incensed that his parents objected to his desired fiancee.
Dipendra, who turned the gun on himself, was declared king while he was in a coma but died within days, leaving Gyanendra as the 13th Shah king.
Gyanendra's rule has come at a critical time in Nepal, with thousands killed in a Maoist insurgency and royal intervention in the democratic process.
The kingdom has been mostly at peace since January, when the Maoists reached a ceasefire with the royal-appointed government.
However, Nepal has been seeing the most open protests against the monarchy since Birendra restored democracy in 1990, with parties infuriated that Gyanendra dismissed the elected government in October 2002.
The political parties did not hold protests on the king's birthday.

 Gautam at the same time urged the political parties to express commitment not to repeat the mistakes they committed in the past. According to him, political parties must now convince the people that they are able to ensure good governance.
 First step towards this, according to him, would be to sign a code of conduct outlining their commitments.

At least 445 people have been killed and millions have been affected in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan since the monsoon season began in mid-June.
Aid workers said 33 more people died in Pakistan, most in the southern Sindh province, as monsoon rains damaged hundreds of homes and ruptured a small dam.
Flash floods hit the western Indian desert state of Rajasthan after years of drought. Five children were washed away overnight when a flash flood engulfed a village and two other children drowned in a reservoir, Press Trust of India reported.
Four adults also died, including two women who were struck by lightning, police Supt. Govind Gupta was quoted as saying by PTI.
Two people drowned Thursday night in the Samastipur area of India's eastern Bihar state, local police said. All the major rivers in the state were flowing at dangerous levels, officials said.
Hundreds of thousands of people were affected across the state, police and government officials said. Homes and roads have been submerged, cattle have drowned, and people driven from their villages to higher ground.
Floodwaters have damaged or washed away thousands of flimsy huts and sections of mud levees along river banks. Surging waters have also drowned livestock, swamped rice fields, submerged roads and rail tracks, disrupting communications.
Two people died in northeastern Assam state, where the floods have affected 4.7 million people and killed 22 since last month in more than 4,600 villages, a flood relief official said on condition of anonymity. A 25-year-old man and 17-year-old girl were killed when their boat capsized in a whirlpool at the village of Charbori in Assam.
Boats are the only means of communication and transportation for villagers in far-flung, submerged areas during the annual monsoons, he said.
Flooding and landslides from heavy rains have stranded about 7 million people in South Asia since mid-June, relief officials said.

""We think the Maoist statement is a positive sign, but some clarifications are needed to create an atmosphere of mutual trust,"" said Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal.
He added that the rebels should first lay down their arms, ending a conflict that has claimed about 12,000 lives since 1996 in the Himalayan kingdom.
""To prove their sincerity and genuine desire for talks, the Maoists should make a formal announcement (on giving up their arms) from their party's plenum,"" Nepal told AFP.
On Monday, Maoist chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda (""The Fierce""), called for talks with an alliance of seven political parties working to restore democracy in Nepal after February's royal takeover of power.
Prachanda in a statement urged the seven parties ""to form without delay its authoritative team that can hold talks ... to find a democratic way out of the current intricate political situation"".
The Maoist move coincided with a visit to Nepal by Lakhdar Brahimi, special adviser to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
""We are ready to hold talks with anyone in this world, including the United Nations, for the cause of democracy, peace and progress as desired by the Nepalese people,"" said Prachanda.
UN officials were tight-lipped on whether a meeting was on the cards between Brahimi and Prachanda or with other senior Maoists.
The seven parties formed an alliance to organize protests after King Gyanendra sacked a four-party coalition government and seized power to tackle the Maoist insurgency.
Nepal said, ""the seven parties have not yet decided on the call of Prachanda, but we are going to meet soon to discuss the possible formation of a committee to hold talks with them"".
Brahimi did meet with leading political figures in Kathmandu on Tuesday including former Nepal premier Girija Prasad Koirala, who called for help from the international community.
""The present crisis should be resolved with the help of international communities including India,"" Koirali said after the meeting.
""If the Maoist problem cannot be resolved through military solution, the    parties should move ahead by taking initiative to solve it,"" he said. ""The political parties need the international cooperation and support.""
Political analyst Lok Raj Baral said Prachanda's call followed a recent New Delhi meeting between senior Maoist leaders and some of the Nepalese political leaders.
""If the Maoists are sincere in their offer, then it is highly significant as (it would mean) the seven party leaders and the Maoists would hold direct talks and bypass the king,"" Baral said.
Gyanendra, when he took over on February 1, appealed to the Maoists to join the political mainstream and end their armed rebellion.
But Prachandra at the time denounced the monarch as a ""national betrayer"" and said efforts would be stepped up to oust the monarchy.
""If the current crisis and the Maoists problem could be solved through (this) initiative ... it would be a great achievement,"" Baral said.
""If the seven parties can convince the Maoists to lay down arms and work for the multi-party system, then it would be their biggest victory.""
Baral added that street protests staged regularly by the political parties would not be enough to persuade the king to give up the power he seized more than five months ago.
At the same time, he added, if the rebels could persuade the parties to agree to constituent assembly elections without making a formal ceasefire declaration, it would be seen as a great victory for the Maoists.
Nepali Congress senior leader and former deputy premier Ram Chandra Paudel was another leader urging caution about the Maoist offer.
""We hope the Maoist offer is genuine and that they are sincere in their commitment,"" he said. ""Before jumping into the dragnet of Prachanda, we must know exactly what they want from us.
""Let's not fall into a Maoist political trap or be involved in their movement for a republic system without (making) them lay down their arms.""
The speaker of the dissolved House of Representatives, Taranath Ranabhat, said: ""I don't think it would be easy to solve the current crisis by sitting together with the Maoists unless they make a pledge to give up their arms.""

KATMANDU, Nepal -- Nineteen people, including three Americans, died in a plane crash in Nepal on Sunday as they headed back to the capital, Katmandu, after a sightseeing tour of the mountains, including Mount Everest, officials said.
The 3-member crew died in the crash of the Buddha Air flight, as did 10 Indian citizens, 2 Nepalis and a Japanese citizen, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal at the Tribhuvan International Airport, which is not far from the crash site.
A spokeswoman for the United States Embassy, Heather Steil, said the embassy was in touch with Nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the Americans on board. ''Consular officials will reach out the families of the victims and offer whatever service we can provide,'' she said.
According to Rishikesh Sharma, a senior official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the plane lost contact with the Tribhuvan airport 42 minutes after taking off.
Raj K.C., a witness, told Kantipur Television that the plane was flying low amid thick fog in the skies above Badegaun, a few miles from the airport.
''I heard the plane exploding and saw fire as he crashed on the land,'' he said.
Television channels showed the debris of the plane scattered at the crash site.
Nepal's government announced an investigation into the cause of the crash a few hours after the accident. The flight passenger list and hotel records showed that the Indian citizens were traveling in a group.

The casualties were the result of waterborne diseases, electrocution, building collapses and drownings since the torrential rains began in mid-June across India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.
The annual monsoon rains combined with melting snow fill rivers to overflowing with the water flooding land for miles. Houses, schools, railroads and roads have been inundated.
Despite the devastation, the region's residents eagerly await the rains, which guarantee fruitful crops.
With more rain forecast over the next few days in Bangladesh and India's northeast, the flooding was likely to worsen, relief officials said. The rains usually end in September.
In India's eastern Bihar state, some 20 trains were halted after floods washed away a rail line Monday, while authorities in northeastern Assam state asked the Red Cross for help to reach relief to stranded villagers.
Tarum Gogoi, the top elected official in Assam state said officials asked the Red Cross for food, clothes, tents, drinking water and mosquito nets to help more than 2 million victims in 18 of the state's 24 districts. They have also requested doctors, nurses, and medicine.
Floods have killed at least 39 people in Assam, including a family of four who drowned after their boat capsized in flood waters Monday while moving to higher ground in a village 170 miles northeast of the state capital, Gauhati.
Because of the distances and the washed-out communications links, reports take a day or longer to reach state capitals.
The rushing rivers have led to some acts of desperation.
In Bihar, residents of hamlets on opposite banks of a flooded river exchanged gunshots to prevent one other from slicing off chunks of an embankment and thereby diverting the water to the other side, a local administrator told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
No one was injured in the weekend clash in East Champaran district, 80 miles north of the Bihar capital. On Tuesday, four new deaths were reported from the state, pushing the death toll there to 62.
Monsoon rains have also ravaged other parts of the country, claiming 45 lives in southern Kerala state and 17 in northern Uttar Pradesh state. A total of 166 flood-related deaths have been reported in India.
In neighboring Bangladesh, the rains have engulfed 25 of its 64 districts since late last month, stranding more than 3 million people in their flooded homes and killing 54.
The rain-swollen Jamuna River rose out of its banks Tuesday, flooding 40 villages and killing five people, including a mother and her young son in northern Sirajganj district.
Five other people drowned in the northeastern Sylhet and Sunamganj districts where the Surma River overflowed its banks. Elsewhere in the country's north eight other people - mostly children - drowned Monday.
Weather officials in Dhaka, the national capital, said the flooding would likely worsen as heavy rains continue and flood waters from neighboring India flow into Bangladesh.
Bangladesh sits in the basins of the region's largest rivers, the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Jamuna, which originate in the Himalayas and run through India before draining into the Bay of Bengal.
In Pakistan, five people were killed by collapsing homes or roofs in Mardan district in the country's northwest. About 50 others were injured late Sunday in several villages in Mardan, 75 miles northwest of the capital, Islamabad.
Rescue workers made the most of improving weather in Nepal and rushed emergency supplies to thousands of people left homeless by monsoon flooding in the country's south, where 47 people have died in the disaster.

 Salyan, 21 June: The Maoists have said that they would permit only five types of NGOs to work in their stronghold. The NGOs are demoralized because the rebels have asked them for separate registration with them.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Jun 05, p 1
The Magarat autonomous regional government of Rukum, Rolpa and Salyan districts [mid-west Nepal] has permitted NGOs to work in road, irrigation, electricity, education and health sectors only. The Maoists have said that the organizations will not be allowed to work in other areas than these.
 ""Even education and health sectors are under their consideration,"" said Dilli Binadi, project officer of Save the Children Norway. He said that the rebels have been pressuring him to register the organization to the Maoists.
 ""They have not stopped the projects totally but they are exerting constant pressure to register with them,"" said Binadi.
 ""We have received permission from the government. We cannot re-register with the rebels. If we register with them, the state will see us with suspicion, says Hari Kumari Gurung, project officer of Save the Children US.
 Chief of Maoist Salyan district government Bhaskar says that the reason behind such pressure is that the rebels want recognition of their 'autonomous government'.

"1206",20031692,"Title: Crooked officials said to cost Asia a fortune.rtf; Date: December 4, 2003 Thursday; Text: Fighting a rising tide of corruption in Asia is crucial to the struggle against poverty, but crooked officials, legal loopholes and public apathy are costing some countries a fortune, an international conference heard here.
One-third of public investment in many Asia-Pacific countries is squandered on corruption, with governments paying between 20 to 100 percent over the top for goods and services due to corrupt procurement practices, delegates were told.
And while suspiciously wealthy public servants in developed Hong Kong are liable to be sacked even without proof of wrongdoing, in countries such as impoverished Vanuatu they are more likely to become untouchable ""big men"".
The depressing facts and figures were presented to representatives from 35 countries attending the Fourth Regional Anti-Corruption Conference for Asia-Pacific, organised by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The conference, which ends Friday, is reviewing progress made by 21 countries which have endorsed an ADB-OECD ""Anti-Corruption Action Plan"" launched in Manila in 1999, under which they are committed to combating bribery and money laundering and promoting public sector integrity.
A preliminary report and individual presentations show a wide gap between words and deeds and between practices in developed and developing economies.
Singapore requires public officials to declare annually that they are debt-free and they must also report their holdings in investments and properties, their personal assets and shareholdings in closed companies.
Hong Kong holds a public official guilty of an offence if his standard of living is higher than warranted by his official earnings, even without proof of bribery, the report says.
But while many countries have anti-corruption legislation on their books, ""legal loopholes"" exist in some and in others the law is simply ignored.
Vanuatu, for example, is one of the signatories to the anti-corruption action plan, but a background paper presented by the country's president of Transparency International, Marie-Noelle Ferrieux Patterson, says crooked officials escape punishment.
""The frustrating thing in Vanuatu is that we actually do have the laws we require to protect the public from crooked leaders; what we lack is courage in enough people to use them.
""Even among the younger more educated people, many hide behind 'custom', excusing and justifying their timidity by claiming that it is against traditional Melanesian values to criticise 'big men'.""
ADB vice-president Geert van der Linden, however, told the conference that while ""several reports suggest that corruption has worsened in most countries in Asia one of the reasons is that people have become more conscious of and sensitive to corruption.""
""Fighting corruption is no longer just a moral issue,"" he said. ""It has become a major tool in the fight against poverty.""
Studies had shown that corruption can cost up to 17 percent of a country's gross domestic product, ""robbing the population of precious resources that can be used to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.""
Van der Linden tempered the bad news with good, saying ""a wave of anti-corruption sentiment has swept through Asia and the Pacific, and many governments have responded with resolve.""
He gave as examples a new Philippine law against money laundering, China actively prosecuting senior officials, South Korea approving whistleblower legislation and Nepal's establishment of a National Vigilance Centre.

They also agreed to open bank branches in the other's territory by the end of December after an absence of four decades as part of ongoing efforts to improve economic ties, Syed Asif Shah, Pakistan's commerce secretary, told reporters.
India agreed to buy cement from Pakistan, sell more tea to its neighbor and expedite removing non-tariff barriers in select sectors such as textiles and cement, Shah said at the end of the fourth round of India-Pakistan talks on economic and commercial cooperation.
The measures were part of wider efforts to boost bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010, the two officials said.
Bilateral trade nearly doubled to $1.67 billion in the financial year ended March 2007, from about $850 million a year earlier, an Indian government statement said.
""Our bilateral trade has grown phenomenally in the past few years,"" said India's Commerce Secretary Gopal Pillai.
The South Asian neighbors at present allow only a limited number of goods to cross into each other's territory despite the vast potential for bilateral trade.
They mainly trade in tea, iron ore, textiles, engineering goods, industrial raw materials and dried fruits.
India agreed to consider Pakistan's objection to New Delhi's recent announcement that it had approved ""Super Basmati rice"" for exports.
Pakistan developed ""Super Basmati rice"" in the 1960s and has been exporting it since the 1990s, Shah told reporters.
He said Pakistan has no objection to India selling the same variety of rice under a different name.
Political rivalry between the two nuclear-armed nations has also delayed implementation of a free trade pact among seven countries of the South Asian region India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Maldives and Bhutan.
India and Pakistan have lifted some trade barriers and allowed the shipment of goods by road since they began peace talks in 2004 aimed at resolving a decades-old dispute over Kashmir, the cause of two of their three wars since they won independence from Britain in 1947.
Substantial trade between India and Pakistan is carried out through third countries like the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan, making products more expensive and resulting in lost customs revenue for the two countries.
""There is a strong case for us to see how we mainstream this diverted trade and reduce transaction costs to ultimately benefit the consumer on either side,"" Pillai said.

  They were speaking at a seminar on 'Present Political scenario in Nepal and its influence on India's Security' at the conference hall of Deen Dayal Upadhaya University today.
  The cell's Bihar general secretary Harendra Kumar said the Maoist problem had cropped up not only due to unemployment and poverty, but also because of a conspiracy hatched by China, communists of the country and Pakistan's ISI.
  He said China wanted to set up an army base in Nepal to launch an anti-India movement, while the aim of Pakistan was to push terrorists into India through the 1,750-km porous Indo-Nepal border.
  He said fake currency was being circulated to destabilise the Indian economy. Harendra added the ISI was involved in this and was using innocent Nepalese in transportation of illegal arms.
  He also said Communists were misusing youth power by providing them with guns. He also claimed communist leaders of India and China were funding the Maoist movement in Nepal and Naxalites in 15 States in the India.
  He claimed senior Communist leaders of India were in regular contact with the Nepal's Maoists. They had become a hurdle in the supply of arms to the Royal Army of Nepal, he said.
  State general secretary Nagendra said as Chandauli was in the grip of Naxalites, Gorakhpur might face the same situation, as it was close to Nepal.
  Presiding over the seminar, BJP MP Yogi Adityanath said increasing number of mosques and madarsas within a 10 km radius of the Indo-Nepal border was a matter of concern.
  He claimed ISI was using madarsas and mosques for an anti-India movement, adding that 350 mosques and 300 madarsas had been established in that area.
  He said a similar number of mosques and madarsas had been set up in Nepal, which was a Hindu country.
  The chief guest, Lt Col (retired) NB Thapa admitted that the number of mosques, madarsas and churches were increasing rapidly.
  He said, ""It is a matter of concern for Nepal."" 
  Thapa added people from Bangladesh and Pakistan had taken citizenship of the country illegally and their number was increased. He added some Christian organisations were encouraging poor people to adopt Christianity.
  He urged the Government to provide help to Nepal to combat the Maoists.

The strike has kept Nepal's 7.5 million students from kindergartens to universities out of class since June 6 and wasted some 5.6 million dollars allocated to the schools, an education ministry official said.
He said the deal was reached after the government agreed to remove the pro-Maoist All Nepal National Independent Students Union-Revolutionary, which called the strike, from its list of terrorist groups.
He said authorities also promised to avoid ""indiscriminate arrests and disappearances of students"" which the Maoists allege are commonplace.
The student union's president, Lekhanath Neupane, issued a statement calling off the strike with immediate effect.
""However, our means of pressure remains unchanged and we may resume our actions if the government breaks its commitments,"" he said.
Umesh Shrestha, president of the association representing private schools, welcomed the deal but urged the Maoist supporters to commit against holding strikes in the future.
Some school administrators said they shut down during the strike out of fear of reprisals rather than sympathy for the rebels. An Indian-run school in Kathmandu that stayed open suffered damage on June 9 in an attack by suspected Maoists.
University students have played active roles in political movements in Nepal including the Maoist insurgency, which seeks to overthrow the monarchy.
The Maoists have taken over much of the countryside in their armed campaign and have regularly targetted small-town teachers, who they see as agents of the Kathmandu elite because they follow a centralised curriculum.
The civil war has claimed more than 9,500 lives in the Himalayan kingdom since 1996.

"7460",20113203,"Title: Families at odds over love marriages drag in police.rtf; Date: June 5, 2011 Sunday; Text: KATHMANDU, June 5 -- In a social milieu that seemingly accepts love marriages more than ever before, there is still vehement opposition to an individual's choice of spouse if it is made without the family's nod. A lot of love stories tending to matrimony are reaching the police.
Metropolitan Police Crime Division (MPCD) over the last three months dealt with at least 50 cases in which the parents of one or the other of the fugitive couple lodged a complaint requesting a search for their son or daughter, and sometimes even raising suspicions of kidnapping.
""Parents want us to find the eloping couple so that they will have an opportunity to fulfill an array of purposes-in some cases even split the couple,"" said an official working at MPCD's Women and Children Cell. ""It shows that a good many urban parents are yet to come to terms with the marital decisions of their offspring.""
Police end up tracking down honeymooning couples, using all available tools like mobile phone tracking and waylaying them as if they are absconding criminals. ""When parents approach us with serious concern about their children being lost, we are supposed to go after them regardless of the circumstances,"" said Inspector Dipti Karki, who heads the cell.
The motives of parents tracking down such couples are interesting. Some just make sure that their son or daughter is safe, and turn back. Most of them, going by details narrated by police officials, seek to know about the character and financial prospects of the partners their children have chosen.
Reema (name changed), an educated 23-year-old who has recently landed a good job at a bank, ran off with her boyfriend who is from a caste unacceptable to her family and is not on par in terms of financial background. Her father reached MPCD to be able to see her at least once and vent his grievances as a guardian ''who expected something 'nicer' from her.''
Things become nasty when the families of both the girl and the boy claim to be victims and start a blame game. ""There are even chances of complaints about telephone threats and physical assault,"" said officials.
MPCD had formed the special cell to deal with high-profile cases that did warrant looking into. But it has unwittingly ended up making efforts to reconcile parties at odds over marriages for love. Such cases are often referred to the MPCD cell from other police units when focused investigations appear to be necessary.
Nepal Police's Women and Children Service Cell (WCSC), which looks after most cases related to women and children in the capital valley, handle such complaints regularly. ""We have to resolve such cases because they are a reality in our society,"" said Inspector Harshamaya Shrestha, WCSC chief.
Communications gap main culprit
Under Nepali law a girl who has crossed 18 years of age can marry a boy of her choice, and the boy has to be 21 or above to make an independent decision. But parents pour out their grievances even in cases where their children have taken a decision that is theirs by right.
Karki observes that both parents and the children are to blame.
""If children communicate fully with their parents before taking such decisions and if parents exercise enough patience to hear them out, the number of cases reaching us would be quite low,"" she said. ""Gap in communications between family members is taking this form.""
""Even when a daughter leaves home taking along just the necessary belongings, the parents come to us with suspicions that she might have been tricked,"" she added.
This negative aspect of love marriages sharply contrasts with the increasing trend of civil marriages with family consent followed by social arrangements. ""Trouble basically occurs when the couple hastens to 'have a shot at it',"" Karki said.
Distance not making heart grow fonder
Just as elopements ruffle many feathers, break-ups of marriages in which a partner-usually the husband-is far away for long stretches seems to have evolved as a social problem also. ""In such cases, former the husband complains that the wife has dumped him and taken all the money and other property,"" said MPCD officials.
""We have seen a lot of such instances. We just focus on arranging a meeting between them so that they might possibly sort things out. Nothing beyond that is possible!""

 Pokhara western Nepal , 6 November: At a time when the disgruntled leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML have been pressuring the party to quit the government for its inability to hold talks with the Maoists, a minister of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's party, Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Homnath Dahal, said that his party is ready to quit the government if anyone dares to solve the Maoist problem.
 When the government has been saying that some government ministers are in secret contact with the Maoists, Minister Dahal denied that and said that no reliable contact has been established with the rebels until now for talks.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Nov 04 p1
He was speaking at a programme in Pokhara Saturday 6 November .  passage omitted: He said that if anyone dares to solve the Maoist problem then his party will leave the government.
 He said that the government is in confusion because the rebels have not given their official opinion and that the government would be forced to go for elections if the Maoists do not come for talks.

 Rebel chief Prachanda, leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), said in a statement that Deuba is under too much pressure from the palace, the army and from a foreign power to be able to create an atmosphere conducive to a resumption of talks.
Those power centers, he said, have essentially told Deuba, 'You raise the issue of talks while we prepare for war.'
 In a media interview, meanwhile, chief rebel negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara ruled out resumption of peace dialogue in the near future, saying the government is making massive preparations for war against the rebels under the cover of its call for peace talks.
 He also rejected secret negotiations proposed by Deuba earlier this week, saying matters concerning the people should not be discussed in secrecy.

"5956",20072559,"Title: Nepal Maoist leader calls for monarchy's end at Kathmandu rally.rtf; Date: February 13, 2007 Tuesday 12:50 PM GMT; Text: Maoist leader Prachanda vowed Tuesday to push to abolish the monarchy and create a ""new Nepal"" as he addressed tens of thousands of supporters in his first public speech in the capital in 25 years.
""Unless the monarchy is eliminated, a new Nepal cannot come into existence,"" Prachanda, or 'the fierce one', said as his flag-waving supporters roared their approval.
The rally, which brought the heart of the city to a standstill, took place on the 11th anniversary of the start of the Maoist revolt that ended last November when the rebels signed a historic peace deal with the government.
""This is a memorable day for us as our 10 years of people's war has been able to establish new norms and values for the country to head towards the path of a republic,"" he added, in what organisers said was his first public speech here since the early 1980s.
Security was tight as the demonstrators listened to their formerly reclusive leader, who has emerged from a quarter-century underground vigorously to press his cause.
The Maoist leader spoke for just under an hour in a vast open-air theatre and was frequently interrupted by cheering supporters waving red flags and holding banners declaring ""Long live the Maoist party,"" and ""Long live Prachanda.""
The former rebels entered parliament earlier this year, taking 83 out of 330 seats, but have yet to be given positions in the cabinet. 
Prachanda is not a member of parliament. But he said late last year he was willing to serve as president of a future Nepal republic ""if the masses want to give me the responsibility and if my party chooses me as the best candidate.""
Under last year's peace deal, the fate of the embattled King Gyanendra is to be decided in crucial polls that will elect a body to rewrite Nepal's constitution permanently.
The elections to the constituent assembly are supposed to be held by mid-June.
But on Monday, Ian Martin, the UN envoy to Nepal's peace process, warned the deadline could be missed unless parliamentarians swiftly pass legislation to hold the polls.
""If constituent assembly elections cannot be held by mid-June, we should be ready to declare Nepal a democratic republic by mid-May,"" Prachanda told the crowd.
The mass meeting was an opportunity for the former rebels to demonstrate their level of popular support, political analysts said.
King Gyanendra seized direct control of Nepal in early 2005, saying the move was needed to suppress the insurgency which claimed some 13,000 lives.
But huge pro-democracy protests organized by the Maoists and political parties led to the king restoring parliament in April 2006.
The future of Gyanendra will be decided by the constituent assembly body that will write Nepal's new constitution.
At least 13,000 people were killed and between 100,000 and 200,000 people were displaced in Nepal during the civil war.

Tabei, who arrived here to attend celebrations next week marking the 50th anniversary of the conquest of the mountain by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary, said climbing on Everest had become too commercialised.
""New mountaineering techniques have been developed. The ropes are pre-fixed before the climber reaches the summit of Everest,"" she said.
""Climbing Mount Everest is now becoming more commercialized than other mountain sports,"" she lamented.
Recalling her ascent of Everest in 1975, Tabei said, ""During those days permission for the Mount Everest assault by women was very difficult but now it is easier and so many teams are going there.""
""Permission for expeditions to climb Mount Everest should be limited to three per year at the most,"" Tabei said in response to a question. ""Let the mountain remain in peace.""
While scaling the peak was not that difficult, she added, ""the main problem is the weather.""
Asked whether she wants her daughter and son to follow in her footsteps to the top of earth's tallest pinnacle, Tabei replied, ""My son is now 24 and studying at university and my 32-year-old daughter is more inclined to skiing than mountain climbing.""
Tabei has climbed several major peaks -- Cho Oyu and Everest in Nepal, and Xixapangma in Tibet -- as well as Broad Peak in Pakistan.
""I want to climb major peaks as far as possible on all continents,"" Tabei said.
She welcomed the decision of the Nepalese authorities to stage special celebrations to mark the Golden Jubilee of the conquest of Everest, adding she hoped to meet many Everest summiters in the next week.
The Mount Everest Golden Jubilee organisers are planning to honour Taibe, 12-times Everest summiter Apa Sherpa and other distinguished alpinists with a horse-drawn procession through the streets of Kathmandu next week, Nepal Tourist Board (NTB) sources said.
Tabei was to leave Kathmandu for Lukla, in the Everest region, by air Thursday to have another view of the famous peak before returning to Kathmandu on May 26 to participate in the celebrations.
More than 200 foreign Everest conquerors are scheduled to participate.
Among them are Hillary and his son Peter, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler, who climbed Mount Everest in 1978 without the aid of artificial oxygen, and Tenzing Norgay's son Jamling, organisers said.

Hundreds of soldiers have been transported to the area near Malangawa, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Katmandu, where Maoist rebels bombed government buildings and attacked security bases Wednesday night.
Six policemen, five rebels and two civilians were killed in the attack, the Home Ministry said. The rebels also took 28 hostages, police said.
""We have not been able to trace the official and policemen missing but a search is underway,"" said police official Rajan Limbu, adding that government troops had regained control of the area.
Security officials, meanwhile, said troops would remain alert on Friday, the second day of a four-day general strike called by Nepal's seven opposition political parties to protest King Gyanendra's direct rule since last year.
The strike is backed by the communist rebels, who have fought for a decade to oust the king.
In the Katmandu, officials said they would not allow any protests against the government.
More than 170 activists who defied a ban on rallies in Katmandu on Thursday were arrested by policemen who used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. Communist party leader Khadga Prasad Oli said protests would continue Friday morning.
The king argues he was forced to seize power in February last year because of the growing insurgency, which has killed some 13,000 people since 1996. He has been under international pressure to restore democracy.
Soon after taking power, the king imposed a state of emergency and placed restrictions on the media. Although the emergency decree was lifted, the government has continued to crack down on opposition politicians and activists.

Top leaders of major parties, including Maoist Chairman Puspa Kamal Dahal and Nepali Congress' Senior Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba, have been saying that NA's integration option - formation of a separate force comprising personnel from the state security forces and Maoist combatants under a Major General of NA for special task - was a positive move.
""If it is their (NA's) view, then it should be discussed at the Special Committee, which is the proper channel,"" said Ram Sharan Mahat, a member of NC to the SC. ""But leaders are frequently using it in their speeches only."" Mahat, who is also a member of the SC taskforce to submit a detailed 50-day plan of action for PLA's integration modality, norms, number and rehabilitation packages, even questioned the authenticity of NA proposal, which Chief of the Army Staff Chhatra Man Singh Gurung had briefed to former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal as a possible alternative for PLA integration.
The taskforce, which was initially given a four-day deadline for preparing a 50-day integration plan of action on March 23, has become defunct, as the set timeframe (the 50-day integration action plan) before May 28 has already been missed.
The taskforce includes Janardan Sharma from the UCPN-M, Ishwor Pokharel from UML, Mahat from NC and JP Gupta from MJF-Nepal. Since its inception, they have met only thrice. There has been no meetings for the last three weeks.

Reverses can affect anyone, rich or poor, famous or obscure, and it can be a testing time for all concerned. What distinguishes the brave and determined from the rest is how they handle it, and fight back. Jyoti Randhawa and Indrajit Bhalotia have been victims of accidents that could have had a debilitating effect and put a stop to what they do well -- play golf. But both have emerged from the trauma, and while Randhawa has reached greater heights, Bhalotia is on his way back.
  Apart from golf, one of Randhawa's passions is his 1000 cc motorcycle and it was astride this that he had a pretty bad accident in 2002.
  ""I suppose I was driving a bit too fast,"" Randhawa concedes, while recalling the accident. ""I was trying to pass between two cars on the highway, when one of them braked. I skidded, and next thing I knew, I was sliding down the road at about 80 kilometres per hour, with my bike tearing down behind me. I knew almost immediately that I had broken my collar bone.""
  Needless to say, golf stopped immediately. ""Why golf, after you encounter something like this, everything you do, or would like to do in life, changes. Simple daily chores become difficult.""
  The injury kept Randhawa off the golf course for about six months. ""I really didn't think much about whether I'd play again or not, simply because I was sure I would come back,"" he says. ""So I just relaxed and took my time.""
  Evidently, it worked, since that year Randhawa went on to top the Asian PGA Order of Merit. ""I suppose being away from the game, and realising what I was missing helped me in performing better.""
  It was a learning experience and Randhawa has a message for those similarly afflicted. ""First of all, try and avoid putting yourself in a situation where your life, and your means of earning bread and butter are affected.
  ""But in the event something does happen, do not get overly affected by it. If you stay mentally strong, you can overcome almost everything."" Incidentally, Bhalotia's experience also involves a bike.
  ""This was in Chennai in September 2003. I was visiting a market with my wife when a bike, coming down the wrong side, hit me. I went flying and injured wrist and right knee. I had sessions with a doctor and physio for about six weeks, but after that we realised that fluid was collecting in the knee, never a good thing for an athlete.
  ""I was given a choice -- lay off golf or undergo surgery, and I chose the latter, since surgery was never the best option."" The injury, coming towards the beginning of the season, kept Bhalotia away from the course for over a year.
  ""Physically, I was one of the fittest players on the tour. The accident threw me totally off. I have picked up weight, and will have to work hard to get back. ""More than the physical part, it was mentally tough to get back,"" Bhalotia says. ""There was always a bit of fear, and then there is this strange feeling that you don't belong.
  ""When I was playing on the circuit full-time, there was a sense of belonging, and you could sense that the others playing were apprehensive about competing against me. But once I stayed away for so long, that feeling of not fitting in was dominant.""
  But return he did, playing in Nepal a while ago, and slowly Bhalotia is on his way back. He is too good a player to be kept away for too long, and it is just a matter of time before he grabs hold of his fear, and turns it back towards his opponents.

""The EU considers the promulgation of the interim constitution and the formation of the interim parliament and government as important milestones in the peace process in Nepal,"" the German presidency said in a statement.
Berlin said the EU ""looks to the new government to operate in line with democratic principles"" and ""to restore law and order"" in the impoverished Himalayan nation which suffered a decade of civil war.
Former Maoists rebels who signed a peace pact with the country's mainstream parties in November were on Sunday sworn into a new cabinet.
It must steer Nepal to elections on June 20 -- which will lead to a decision on whether the country keeps its 238-year-old monarchy or becomes a republic.

 Kathmandu, 26 June: The president of the biggest party spearheading the mass movement of the four political parties, Girija Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress, is travelling to New Delhi on Sunday 27 June on a five-day private visit.
 Central level leader of the Nepali Congress charka Prasad Bastola has hinted Koirala may meet with Maoist leaders during his stay in India. Although he repeated he did not have the details about Koirala's visit, he did not say anything regarding whether Koirala would meet Maoist leaders or not.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 27 Jun 04, p1
""He has already said that he will make initiative to hold talks with the Maoists. He will also meet with Indian leaders. With this in background, I cannot say who he will meet,"" he told a programme in Kathmandu Saturday 26 June , ""difficulties may arise if all things are revealed now.""
 The Central Committee of the Party has entrusted Koirala with the responsibility of initiating a dialogue with the Maoist to resolve the Maoist problem. On 20 June, he told a mass gathering that his party was open to a constituent assembly a major demand of the Maoists and that he would hold dialogue with the Maoist rebels.
 During Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's earlier term in office, Koirala had held talks with top Maoist leaders Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, and Dr Babu Ram Bhattarai in New Delhi. Although at the initial stage he had maintained secrecy, he later admitted to meeting the Maoist leaders.
 Shekhar Koirala, who is travelling to Delhi with President Koirala however said there were no plans to meet the Maoist leaders. ""President does not have any programme to meet Maoist leaders,"" Shekhar Koirala told Kantipur.
 According to family sources, he will undergo medical tests in Apollo and All India Medical Institute. The 81-year-old leader has been suffering from chest related ailment for the past few days.
 Koirala will meet Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Prime Ministers Atal Behari Vajpayee and Chandra Shekhar.

"896",2003372,"Title: Leading Nepal Maoist urges statesmanship, more talks.rtf; Date: November 30, 2003, Sunday; Text: Nepalese Maoists maintain their policy on the need for three-way talks with the king and the parliamentary parties to reach a permanent solution to the crisis in the country, a Maoist leader has said. He called on ""all those committed to the people and the nation to make the maximum sacrifice and show understanding for a new political outlet by abandoning narrow party and group interests"". He said that the talks between Maoists and the Unified Marxist-Leninists was a positive beginning but was not enough. He added that ""an understanding and working relationship with Nepali Congress, a parliamentary force, is even more essential and necessary"". Following is the text of a commentary by leading Maoist Dr Baburam Bhattarai, headlined ""Maoist-UML talks are natural, will continue"", published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 30 November
 The recent talks between senior leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML have received attention at home and abroad. It is natural that the political meeting and discussion between the country's two prominent political forces during a grave political crisis should get such attention. It is also natural that different forces at home and abroad should interpret or misinterpret this political dialogue from their own standpoint and level of understanding.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 30 Nov 03 pp 1,2
First, it should be clear to all that the dialogue was conducted in a planned and more or less open manner while both sides were alert, and there is no need to take to view it with suspicion.
 Our party has accepted right from the beginning that there are three forces in the country and, for a permanent solution, we have proposed talks and dialogue between us, the king and parliamentary parties. During the last cease-fire and peace talks, we continuously met and had dialogue and talks with the old state monarchists on the one hand and the parliamentary parties standing between the old state and the new state i.e. the current and would-be systems .
 It is evident to all that for a new struggle our party has decided to continue talks and dialogue with all, and particularly with parliamentary parties fighting royal regression i.e. for the restoration of an elected government .
 Many foreign power centres with vested interests have incited militarists inside the country and created a situation where a political solution could not be found. It is only natural that this type of high-level talks should get prominence after our party's politburo meeting last month concluded that a bilateral struggle between the monarchy and the parties for a permanent solution was slowly emerging in place of a trilateral struggle between monarchy, parties and Maoists .
 The meeting decided to hold new talks with parliamentary parties. It is in this context that the first round of talks with the main opposition in the dissolved parliament, the UML, was held and it is our party's declared policy to hold similar talks with the Congress and other parties.
 As far as what transpired in the talks with the UML, the senior leaders of the two responsible parties, at a decisive and serious point in history, discussed all important issues that needed to be taken up.
 Rising above mean and narrow party interests, talks were held seriously for two days, centred on how to find an effective political outlet sought by the nation and people.
 During the meeting the two parties with different with separate strategies and programmes presented different views, which is natural. Even though both the sides have concentrated their efforts on finding a common meeting point among their differing action plans and towards giving a progressive way out to the country.
 Though confusion was created when some media, citing CPN-UML leader Madhav Nepal, published reports about the bilateral talks, we think that his 24 November interview in a national daily has made many things clear. Those are the main points of the bilateral talks. The UML put its points and so did the Maoists. On some points there was agreement, and on some there was disagreement.
 Among the much talked of Silguri talks in 2000 , the Kathmandu talks during the cease-fire and the recent talks, which I attended, I think the talks this time were more positive. And the result of the talks will depend upon the degree of similarity that Madhav Nepal will show in his words and action.
 And that also applies to our party and the leadership. On behalf of the party, what we want to assure everyone is that there has never been any difference between our words and action and this time and in future too it will be the same.
 And we are not surprised that these talks has troubled most the royal fascist elements and their henchmen. The target has been hit and it has troubled the right person.  As in the proverb when someone said ""cut off the thief's leg"", the thief has rem"

At a time when the government is facing pressure to reciprocate the unilateral ceasefire extended by the Maoists for a month, Chief of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) Gen Pyar Jung Thapa has described the extension of unilateral truce by Maoists as a ploy.
Addressing RNA personnel of the Sher Battalion in Dolakha on Monday [5 December], Gen Thapa further accused the rebels of moving forward to fulfil their ""crooked objective"" under the pretext of a ceasefire.

Stating that Maoists are not serious to restore peace in the country, he added the Maoists are not sensitive towards peoples' aspiration for peace. Stating that history is witness to the fact that the king, people and the army have joined hands to rescue the country in the times of crisis, Thapa expressed the determination to repeat history to achieve success this time around as well.
He reiterated the army's commitment for protection of human rights and added: ""We are giving high priority to the protection of human rights and implementing the directions received in this regard.""

CIAA officials had formally asked Special Court Registrar Dhir Bahadur Chand over the phone on Monday afternoon to wait till the last moment (of office hours) as they were filing case.
""CIAA spokesperson Ishwori Paudel phoned me to say they were filing case by Monday evening (before 5 PM),"" said Chand, adding, ""Paudel phoned again at 5 PM and said sorry for keeping me waiting.""
The question arises why the anti-graft body could not file case at the Special Court even after informing in advance that it would do so? Was it due to inadequate time to prepare a charge sheet as claimed by CIAA officials or was it serious differences that obstructed them?
A source at the CIAA claims that the charge sheet is already ready. However, they are delaying the case due to serious differences between Secretary Kafle and investigation officers Dilli Raman Acharya and Ishowri Paudel over the names and numbers of those they want to indict.
""Secretary Kafle has been trying to indict nearly two dozen officials ranging from inspectors to former police chiefs,"" the source said, adding, ""Kafle is so adamant that the two investigation officers are in a dilemma.""
Filing of the case was further delayed Monday as a new dispute arose regarding the involvement of incumbent AIGs-Kalyan Timalsena and Arjun Jung Shahi.
According to the source, a document showing a slight involvement of the two AIGs in the decision making appeared abruptly at the commission Sunday evening from some 'unknown source'. Matters then took another turn, the source added.
The source at the anti-graft body claims Kafle is hell-bent on indicting the two AIGs also while the investigation officers argue that the AIGs were not responsible in the scam. ""The two AIGs' role was not crucial,"" the source quoted the two officers as telling Kafle.
The CIAA has been probing irregularities in the procuring of armored personnel carries (APCs) and other logistics for Nepali peacekeepers in Darfur, Sudan.
According to the source, the commission has already concluded that Rs 300 million, out of the Rs 440 million involved in the procurement deal, was embezzled.
Besides three former police chiefs --Om Bikram Rana, Hem Bahadur Gurung and Ramesh Chand Thakuri and some other senior police officers, the anti-graft body has already decided to file case against Michael Rider, director of London-based Assured Risks company that supplied the APCs and other logistics, and Shambhu Bharati, local agent of the company.

"3914",20052964,"Title: Rains hamper search for rebels, missing soldiers after Nepal clash.rtf; Date: August 10, 2005 Wednesday 6:35 AM GMT; Text: Monsoon rains have severely curtailed the search for Maoist rebels who launched a deadly attack in northwestern Nepal that left 75 soldiers missing and scores dead, the army said Wednesday.
""The visibility is very bad -- just 30 meters (27 yards),"" an army official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Another missing soldier had been traced by Wednesday, the official said, leaving 75 still unaccounted for after Sunday night's attack by hundreds of rebels on an army camp in a remote jungle area in the northwest of the country.
The army said Tuesday that 40 soldiers had been killed in the attack. It accused the rebels of lining them up and shooting them in the head.
The rebels have acknowledged 26 of their fighters died in the attack, the deadliest since King Gyanendra seized power in February. The rebels said they killed 159 Nepalese soldiers -- a claim the military has dismissed.
The army official said that according to locals, around 200 rebels died in the all-night gunbattle but their bodies were taken away by their colleagues.
On Tuesday state television, also citing locals, said some 300 rebels had died.
The claims from either side could not immediately be independently verified but the acknowledged death toll of 40 soldiers is the highest since King Gyanendra grabbed power in February saying the move was necessary to tackle the Maoist revolt.
Analysts say the military appears to have made little headway since then against the rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy and install a communist republic. The conflict has claimed some 12,000 lives.
US ambassador to Nepal James F. Moriarty warned Tuesday that the Himalayan kingdom could slide into chaos unless King Gyanendra reconciled with political parties.
""Unless the principles of freedom, civil rights and democracy once again take root through a process of true reconciliation among the legitimate political forces, I fear Nepal will inexorably slide towards confrontation, confusion and chaos,"" Moriarty said.

"4703",20063086,"Title: Freed opposition politicians in Nepal say they will continue to push for king's downfall.rtf; Date: February 18, 2006 Saturday 12:22 AM GMT; Text: Dozens of political detainees released by Nepal's Supreme Court said they would continue to press their campaign against the king, who seized power a year ago.
Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the release of the 37 detainees on Friday. Judges Pramananda Jha and Rajendra Koirala ruled that they did not find any reason for the detentions and ordered the government to immediately free them.
The detainees included senior members of seven political parties, which have formed an alliance to press for democracy in the Himalayan nation. Thirteen of them were brought to the court while the rest were released from several detention centers in the capital, Katmandu.
""This is a victory for those who believe in democracy. We will continue our struggle for democracy and immediately return to our movement,"" said Raghuji Pant of the Communist Party of Nepal.
Pant was arrested in a police raid on Feb. 1 as the government tried to foil opposition plans to boycott and disrupt municipal elections on Feb. 8.
Hundreds have been jailed since King Gyanendra seized power a year ago and declared a state of emergency, some for a few days and others for several months.
Friday's ruling by the Supreme Court came ahead of a protest scheduled for Sunday to mark Democracy Day, which celebrates a popular movement of the 1980s that forced the previous king to establish a multiparty democracy.
Gyanendra said he took power to quell a festering communist insurgency and wipe out corruption in the government that alienated a majority of Nepal's 27 million people.
But the move sparked an alliance between the rebels and the seven political parties to hasten Gyanendra's downfall, and fighting between the guerrillas and security forces has since intensified.
This past week, the Royal Nepalese Army launched a major offensive in southwest Nepal, deploying thousands of troops to the mountainous districts of Palpa and Nawalparasi. Army helicopters have also been intermittently bombing to flush out rebels from the area, which has been mired in violence since the guerrillas ended a unilateral cease-fire last month.
The massive air and ground offensive appeared to be pushing the guerrillas back. The rebels issued a statement Thursday saying they were withdrawing a blockade of the main highways in the region.
Also they freed two government officials who were abducted during the weekend, said Deepak Joshi, the top government administrator for Kapilbastu district. They were handed to local human rights workers near Madhura village, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Katmandu.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have fought for a decade to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.

"5152",2006630,"Title: Nepalese economy to make positive strides_ central bank.rtf; Date: May 13, 2006 Saturday 3:00 AM EST; Text: The overall economic growth rate  in Nepal's current fiscal year, will be 1.8 percent, according to  preliminary estimates, state-run Radio Nepal reported Saturday.
    Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of the country, stated that the economic growth rate will not be high due to the negative  impact of the long spells of droughts, the  decrease in government 's capital expenses, the impact on poultry industry due to the  suspected ""bird flu"" and the decline in power supply.
    Governor of the bank Bijaya Nath Bhattarai was quoted by the  radio as saying that the recent positive developments in the  country will help decrease the recession in the economy.
    ""The analysis of recent evolving positive developments in the  country suggest that the Nepalese economy is expected to take a  turnaround in the new fiscal year from the path of decelerating  economic growth,"" he said.
    Addressing the 51st anniversary of the bank held here Friday,  the governor said that under the changed circumstances, the  Nepalese economy is expected to benefit from the higher world  output growth.
    ""In addition, domestic as well as foreign investors' confidence is expected to increase,"" Bhattarai said.
    Likewise, consumer confidence fueled by increased private  sector remittances is expected to increase, he added.
    Bhattarai also noted that the past one-year remained "" economically excruciating"" period for Nepal. The intensification  of the decade long armed conflict, increased political instability and adverse weather conditions hit the economy hard.
    The Gross Domestic Product, according to Bhattarai, grew by  only 2.3 percent in 2004/2005, the lowest in the last ten years  except a negative growth in 2001/2002.
    He said that it was likely to fall further to 1.8 percent in  the current fiscal year, which will end on July 15, 2006.

"6881",20081591,"Title: INSURGENCY, POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT.rtf; Date: June 30, 2008 Monday 1:53 AM  EST; Text: Guwahati, June 30 -- ""Are we progressing with the rest of humanity in these fascinating times? Or have we miserably lost our way somewhere in our quest for ideological and fantastical old world goals of ""sovereignty"" and ""separate homeland? Do we ourselves know what we actually want or are we just trudging the burden of the past with a false sense of pride and honour?""
These bold, big questions were raised by one of the leading political personalities of the North Eastern region and former Chief Minister of Nagaland and now Governor of Goa (concurrently of Maharashtra) in his keynote address to a Round Table Conference on ""Sixty Years of North East. Revisiting the Experience"" held at Shillong on May 14, 2008. The former Chief Minister, who was in the thick of problems for about two decades and never compromised his nationalist principle even at great personal risk, was visibly a sad and anguished man.
I presume these very questions, which SC Jamir had asked in public, are asked by all right thinking people of this trouble-torn region in private for years, silently hoping to get an answer. These questions call for an objective and focused deliberation. The former Nagaland Chief Minister's observations provoked me to pursue it further and I did so during a recent meeting I had with him in his tastefully arranged office within the sprawling Raj Bhawan complex at Mumbai. During that intimate and frank discussion, he let the steam out of his anguished but honest heart. He thought that it was neither rational nor logical to fight for a so-called sovereign land. For one thing, no Indian leader, irrespective of party affiliation or ideological sensitivity, can ever compromise on the ideals and values enshrined in our Constitution, like the country's territorial integrity. ""This unassailable political imperative has to be understood by the collective leadership of the insurgent groups.""
At the same time, he asserted with deep conviction that the Indian Constitution was flexible and accommodative enough to help arrive at a peaceful, amicable, mutually acceptable and honourable solution of the continuing debilitating problem of the region. Vast majority of the region's population would, I believe, heartily welcome such a conflict resolution process. Given the necessary understanding, trust and goodwill, on both sides, this alternative may be able to pave the way for lasting peace which the people of the region have been longing for. The same may, therefore, be sincerely strived for.
There is an old saying that it is always wise to give up efforts to attain something seemingly unattainable. The Mizo National Front in Mizoram had realised this truth. After 20 long years of violent struggle they decided to take to ballot instead of the bullet. In so doing the leadership had shown pragmatism and maturity. The result is there for every one to see-return of a violence-free society and speedy socio-economic development. Of course, the Mizos were fortunate to have a farsighted leader and an ardent lover of peace in the person of Lal Thanhawla, the then Chief Minister who, of his own volition, volunteered to sacrifice the exalted office for the sake of peace. I can say this because I was associated with the peace process in a small way though. In recent times the Maoists in Nepal have opted for a similar path and preferred ballot to bullet to throw the 240 year-old monarchy to the dustbin of history and establish democracy in that country. The people of the North Eastern Region will surely expect the other insurgent outfits to take out a leaf from the Mizo National Front's history and the story of the Maoist movement in Nepal and try to capture political power not through the barrel of the gun but with the more powerful ammunition that our democratic polity offers- the ballot. And should not our political leaders demonstrate a spirit of sacrifice and dedication to peace so that peace and normalcy return to the region sooner than later? Both the wayward youths as also the powers that be must realise that alternative to this sane and rational course would mean that the people of the region ""tormented and plagued for decades, foundering in depths of despair and distress,"" shall not see any light at the end of the tunnel even after some decades more. Three axioms must also be appreciated by all the parties involved when conditions act as hurdles, these may not be obstinately stuck to, it is the spirit and not the letters that matters and talks break barriers.
The North East is disadvantaged on another count that is primarily political. In the existing political dispensation decisions concerning the States are taken, in most cases, keeping in view the numerical strength a State has in the highest people's forum. Whether one likes it or not, it is a fact. It is also a fact that no State in this region has that strength. Jamir's strategy to neutralise such disadvantage is to create a unique and special political framework for th"

"4141",20052950,"Title: Millions of the world's workers rally to mark May Day.rtf; Date: May 1, 2005 Sunday; Text: Millions of workers from Tokyo to Havana and across Europe took to the streets in May Day rallies and marches to demand improved conditions and protest government policies.
From a rally of 5,000 Bangladeshis seeking a minimum wage, to an estimated million Cubans gathered in the Plaza of the Revolution to hear Fidel Castro, workers expressed their solidarity on the traditional international labor holiday Sunday.
More than 500,000 Germans took part in marches and rallies across the country, many focusing on recent political debate accusing company executives of increasing earnings while squeezing workers' wages and slashing jobs.
""How crazy do these people think we are?"" Frank Bsirske, head of Germany's powerful Ver.di service workers union, told some 8,000 cheering union members at a rally in the capital, Berlin.
Russians protesting sweeping social reforms mixed with anti-government demonstrators in Moscow.
Thousands of Communists rallied under pictures of Lenin and Stalin along with traditional red-and-white, hammer-and-sickle banners with slogans like ""Rise, Save Russia!"" and marched down Tverskaya Street, one of Moscow's main boulevards.
Radical activists from the National Bolshevik Party and the Red Youth Avant-Garde political group fought briefly with riot police in the Russian capital.
French demonstrators used May Day to voice opinions on France's upcoming referendum on the European Union constitution and the government's decision to cancel a traditional Monday that falls on May 16 this year.
""Turkey + Constitution: No, I'll keep France,"" read one banner at a rally organized by far-right leader Jean-Marie le Pen and attended by several thousand protesters opposing the constitution and the EU's opening of membership talks with Turkey.
For others, the main issue was losing a day off.
""Don't mess with my holiday,"" read banners at a protest led by the Christian CFTC trade union in Paris that drew several thousand protesters.
The holiday has effectively been converted into an unpaid working day, with the government skimming off a sliver of employers' revenues and channeling the cash into a fund for the elderly. It's expected to reap [euro]2 billion (US$2.59 billion) per year.
Cuba's Castro used a vast May Day gathering in Havana to excoriate the United States, demanding it expel a Cuban-born militant accused of blowing up a civilian jetliner, and comparing attacks on Cuba to those on Sept. 11, 2001, in U.S. cities.
Castro called Luis Posada Carriles, 77, who is seeking asylum in the United States, ""the most famous and cruel terrorist of the Western hemisphere.""
Venezuelan officials say they will seek extradition of the Cuban-born Venezuelan citizen on charges of masterminding the bombing of a Cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people. Posada denies involvement.
The still fiery Castro, who has run Cuba since 1959, said the case of Posada ""shows the world the immense hypocrisy, the lies, the immoralities and the cynicism"" of the U.S. government, which has maintained Cuba on a list of states that support terrorism.
In front of Castro, a carpet of humanity spread across the vast plaza where a huge banner proclaimed, ""The work of this revolution is indestructible.""
China singled out more than 2,900 laborers - and a few athletes - for recognition on May Day, dubbing them ""model workers,"" as people across the country started a weeklong holiday with visits to squares and parks for kite flying and other recreation.
For decades, the model worker award has been turning unknown miners, teachers and factory workers into celebrities in the Chinese state media.
In the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, about 5,000 workers rallied to demand a minimum monthly wage of 3,000 takas (US$50; [euro]38.85) and better safety standards, weeks after a garment factory collapsed, killing 73 workers. There is no minimum wage in the poverty-stricken nation where inexperienced workers earn on average from 800 to 1,200 takas (US$13 to US$20; [euro]10 to [euro]15) per month.
Thousands attended two peaceful marches in the Nepalese capital, calling for King Gyanendra to end to his direct rule and a return to democracy.
Hundreds of thousands of Japanese workers rallied for a global ban on nuclear weapons, before the 60th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender on Aug. 15, 1945, after U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaski.
Riot police in Manila lined the streets amid rumors of a Labor Day plot to destabilize the government, similar to that of 2001, when thousands of supporters ousted former President Joseph Estrada. But only about 5,000 people turned out for largely peaceful demonstrations.
In the Chilean capital, Santiago, some 30,000 workers gathered in a peaceful downtown rally to hear a talk by Arturo Martinez, the president of Central Workers Union, the country's largest labor federation, who called for increased salaries and pensions. As the rally ended, police used tear gas an"
"4036",2005929,"Title: Japanese encephalitis death toll nears 1,000 in India and Nepal , doctors overwhelmed (2).rtf; Date: September 19, 2005, Monday, BC cycle; Text: An encephalitis outbreak has killed nearly 1,000 people - almost all of them children - in India and neighboring Nepal, as too few doctors struggle to care for thousands of sick children in outdated hospitals.
The death toll in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state stood Monday at 767, after 27 more deaths were reported overnight. Nepal has logged 204 deaths.
Every day, parents from the poorest corners of India's most populous state pour into the small town of Gorakhpur, some carrying unconscious children whose limp bodies flop from side to side as they're raced into one of the Japanese encephalitis wards at the B.R.D. Medical College.
But by the time many children arrive, there's little that can be done even to make them more comfortable. The tiny, often bare-chested children have oxygen masks taped to their faces - a grim scene stretching across two hospital floors.
For the handful of overworked doctors scurrying from patient to patient, it's an especially frustrating sight because the disease is easily preventable. Vaccines exist and measures can be taken to minimize exposure to the mosquitoes that spread the disease from pigs. But the tired physicians say such solutions might as well not exist without money and a strong political will to ensure that help reaches these poor, rural families.
Dr. O.P. Singh, director-general of health for Uttar Pradesh, has said it would cost about $58 million to vaccinate the more than 7 million children aged 15 and under in the most-affected areas. The state's entire health budget is $25 million.
""It's too hard for us also to see so many children and to see some dying and some handicapped and knowing this is a … disease that can be controlled by removing all pigs from society,"" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, a pediatrician overseeing the encephalitis wards.
Japanese encephalitis, closely related to West Nile virus, is found only in Asia, where it's the leading cause of neurological infection. The World Health Organization says about 50,000 cases are reported annually, including 15,000 deaths, but many more go unreported.
Eastern Uttar Pradesh is especially prone to the disease because it is a prime rice-growing region that breeds mosquitoes. Its bowl-shaped geography allows little drainage after rains. Also, farmers often raise pigs close to where people live.
The disease sickens only about 1 in 250 people infected - with children from 1 to 15 the prime prey. Most adults in affected areas have developed immunity.
The illness causes sweltering fevers, convulsions and comas, and can leave permanent damage. The WHO estimates that up to 75 percent of survivors suffer lifetime disabilities, ranging from paralysis to mental retardation to sometimes-violent behavioral problems.
In the dilapidated hospital in Gorakhpur, about 40 miles from the border with Nepal, Kushwaha is one of only about a half dozen doctors caring for children suffering from the disease.
The bespectacled man with warm eyes and a kind, weary face, bounces between the various units - intensive care, general and recovering - checking machines and oxygen tanks while signing papers and answering a horde of worried parents' questions.
He has worked at the hospital since 1978 and seen bad outbreaks before, but nothing like this. The onslaught began in late July and is starting to show some signs of slowing, although Kushwaha estimates the actual number of infected children is four to five times higher than those seeking treatment at the hospital.
The overload has forced doctors to place two children to a bed, even in the intensive care unit.
For many children, the virus is just too strong. Golu, a tiny 2 1/2-year-old boy, looked as if he were sleeping peacefully as his grandfather wrapped a blanket around him and carried his body out of the hospital for burial.

Even as police officials are appearing in court, being sent to jail and are released on bail, there are questions galore whether CIAA itself can be given a clean chit for conducting a fair investigation. And even CIAA officials concede that the anti-graft body had failed to delve deep into financial aspect of the scam though it issued blanket chargesheet against 36 persons, saying Rs 280 million was misappropriated while purchasing armoured personnel carriers for Nepal Police peacekeeping mission in Darfur of Sudan. ""Honestly speaking, we failed to follow the paper trail of the money that was embezzled. But we concluded that the police officials had misappropriated the funds and hence filed a corruption case against them,"" CIAA Spokesperson Ishwori Prasad Paudel told The Himalayan Times, adding that the existing legal and banking system make it difficult for CIAA officials to find out where the money was or is. Three ex-IGs Om Bikram Rana, Hem Bahadur Gurung and Ramesh Chand Thakuri are now out on bail after spending a night or two behind bars.
They have been vehemently opposing CIAA decision to indict them on corruption charges. CIAA's move was also questioned for 'sparing political and bureaucratic leadership'. Advocate Hira Regmi, who has been defending former police chief Om Bikram Rana, said the CIAA investigation was flawed for it failed to follow the paper trail despite concluding that millions of rupees were embezzled. ""If they (police officials) had amassed the money, CIAA must have tried to find out where they kept it,"" said Regmi. Rabi Raj Thapa, former AIG of the Armed Police Force, could not agree more. ""CIAA failed to investigate into the financial aspect and find who received what amount of money. Without answering these questions, the investigation cannot be complete."" Though Thapa said it was not that difficult to trace the money for it must have been transferred from one bank to another, CIAA maintained that existing legal provisions didn't allow them to investigate into personal bank accounts of the accused even if they have deposited the money in the banks. ""CIAA can seek details only from the government-owned banks, not from private commercial banks,"" said Paudel. He, however, pointed at the possibility that the accused might have siphoned off the money. But still, the question looms why CIAA did not seek help from the Interpol if that was the case. ""As a matter of fact, CIAA never probed where the accused deposited the misappropriated amount or whether they have deposited the money in the banks in their or their relatives' names,"" conceded Paudel. ""We don't think this was essential for our investigation; we believe anyone guilty of corruption must pay the penalty as per the court order."" Attorney General Yuba Raj Sangroula, however, said CIAA can reopen the investigation and look into financial aspect of the scam and then file a banking offence or money laundering case if they are found guilty. ""CIAA investigated the case with a different perspective - abuse of power and corruption. Therefore, it did not concentrate on where the money went,"" added Sangroula.

"7257",20091757,"Title: Dozens arrested in Nepal as anti-president protests erupt.rtf; Date: May 5, 2009 Tuesday; Text: Kathmandu, May. 5 -- Nearly four dozen people, including leading human rights activists, were arrested by police in Nepal Tuesday for defying prohibitory orders and protesting against President Ram Baran Yadav for reinstating the army chief sacked by the government.
Civil society leaders, who had played a prominent role during the pro-democracy movement in 2006 that led to the ouster of King Gyanendra's army-backed regime, were arrested for trying to stage a sit-in before Shital Niwas, the official residence and office of the president, where all rallies and demonstrations have been banned since Monday.
Protests began to erupt in other areas of the capital as the Maoists vowed to keep up their struggle against the president's ""unconstitutional step"" from parliament as well as the streets.
""We have the right to hold peaceful protests,"" said Devendra Raj Pandey, a leading human rights activist. ""We will keep up our protests till the president takes back his unconstitutional step.""
On Monday, soon after Maoist Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda said in a televised address to the nation that he was resigning in protest against the president's direct intervention and attempt to set himself up as a parallel centre of power, the district authorities clamped prohibitory orders around Shital Niwas and the headquarters of the army, the other key actor in the triangular drama that led to a fresh crisis in the Himalayan republic.
The Maoists are now demanding that the reinstated army chief, Gen Rookmangud Katawal, be sacked by the new government and the president be impeached.
Till their demands are met, the party Tuesday said it would not allow the interim parliament to function and would also keep up public protests.
The former rebels have also announced that they would boycott a meeting of all parliamentary parties called by their former allies, the communists, to strike up a new consensus government. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Indo-Asian News Service.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 9 June
Nepalgunj [town in mid-western Nepal], 8 June: The Maoists who are in peace talks with the government, have accused Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala of entering into a dangerous agreement with India and upsetting the peace talks. Speaking at a massive public assembly held Thursday [8 June] in Nepalgunj, Maoist central leaders also claimed that Koirala had gone to India to seek weapons.
Maoist army deputy commandeer Prabhakar claimed that Koirala has asked India for arms, adding: ""Girija has asked for arms to suppress the Nepali people, beware Girija, don't betray the country and the people"".
Warning that the result of this would be frightful, he said, ""If that is what has taken place, [we will] finish off not just the Nepali Congress but all the political parties"". Suggesting that India not make the mistake of providing arms to suppress the Nepali people, he said: ""Don't try to impose war on Nepal, what we want is peace. Otherwise 20 million Nepali people will become our weapon.""
Prabhakar set a time limit of one week for the seven political parties to dissolve parliament and the government and make preparations for a comprehensive national political conference. Otherwise the Maoists would hold a conference at Ratna Park [in the heart of the capital] and announce a ""new Nepal government"". ""On 2 June we could have captured Narayanhity [royal palace] and Bhadrakali [national secretariat] simultaneously, the whole capital was in the control of the People's Liberation Army"", he said adding: ""We did not do so out of honesty towards the people's wish for peace and the l2-point understanding"".
Military commander Prabhakar announced that the Maoists will never turn in their arms or work together under the government army and that the Maoist army will lead the national army. ""These are the weapons of the people, and there is no question of our turning them in until the people say so, and there is no question of working together with the government army either"", he said.
Prabhaklar said the seven parties are even now working with King Gyanendra and trying to maintain the monarchy in Nepal in response to cues from abroad. He also said a government that cannot take action against the army chief has been exposed. Also addressing the gathering, Maoist central member Matrika Yadav accused the government and the seven parties of not being serious about the peace talks and of trying to thwart the talks.
""They have becomes stooges of America and India, and are not honest in the least about peace and peace talks,"" he said, adding: ""If they want to save the king by not going for constituent assembly elections, the parties will not survive"". Pointing out that only two options now remain before the parties, he urged them to choose one option at once. ""Do they want to dissolve parliament immediately and go for the constituent assembly process or do they want to go to war with the people?' he asked, adding: ""If it is war they want they should come out for it openly"". [passage omitted]. 
Expressing anger that the government has not so far released Maoist prisoners and made public the situation of those disappeared, Yadav said, ""If there is a delay even now we will go and break down the jails"". [passage omitted]

During the meeting in Kathmandu they discussed the ceasefire announced by the government and Maoist rebels on January 29, foreign ministry officials said.
James, a former high commissioner (ambassador) to Kenya, arrived in Nepal earlier this week to coordinate UK and international efforts in support of the peace process. He is expected to brief the media on Friday.
British ambassador to Nepal Keith George Bloomfield was also at the meeting.
The government and the Maoists are working to finalize a ""code of conduct"" ahead of starting peace talks.
But the talks process could be complicated by the political turmoil which has hit the Himalayan kingdom since King Gyanendra sacked the elected prime minister in October and appointed Chand, a staunch royalist, as head of an interim government.
The Maoists, as well as most main political parties, believe Chand does not have a mandate to negotiate with them.

The Congolese armed forces (FARDC) fought with the rebel militias in Nioka, a town about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Bunia, the main Ituri city.
""There was heavy fighting and several members of the militia died, and at least one FARDC soldier was killed and several wounded,"" Major Hans Reichen, a military spokesman for the UN mission to the DRC, or MONUC, told AFP.
The retaking of Nioka was part of a vast security operation in the Ituri launched on December 19, which has resulted in the killing of about 30 militiamen, Reichen said.
Some 1,500 Congolese soldiers and nearly 400 UN ""blue cap"" peacekeepers have been mobilized in the region where Nepalese soldiers with the UN force came under attack on December 16, as they were returning from a security mission ahead of the country's constitutional referendum last Sunday.
Nioka had been seized a month ago by the militia chief Peter Karim, whose armed Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) was blamed for an attack on UN helicopters in June in northern Ituri that killed a Nepalese peacekeeper.
""After Nioka was taken, Peter Karim took flight to the north. Two of his bodyguards were captured and were being questioned by the FARDC,"" Reichen said.
According to UN observers, Karim runs a lucrative trade in wood with neighboring Uganda.
The majority of fighters for the FNI, like other armed groups in Ituri, surrendered their arms a few months ago as part of the DRC process for disarmament and reintegration in the community. 
The hold-out militiamen are estimated to number less than 2,000 men, according to MONUC.

Three explosions occurred in marketplaces in Agartala, the capital of Tripura state, while the fourth went off at a bus station, a police spokesman said by telephone from the town.
The Press Trust of India put the number of blasts at five but the report could not be immediately confirmed.
Most of the victims were shopping on the eve of Eid-al-Fitar, which marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, deputy inspector general of police Nepal Das said.
Television footage showed men carrying bleeding victims including women to hospitals.
""At least two of the blasts were powerful,"" Das said, adding that the serial explosions were the first such attacks in Tripura.
""These were bombs and we are trying to ascertain what kind of explosives had been used,"" he said, adding that the blasts all occurred within 45 minutes.
Ten of those hurt were in critical condition, he said.
Tripura is among a cluster of states in India's far northeast -- an area wedged between Myanmar, Bangladesh, China and Bhutan -- that is fighting long-running insurgencies by regional separatist groups.
However the fighting has declined in Tripura in recent years, Das said.

Text of report headlined ""Nepal rights official lashes out at government for not redressing conflict victims"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 8 September
Surkhet [mid-western Nepal], 7 September [Sunday]: Member of the National Human Rights Commission Gauri Pradhan has said that the government has made a mistake by not implementing the recommendations regarding giving compensation to the conflict victims.
At a meeting held in Birendranagar, Pradhan said, ""The government has paid compensation of one million rupees to some victims without investigating the related cases. But it has remained silent about paying compensations to those recommended by the commission.""
The government is not paying enough attention to pay compensations to those recommended by the commission because the victims are voiceless and without access to influential people. The commission has recommended a compensation of up to 300,000 rupees to each victim.
According to the mid-west regional office of the commission, the office had recommended to give compensation amounting to 20.67m rupees to the families of the people killed extra-judicially during the insurgency in the region. But nobody has received any compensation till date.
The rights commission had probed 28 cases of extra judicial killings and torture and recommended the government to pay compensations to the victim families. Compensation ranging from 25,000 to 275,000 rupees to 288 victim families. The largest compensation amounts have been recommended to the victims of the Kotbada incident of Kalikot district. Thirty-seven people were killed in indiscriminate army firing there on 20 June 2006. Each victim family of this case has been recommended to pay a compensation of 275,000 rupees. The commission has also asked the government to identify the culprits of the firing and take stern legal action against them. But the commission says that the government has taken no steps according to the recommendations.
The commission has recommended the government to give compensation of 150,000 rupees to 34 families of Laxmipur, Goltakuri, Masina and Bargadi of Dang district whose family members were killed by army men. The commission has recommended to pay 200,000 rupees to the family of Nepali Congress worker Ganesh Thapa, who was killed by the security forces. Compensation of 50,000 rupees has been recommended for the eight victim families of the Phulbari massacre.
The human rights commission has repeatedly requested the mid-western regional administration offices to implement the recommendations. The commission says that the requests were not heard.

Police had earlier reported that Maoists attacked security posts and government offices in the remote southwest but said there were no casualties.
""The terrorists attacked several places at Kailali in Dhangadhi district Wednesday night... but there are no injuries, deaths or abductions now,"" a senior police official told AFP, requesting anonymity. ""Everything is under control now.""
No independent confirmation of the incidents were possible due to the remoteness of the districts.
There was no immediate comment from the rebels, who ended their four-month unilateral ceasefire on January 2.
Since the end of the ceasefire, five policemen and 12 rebels have been killed while 11 people have been hurt in blasts and clashes nationwide.
The rebels have been battling since 1996 to topple Nepal's monarchy. Over 12,500 people have died since the insurgency began.
The Maoists have formed a loose alliance with mainstream parties to push for the drafting of a new constitution and the restoration of democracy after King Gyanendra seized power last Feburary.

"3153",20043050,"Title: Iraqi paper lists _resistance_ and _armed_ groups, aims.rtf; Date: September 20, 2004, Monday; Text: The Iraqi Journalists Union newspaper Al-Zawra has published a report on Iraqi ""resistance groups"" and ""armed groups"", describing their aims and affiliation to ""clarify"" the picture on Iraqi violence. The paper lists the groups under three categories, the ""Sunni resistance groups that primarily target US occupation"", the ""Shi'i resistance against occupation"" and ""factions which adopt abductions and killing"". The ""common denominators"" of the resistance groups are killing US soldiers, rejecting abductions or killing of hostages and attacks on Iraqi policemen and respecting the beliefs of other religions, the paper says. These groups have grown gradually until they ""matured"" and acquired their own political and military ""personality"" and weight, the paper said. The majority of these groups do not know their leadership, the sources of their financing or weapons, the paper said. The following is the text of report by Samir Haddad and Mazin Ghazi entitled ""Who kills hostages in Iraq?"", published by Iraqi Journalists Union newspaper Al-Zawra on 19 September; the main groups highlighted as subheadings:
 US soldiers guard the wreckage of a military armoured vehicle destroyed by the Iraqi resistance. In Iraq, the issues are even more confused now than they were before. This happened after an armed group abducted two French journalists and threatened to kill them if France did not revoke the law banning religious symbols at schools, including the veil, and another group abducted two Italian women in Baghdad. The issues became even more confused when a third group killed 12 Nepalese workers, claiming that they were serving the US forces.
Al-Zawra, Baghdad, in Arabic 19 Sep 04 p 4
It is our duty now to clarify the picture with regard to who targets civilians and foreigners, who abducts hostages indiscriminately, and who makes the US occupation and its soldiers their main preoccupation.
 After the fall of Baghdad into the hands of the Anglo-American occupation on 9 April 2003, as a natural reaction, several sectors of Iraqi society confronted the occupation. Resistance cells were formed, the majority of which were of Islamic Sunni and pan-Arab tendencies. These cells started in the shape of scattered groups, without a unifying bond to bind them together.
 These groups and small cells started to grow gradually, until they matured to some extent and acquired a clear personality that had its own political and military weight. Then they stated to combine themselves into larger groups.
 The majority of these groups do not know their leadership, the sources of their financing or who provides them with weapons. However, the huge amounts of weapons, which the Saddam Husayn regime left behind, are undoubtedly one of the main sources for arming these groups. These weapons include mortars, RPGs, hand grenades, Kalashnikovs and light weapons.
 Their intellectual tendencies are usually described as a mixture of Islamic and pan-Arab ideas that agree on the need to put an end to the US presence in Iraq.
 These groups have common denominators, the most important of which perhaps are focusing on killing US soldiers, rejecting the abductions and the killing of hostages, rejecting the attacks on Iraqi policemen and respecting the beliefs of other religions. There is no compulsion to convert to Islam, this stems from their Islamic creed, their reading of the jurisprudence texts and historical events, and their respect for the directives and appeals of the Islamic organizations and religious dignitaries.
 These groups believe the Iraqis are divided into two categories. One category - the majority - is against the occupation, and the other - the minority - is on the side of the occupation. The resistance considers those who reject the occupation, whatever their description might be, to be on its side. The resistance considers those who are on the side of the occupation to be as spies and traitors who do not deserve to remain on Iraqi territory, and hence they should be liquidated.
 As for their view of the political parties, it depends on the stance of these parties towards the occupation. If these parties are dealing with the United States on the basis that it is an occupation force that should be evicted and that Iraq should be liberated from any military occupation or constrictions, and if these parties choose to deal with the United States and to engage in political action within this context, then these parties are free to continue with their efforts. Moreover, in general, these groups do not target the political powers that deal, but do not cooperate with the United States within the political framework established by the occupation.
 The following is a review of the resistance groups and the armed groups in Iraq:

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 6 November
Kathmandu: Leader of Nepali Congress [party] Narahari Acharya has termed haphazard and hasty the remark of the US ambassador James F. Moriarty that party-Maoist talks were a dangerous indication.
Acharya, who recently returned to the capital from his 10-day trek around the highly Maoist affected districts in mid-western Nepal, said that the political parties are treading with extreme caution to hold talks with the Maoist rebels. Therefore, a country like America should not make such weightless remarks, he said.
Acharya said that even basic conditions have not been met at this point to hold talks with the Maoists. When he was in Rukum district [Maoist stronghold in mid-west Nepal] local Maoist leaders had asked him not to make criticism against the rebels. But he had told the Maoists that the rebels were not free from criticism, said Acharya.
Out of 50 people killed by the Maoists in Rukum, 42 belonged to Nepali Congress party. The rebels have not returned the land and houses of Nepali Congress workers they captured. At such a situation, how can Maoists be free from criticism? he questioned.
The talks with the rebels have not headed towards decisive direction as has been said by the American ambassador, he said.
During his tour of three districts that are highly Maoist affected, the local leadership of the Maoists had not disrupted any programmes of the political parties. The Maoists are not eating in the houses of the people. Instead, they are running their own mess, Acharya said.
Acharya said that the Maoists are working to create a suitable environment for talks [with parties].
NC leader Acharya thinks that Maoist-party alliance is necessary to make the movement successful. ""Talks with the Maoists will become necessary despite unwillingness of the party leadership,"" he said.
America is fearful that the collaboration between the political parties and the Maoists will isolate the king, Acharya said. [Passage omitted]

"5184",20063189,"Title: USA _ Watchdog releases annual press freedom survey.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: February 14, 2006 Tuesday
Text of press release by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on 14 February
New York, 14 February 2006 - Highlighting the global nature of its press freedom advocacy work, the Committee to Protect Journalists [CPJ] today released its annual press freedom survey Attacks on the Press in four cities: Bangkok, Cairo, London and Washington, D.C.
Reported and written by CPJ staff, Attacks on the Press is widely recognized as the most authoritative source of information on press conditions worldwide, and features a preface by Paul E. Steiger, CPJ chairman and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, and an introduction by CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper.
Attacks on the Press recounts a violent year in Iraq, which has become the deadliest conflict for journalists in a quarter-century.
Among trends documented in the latest edition are the assassinations of journalists in the Middle East, a surge in government persecution in Africa, the widespread jailing of reporters from China to Cuba, and pervasive self-censorship in Latin America.
CPJ's annual survey details hundreds of cases of media repression in dozens of countries, including murders, assaults, imprisonments, censorship, and legal harassment.
Attacks on the Press reports on several trends:
- Self-censorship is widespread in areas of Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil where crime and corruption are strong and government institutions weak. ""Burning issues such as the pillaging of natural resources, trafficking in drugs and people, and corruption are deprived the oxygen of public debate,"" Carlos Lauria writes.
- Assassinations of journalists in Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq have fundamentally changed reporting in the Middle East, where governments traditionally used non-violent methods to quell dissent. Now, writes Joel Campagna, ""A growing number of attacks against journalists have been carried out with impunity, forcing independent journalists across the region to ponder the consequences of what they write.""
- The U.S. government's policy of close cooperation with Eurasia's authoritarian leaders has undermined independent reporting in nations such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. ""At the same time, the administration's antiterrorism agenda has made it easier for the region's resourceful authoritarian leaders to justify repressive media policies in the name of security,"" Alex Lupis writes.
- More Asians are getting their news on the radio than ever before because of an explosion of community stations and an infusion of international financing. But as radio becomes powerful, challenges emerge. ""In Nepal and Thailand, leaders retaliated with crackdowns on radio stations, while radio journalists in Afghanistan and the Philippines frequently faced threats and violence because of their reporting,"" writes Abi Wright.
- Elections in Africa offered very different lessons in democracy and the press. While Burundian media played a major role in an election that led to the country's most representative government in years, Julia Crawford writes that, ""In Zimbabwe, the independent media have been so restricted by an increasingly repressive government that elections were no victory for democracy.""
- Throughout the world, CPJ staff identified new trouble spots: in Nepal, where a royal coup led to vast censorship; in Uzbekistan, where the massacre of citizens by government troops was followed by a brutal press crackdown; in Ethiopia, where journalists were put on a ""wanted list"" and jailed to quell dissent; and in Yemen, where a surge in violent attacks threatened the lively media.
Other important facts in CPJ's Attacks on the Press include:
- A total of 47 journalists were killed worldwide as a direct result of their work. More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in the line of duty in the last two years, making it the deadliest such period in a decade.
- Iraq was the most dangerous place for journalists in 2005, with 22 journalists killed in the line of duty. Iraq also became the deadliest war for journalists since CPJ was founded in 1981, surpassing the 58 killed between 1993 and 1996 in the Algerian conflict.
- Murder was the leading cause of work-related deaths among journalists. More than three-quarters of the journalists killed on duty were targeted for murder, continuing a long-term trend documented by CPJ.
- Continuing another trend, the killers of journalists usually go unpunished. In about 90 per cent of cases in 2005, CPJ found, the murders were carried out with impunity.
- A total of 125 journalists were imprisoned by 24 countries for their work, figures that reflected increases from the year before. Four countries account for more than two-thirds of the total: China with 32 journalists behind bars, Cuba with 24, Eritrea with 15, and Ethiopia with 13.
- In at least 78 cases, CPJ found, journalists were imprisoned on broad ""anti-state"" charges, such as sedition, subversion, divulging state s"

 The government's call for elections is a plot against the democratic forces, the Nepali Congress said today Friday 24 October . Addressing cadres at a tea party here Kathmandu , General Secretary of the NC Nepali Congress Party Sushil Koirala said, ""Elections are nothing but the government's ploy to lengthen its tenure."" Koirala wondered how polls could be possible at such a critical situation when the whole country was facing Maoists violence.
The Himalayan Times, Kathmandu, in English 25 Oct 03
Koirala also did not spare the Maoists for terrorising party cadres in the districts. He, however, urged the cadres to continue their fight against regression to establish democratic norms and values in the country. ""The movement against regression will not end unless the regression is reversed and the democratic system restored."" Koirala said while reiterating the party's demands for reinstating the House of Representatives.
 Much on the same line of logic of the five political parties, Koirala said the current imbroglio will come to an end after the parliament is restored and an all-party government formed. While the Nepali Congress has said restoration of the House of Representatives was a priority, the CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist has mainly been emphasizing on the formation of an all-party government which it claims would help re-establish the democratic system in the country.
 Koirala also said the democratic forces will ""not compromise"" with anybody for the sake of democracy. Indicating that the joint mass movement would be effectively resumed after the Chhat festival a festival popular among the people living in the southern plains or Terai region , Koirala said the movement would bring back people's rights.
 The NC has been under criticism from the other three small parties, especially the Janamorcha Nepal and the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party, for inviting the prime minister and other ministers during the tea party hosted by the NC during Dashain Hindu festival .

"5108",2006839,"Title: Nepal factions upbeat over talks.rtf; Date: October 8, 2006 Sunday 2:02 PM GMT; Text: Crucial peace negotiations between Nepal's government and Maoist rebels wrapped up on Sunday with both sides upbeat over the political process, with more talks scheduled for Tuesday.
""Today's meeting has ended inconclusively, but they were very positive talks,"" said Nepal's Tourism Minister Pradeep Gyawali, a member of the government team negotiating with the communist insurgents.
He said that during Sunday's nine-hour meeting, the two sides discussed ""the interim constitution, the role of monarchy, the interim legislature, arms management and the process to start constituent assembly elections.""
""We are hopeful that Tuesday's talks will finalise all these issues,"" the minister told AFP.
Maoist second-in-command Baburam Bhatterai shared the upbeat assessment.
""The talks were very positive and fruitful in the sense that we discussed all the important issues with the top leaders of the seven parties,"" he said, referring to the seven-member coalition government.
The latest negotiations, resuming after a four-month pause, are aimed at hammering out a new, temporary constitution that would bring the communist insurgents into the impoverished Himalayan kingdom's political mainstream.
The process has been slow-moving amid disputes over the future of Nepal's 238-year-old monarchy and what the rebels should do with their weapons.
The first meeting between Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and rebel leader Prachanda in June led to breakthrough plans for a temporary constitution to be drafted and for the Maoists to join a new interim government.
The temporary constitution remains unfinished because the ruling seven-party alliance is divided on such issues as whether the king should stay, go or take on a more symbolic role.
The second round of high-level talks had been scheduled for late September, but was postponed because the alliance could not reach a consensus.
Both sides have been observing a ceasefire for five months, after King Gyanendra was forced to end a 14-month period of direct rule.
Once foes, the rebels and political parties formed a loose alliance late last year, and organized the protests that forced Gyanendra's change.
Since Gyanendra's climbdown, the reinstated government has stripped him of most of his powers and removed his control of the 90,000-strong Nepal Army.
In addition, the multi-party government has agreed to constituent assembly elections to elect a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution permanently -- a key rebel demand.
""If need be, the Maoists could go back to war tomorrow, they still have the strategy and they have kept their cadres prepared for it,"" said Rhoderick Chalmers, the deputy South Asia project director of the International Crisis Group, an organization working to prevent conflict worldwide.
""But for now it is still the least attractive option for them,"" he said.

"1482",20044437,"Title: Nepal PM heads for India to seek further help tackling Maoist revolt.rtf; Date: September 8, 2004 Wednesday 5:10 PM GMT; Text: Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba arrived in India late Wednesday where he is expected to seek more help from New Delhi in tackling a deadly Maoist revolt racking his homeland.
His five-day official visit comes amid increased violence as the rebels step up their efforts to overthrow the monarchy and impose communist rule.
In their latest pressure tactic, the Maoists have vowed to force the closure Friday of 35 companies, including some Indian-run firms, on top of 12 they shut last month.
India, along with the United States and Britain, has been an important backer of Nepal in its drive to crush the insurgency that has cost at least 10,000 lives since 1996 and sapped the nation's already impoverished economy.
New Delhi has a vital stake in helping quell the revolt as it is worried Maoist violence could spill into parts of India where ultra-leftist groups are powerful and create ""a red corridor"" from Nepal.
India, which supplies weapons, military equipment and training to Nepal's ill-equipped security forces, shares a porous nearly 1,600-kilometer- (990-mile) long border with the Himalayan kingdom.
Deuba arrived late Wednesday in the Indian capital New Delhi, where he was met at the airport by India's junior foreign minister E. Ahmed.
He is also due to meet his Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Defence Minister P. Mukharji and other leaders.
""Prime Minister Deuba in his talks will be seeking India's cooperation to solve this Maoist problem, which is a problem for India also, including the supply of arms,"" junior foreign affairs minister Prakash Sharan Mahata said.
In a front page article headlined ""Maoist insurgency tops agenda,"" The Kathmandu Post, a leading daily, said Deuba was visiting India ""during what is arguably the most turbulent of times in the kingdom's history"".
Late Tuesday, suspected Maoists hurled three bombs at the gates of a luxury hotel in Kathmandu that is on a list of businesses the rebels' labour union arm has ordered to shut down.
The blasts at the Hotel Malla caused no injuries but were seen as a bid by the rebels to intimidate the businesses into obeying their shutdown order.
Analysts say many rebel orders are obeyed more out of fear of reprisals rather than support for the Maoist cause.
The rebel threat to close the businesses comes at awkward time for Deuba, whose 66-person entourage includes a dozen businesspeople and hopes to woo more Indian private investment. India is Nepal's biggest foreign investor and accounts for nearly 50 percent of overall trade.
The foreign ministry spokesman said Deuba would seek to reassure Indian business leaders that Nepal would provide ""adequate security"" to Indian companies operating in the country.
While the Maoists' chief accusation against the targeted companies is that they exploit workers -- charges the firms deny -- many of the businesses have Indian or US or British investment or are linked to Nepal's royal family.
The Hotel Malla has investment ties with the royal family while Dabur Nepal, a cosmetics and toiletries company run by Indian entrepreneurs, is also on the list of firms the rebels want to close down.
The Maoists, who already control vast areas of countryside, last month staged a week-long blockade of Kathmandu that they enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.

"2631",20043238,"Title: Cold wave kills 300 across South Asia, fog compounds misery in India.rtf; Date: January 3, 2004 Saturday; Text: A three-week cold front in parts of South Asia has killed at least 300 people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, with winter fog fracturing air, road and rail traffic, officials said on Saturday.
India's overall death toll rose to 215 as 10 more people died overnight in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the fog compounded misery by disrupting road and rail traffic, the Press Trust of India reported.
The latest deaths in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state of 125 million people, brought the state's cold wave toll to 146, it said.
In adjoining Bihar state, the chill has claimed 36 lives, with hundreds more hospitalised with cold-related diseases, the police said.
At least 13 people have died in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, where relief officials are reporting shortages of shelter for homeless people.
At least a further 20 people have been killed in vehicle accidents on northern Indian highways due to thick fog accompanying the winter weather.
Dense fog also continued to hit rail and road traffic on Saturday, with most trains running behind schedule by hours and hundreds of passengers stranded at various stations across northern India, a spokesman from the state-run utility said.
Weather-monitoring officials attribute the cold snap to westerly disturbances over the Himalayas which overlook Uttar Pradesh and the northern states of Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.
More than 80 people have died in the past five days in the cold snap gripping tropical Bangladesh, reports said on Saturday, as volunteers in the country handed out blankets and clothes to the homeless to help them keep warm.
The Daily Star newspaper said 51 people died had in the past three days in the south and northwestern parts of the country which normally swelters in tropical heat.
Fog accompanying the cold shrouded much of Bangladesh, disrupting local transportation, including vital ferry train services.
Homeless people in the impoverished nation used garbage for community bonfires, while volunteers distributed clothes and blankets to the poor, officials said.
Two infants froze to death in Nilphamari, near the country's northern tip where chill winds blow in from the Himalayas, the Star said.
The Himalayan state of Nepal reported at least five deaths from the current cold in the Himalayan region where low temperatures have brought snow and drizzle to the hills around the capital, Kathmandu.
""Sri Lanka and the Maldives have been spared by this cold wave,"" a spokesman from India's meteorological department told AFP in New Delhi.
Last winter's cold spell claimed 1,400 lives in India and scores in Bangladesh where homes are more suited to handling scorching summers during which temperatures can shoot up to 49 degrees Celcius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).

Guller was accompanied by four Nepalese high altitude Sherpa mountain guides, the ministry said, naming them as Sirdar Nim Dawa Sherpa, 40, Pem Tenji Sherpa, 39, Da Nima Sherpa, 31 and Namgya Sherpa, 32.
In the build-up to the event, Guller had led a group of people from the Coalition of Texans with Disabilities (CTD) group in a trek to Everest Base Camp in a bid, he said, to motivate them to achieve their dreams.
Earlier Friday, Sherpa Pemba Dorje smashed the record for the fastest climb from Base Camp to the summit of Everest, setting a time of 12 hours 45 minutes, the ministry announced.
The previous record was 16 hours 56 minutes, set in 2000 by legendary Sherpa Babu Chhiri who died after falling into a crevasse on Everest the following year.
Spurred on by Dorje's success, another Sherpa, Lhakpa Gelu Sherpa, would try this weekend to summit in an even faster time, mountaineering sources here said.
Lhakpa had made a speed record attempt earlier in the week but gave it up when the mountain was struck by poor weather conditons.
He has his sights set on breaking the 12-hour barrier, the sources said.

"7057",20082859,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists extend strong election lead.rtf; Date: April 13, 2008 Sunday 1:29 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoists on Sunday extended a stunning early lead in historic polls on the country's political future, election officials said as vote counting continued.
The trend has put the former rebels on track to become the single biggest bloc in a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution, and positioned to boot out the impoverished country's unpopular King Gyanendra and abolish the monarchy.
Of the 601 seats up for grabs in a new constitutional assembly, nearly one third have been decided or were close to being allocated -- with the former rebels taking or poised to win the lion's share.
""Groundswell for Maoists. People vote for change,"" headlined the Kathmandu Post newspaper, while according to the Himalayan Times, the Maoists were ""poised for landslide win.""
Local media said the Maoists, who fought a decade-long insurgency to oust the monarchy, had already won 59 seats -- about three times as many as their nearest rivals.
Nepal's election commission's official count had the Maoists winning 42 seats and ahead in 56 others.
The nearest competitors, the Nepali Congress and the centre-left Communist Party of Nepal, were ""far behind"" with only 13 and 14 seats respectively won so far, said Election Commission spokesman Laxman Bhattarai.
""By the looks of results so far, the Maoists will get a clear simple majority,"" said author and commentator Khagendra Sangroula, meaning the ultra-leftists will be the biggest party, but not an absolute majority.
""The whole power balance in Nepali political dynamics will change. Maoists will lead the government.""
The April 10 election were a central plank of a 2006 peace deal under which the Maoists agreed to end the civil war -- which left at least 13,000 people dead -- and enter mainstream politics.
For Sangroula, the poll results point to a resounding vote for ""new ideas, alternatives, new faces and possibilities.""
""This way it looks like the monarchy will go,"" he said.
Rhoderick Chalmers, Nepal's country director for the Belgium-based think-tank the International Crisis Group, agreed that the Maoists were on track to become the biggest party.
""They are doing very well in the first-past-the-post system, which has surprised even them,"" said Chalmers.
""They could end up getting between 30 to 40 percent of the total seats in the assembly,"" Chalmers said. ""They are clearly going to be the strongest party.""
Of the 601 seats, 240 are appointed on a first-past-the-post system, and it is those results which are currently being tallied.
Another 335 assembly members will be elected by proportional representation -- a counting method the Maoists are also expected to do well in. The full results for those seats could take several weeks to emerge.
The final 26 seats will be appointed by a new interim government to be formed after the polls, in which the Maoists will also naturally be well represented.
The election commission said the vote count was going well, despite some gloomy predictions ahead of the polls that the elections and count would quickly give way to angry disputes and violence.
""We have no problems in the counting process. We are satisfied with how the election process is going,"" Bhattarai said.
The Maoists -- still classed as a terrorist organisation by the US State Department -- have placed their militia in UN-monitored camps.
""The people have given us the benefit of the doubt because we come from a different background than the rest of the parties,"" Ananta, the deputy head of the ""People's Liberation Army,"" told AFP.
""We were portrayed as a party that didn't have much influence or general support. We have proved all the people that said that wrong,"" said Ananta.

"4126",20053336,"Title: India in contact with _all the actors_ in Nepal - foreign secretary.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 17, 2005 Thursday
Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com website on 17 November
New Delhi, 16 November: In a candid revelation, Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran said here on Wednesday [16 November] that India has been carefully monitoring the situation in Nepal, while remaining in contact with ""all the actors"" in the kingdom's political crisis.
""The stakes for India [in Nepal's crisis] are extremely high. So we are carefully monitoring the situation. We are engaged with Nepal, we are engaged with all the actors in Nepal's crisis - the monarchy and the political parties,"" Saran, a former ambassador to Kathmandu, said.
He was speaking after the launching of a book - The Royal Nepal Army (RNA): Meeting the Maoist Challenge - by retired Indian Army Gorkha officer Maj-Gen Ashok Kumar Mehata, at the think-tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF) here.
Saran, however, didn't specify whether his government was also engaged with the rebel Maoist leaders, as is widely believed after the parleys in May last between Indian Left leaders and Maoist emissaries led by CPN [Communist Party of Nepal]-Maoist No 2 leader Dr Babu Ram Bhattarai.
Hard on the heels of the meeting between King Gyanendra and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the just-concluded Dhaka SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] summit, Saran said his government was monitoring the ""evolution of the situation"".
""There's an optimistic scenario, but there's also a pessimistic scenario,"" he said.
At a time when civil society and political leaders in Nepal and India are debating the role of constitutional monarchy in modern Nepal, Saran made it clear that there may be a role for the monarchy.
""Monarchy can still be a constructive force, and a unifying symbol in Nepal, if it so chooses to,"" he said, hoping that this institution does not participate in ""the pell-mell of the everyday problem"".
Speaking about the role of the RNA in conflict resolution and transformation in Nepal, he fondly recalled his days as Indian envoy to Kathmandu not so long ago, and said, ""RNA is changing (and modernizing) gradually. It can create a space that's needed to bring about a fundamental change.""
He, however, ruled out the possibility of a military solution to the crisis when he said, ""It's a war which cannot be won by military means alone.""
Earlier in the day, Saran also discussed the evolving political situation in Nepal with visiting Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala.
Later, Koirala, who is here on his second medical trip in less than five months, also held talks with Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil.

Top opposition leaders were among the 300 people arrested. About three dozen people were hurt, with some suffering head injuries, hospital officials said, when police beat them in an attempt to disperse the crowd of more than 6,000 gathered in the capital.
Police dragged about 300 protesters to police vans and trucks and drove them to detention centers.
The rally, led by top opposition leaders from Nepal's seven largest political parties, moved into the city center despite a government ban on gatherings there. The protesters broke through police lines, chanting slogans against the royal government.
""Down with autocracy! We want democracy! Give back power to the people!"" the protesters shouted.
Protesters hurled rocks and bricks, injuring two police officers. One witness said a radio journalist covering the event also was beaten by police.
Protesters demanding the restoration of democracy in this Himalayan nation have held daily rallies in Katmandu over the past week to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power earlier this year. Tuesday's rally was the largest.
Seven major political parties have vowed to continue protests until the king gives up power and restores democracy.
The monarch said he was compelled to assume power to quell a communist insurgency, which has claimed more than 11,500 lives in nine years, and to end government corruption.
Nepali Congress, the country's largest political party, said its top leaders - including Ram Chandra Poudel, Susil Koirala and Ram Sharan Mahat - were arrested.
The Communist Party of Nepal, the second-largest party, said its leader, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and other top officials were detained.
It was unclear when they would be freed or if they would face criminal charges. Police officials said they were waiting for orders.

 The two-day meeting reviewed security escort arrangements for Bhutanese travellers and decided that restrictions on the movement of Bhutanese vehicles and people without security escorts through West Bengal will be lifted.
 The meeting agreed that the Rangia-Tamalpur-Samdrupjongkhar road, the Santabari-Gelephu road, the Barabisa-Kalikhola road, and the Patshala-Nganglam roads will be repaired and upgraded.

  According to reports, the curfew has been imposed to prevent a planned anti-King rally that was called by the seven-member opposition alliance in protest against the government's plans to hold local elections next month. 
  Over 100 opposition leaders, human rights and civil society activists have been detained. Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala and CPN-UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal have been placed under house arrest. 
  Former Prime Minister Koirala, who was planning to lead today's rally has been confined to his house in Maharajgunj and is being guarded by security personnel. 
  Last Monday, the Nepal Government had banned the holding of rallies anywhere in Kathmandu after a Maoist attack last weekend, saying anti-monarchy Maoist guerrillas could infiltrate such gatherings and spark trouble.
  Twelve policemen were killed in the Maoist attack last weekend.
  However, the seven-party opposition alliance has vowed to go ahead with the protests despite an indefinite ban on public gatherings. 
  The last time a daytime curfew was imposed in the capital was when King Gyanendra sacked the government and assumed full executive powers on February 1, 2005. 
  The Ministry of External Affairs of India has expressed its concern over the ongoing political developments in Nepal.
  ""These actions of His Majesty's Government of Nepal are regrettable and a matter of grave concern to all those who wish to see the constitutional forces in Nepal working together to achieve peace and stability in the country,"" a Ministry of External Affairs media release had said on Thursday.
  The European Union has also voiced its concern over the arrests in Nepaland said it was urgently considering the implications of the government move. 
  All telephone and mobile services have been cut off in Kathmandu.
  The opposition parties have been holding protests over King Gyanendra's seizure of executive powers in February last year. The Maoist rebels also have vowed to disrupt the municipal polls, and have warned that they will step up their attacks against government targets in the run-up to the polls. 
  More than 12,000 people have died in Nepal since the Maoists began their insurgency 10 years ago. 
  On January 2, the Maoists ended a four-month unilateral ceasefire, saying the government had failed to match it, and vowed to take their revolt from the countryside into the cities. At least 45 people have died since then.

They were released by immigration officials from Dilli Bazaar Jail in Kathmandu, but picked up by the police, Wangchuk Tshering, head of the Tibetan Welfare Centre, told AFP.
Twenty-one Tibetans were arrested here in mid-April after entering Nepal en route to Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama and other leading Tibetan figures live in exile.
Three of them were young children who were handed over to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), according to an immigration official here.
The others, including eight aged younger than 16, were detained and ordered to pay fines of up to 64 dollars each.
On Thursday, Tibetan activists said they faced deportation to Tibet after the intervention of Chinese officials and faced being sent to concentration camps as punishment for fleeing Tibet.
""These destitute Tibetans are now detained at the local police cell at Hanuman Dhoka and it is not immediately known whether they will be deported to Tibet or to India,"" Wangchuk said.
He said about 100 Tibetan refugees living in Nepal had gathered outside the jail.
The head of the Immigration Department Shubarna, Lal Shrestha, denied that the Tibetans had been handed over to Chinese embassy officials.
""These 18 Tibetans detained in a local jail for over a month were released Thursday,"" he said.
UNHCR official Giulia Ricciarelli-Ranawat said they had asked the Nepalese government to hand the Tibetans over to them.
""We have appealed to the Nepalese government that they should not be handed over to the Chinese authorities.""
There are between 30,000 and 35,000 Tibetan refugees settled in Nepal, but the kingdom is careful not to anger Beijing and has refused to let the Dalai Lama visit.
The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize three decades later for his non-violent opposition to Beijing's presence in Tibet.

"5186",20064261,"Title: Nepal 's home minister says everything else peripheral to constituent assembly.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: June 10, 2006 Saturday
Excerpt from interview with Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula by Kishor Sapkota and Jayaram Subedi, published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 10 June
[Sitaula was part of the taskforce of the seven parties that charted out the plan for the people's movement. He also played an active role in effecting the 12-point understanding between the seven parties and the Maoists]
[Question] After the first talks, there has been no sign of second talks. Has the talks process been disrupted?
[Sitaula] All issues cannot be solved through formal talks only. Even now, discussions and dialogue between the state and the Maoists, parties and the Maoists, and civil society and the Maoists are going on. Talks have not been stalled. There are issues that require informal multilateral discussions. The concern of all of us is how to institutionalize democracy and establish peace in the country.
[Q] The cease-fire code of conduct issued through talks is not being implemented. How can this tradition of reaching an agreement and not implementing it provide a way out [of the crisis]?
[Sitaula] We have reached an agreement to form a monitoring committee soon so as to ensure that the cease-fire code of conduct is not violated. We must be able to pay attention to the implementation of the code of conduct and put it into practice. I don't think there is any significant weakness on the part of the state on this score. A lot remains to be done by the Maoists. Maoists are yet to return houses and lands seized by them. Nonetheless, I am confident that they will solve all these issues. I don't want to express any mistrust towards Maoists.
[Q] When will the second talks be held?
[Sitaula] A formal decision has not been taken as regards the timing of the second talks. We will fix the date for talks once we reach a conclusion, through informal talks, on how to move ahead.
[Q] An agreement to urge the United Nations to monitor the cease-fire code of conduct was made public. What is it bogged down in?
[Sitaula] We have talked about national-international monitoring. It is still under process of discussion.
[Q] The code of conduct says both sides will not do anything provocative. The statements made by the leaderships of both sides are provocative in nature. Why is it so?
[Sitaula] We must also analyse how accurately the statements are being reported. There is no need to panic about possible incitement just because of some statements. It is not that problems will be created when political party leaders simply express views as per their respective party line. But what is certain is that the more restraint and politeness we exercise the more it will help to solve the problem. Words of provocation and arrogance can definitely create mutual misconception. So, as far as possible, [we] must present ourselves exercising restraint, politeness and tolerance, and must give such a message while talking among the people. This is the need of the day because at times, statements can incite and disrupt. We must pay attention to this point.
[Q] The Maoists' reaction to the declaration of the House of Representatives has been the charge that the parliamentary parties are trying to take all the credit and are being bogged down in petty and trivial issues by abandoning the main agenda. Why is mistrust increasing?
[Sitaula] The Maoists may have aired such a view on the grounds that the parliament, which does not host the Maoists, took a unilateral decision, without asking them. It does contain some sentimental argument and logic. But the decisions taken by the parliament are totally committed to the country, people and democracy. The Maoists should not have much reservations over it, but if the session of House of Representative is prolonged till eternity and the Maoists' aspirations and statements are not given due recognition, then it won't be an appropriate decision. [passage omitted: says Maoists and parties must give up their obduracy]
[Q] In short, are the functions of the parliament and the all-inclusive conference demanded by the Maoists the same?
[Sitaula] The functions are the same. We must demonstrate the capacity to link the two.
[Q] There is also a suspicion that the government will step back from constituent assembly. Will elections really take place?
[Sitaula] Constituent assembly election is the main agenda of this government. After making constituent assembly election the main agenda, the other works of the government are peripheral. The government's entire focus is on when and how soon a constituent assembly election can be held. The whole parliament has decided to go for constituent assembly polls, the Maoists have decided the same, all the people of the country desire it. No one should have any doubts about that.
[Q] When will the date for constituent assembly polls be announced?
[Sitaula] The sooner an interim government is formed, the sooner the date for constituent assembly polls wi"

Capt. Charie Vigilant, the force's press attach said on Tuesday in Entebbe, some 40 km south of Ugandan capital city of Kampala that the 1,500 troops would be out of Bunia by Sept. 1 and will fly out of Entebbe Airbase by Sept. 15.
The 1,500 force has been in Bunia, the commercial capital of Ituri region since June.
The European force set a logistics base at the Entebbe Airbase in June.  The airbase is now busy as the soldiers prepare to ship out and their hardware could be seen at the airbase, according to the report.
About 2,000 United Nations peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay and Bangladesh, are already in Bunia. Pakistani and Nepalese troops are expected to bring the total to 4,700 in September.
However, the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to authorize the French-led force to stay in eastern Congo longer and assist UN peacekeepers scheduled to take over on Sept. 1.
Under the resolution approved by the 15-member council, the French-led multinational force would be ready to provide emergency help to the UN peacekeepers if necessary. The disengagement of the French-led force should last until Sept. 15 at the latest, the resolution said.
The war in RDC began in August 1988, when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into the country to back rebels seeking to topple then- President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia then sent forces to prop up the Kinshasa government.
Violence between the ethnic majority Lendu and minority Hema people has claimed an estimated 50,000 lives since 1999 and displaced a million others.

Scientists and experts from Australia, Bangladesh, Central Asia, China, Finland, France, India, Mekong Region, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sweden and Britain will participate in the conference beginning Friday.
The conference named 'River Waters: Perspectives and Challenges for Asia' aims at establishing a transparent dialogue and cooperation amongst Asian states for managing water resources.
The conference has been organised by the Foundation for Non-violent Alternatives (FNVA), a think tank.
Asia is the world's driest continent where the availability of fresh water is not even half the global annual average of 6,380 cubic metres per inhabitant.
Experts predict that the water situation will only exacerbate, leading to serious implications for economic growth and inter-riparian relations.
Way back in 1995, Ismail Serageldin, then a senior vice president of World Bank, had prophesied: 'The next World War will be over water.'
Already, India is having water disputes with Pakistan and Bangladesh and has concerns over China's dam-building over the Brahmaputra river.
'To avoid conflicts it is imperative to initiate processes of putting in place modalities and mechanisms for trans-boundary governance of water resources,' said a concept note by the FNVA Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

    ""This is a consultation meeting, which takes place once in  every two years, to review the ongoing projects and also identify  new areas for development cooperation,"" said an under secretary at the Foreign Aid Coordination Division at Nepal's Ministry of  Finance. He said the meeting would concentrate on the projects'  progress, and Middle Marsyangdi would be a central agenda. The  last meeting was held in 2004.
    According to a source at Middle Marsyangdi Project Office, the  concerned officials on Monday went to the Nepal Electricity  Authority to discuss the problems faced by the project. The  project is already three years behind schedule, and is expected to be completed only by the end of 2007. On the other hand, the total project cost has gone up from the estimated 13 billion rupees (one U.S. dollar is about 72 rupees) to over 26 billion rupees.
    The bilateral consultation will review other German funded  projects in the areas of health, local development, industry, and  science and technology. The German delegation, headed by Wolfgang  Kanera, the Head of the South Asia Division of the German Federal  Ministry for Development Cooperation and Assistance, is arriving  in Kathmandu on Nov. 26.
    According to Tanka Lal Shrestha, an official at the embassy of  the Federal Republic of Germany in Kathmandu, the meeting will  largely focus on ""monitoring and reviewing the ongoing projects""  and also identifying possibilities of new projects.
    Asked if there were any probability of Germany coming up with  development aid in any new field in the changed context of Nepal,  Shrestha said, ""The government of Nepal should identify its  priority for the Germany to think about any new projects."" So far, Germany has not pledged any separate financial assistance for the  peace process of Nepal.
    Nepal's Ministry of Finance had recently held a meeting with  donors seeking assistance of more than 5 billion rupees to be  spent for constructing seven designated cantonments for  disarmament and rehabilitation of the armed personnel of the  Communist Party of Nepal (formerly known as guerilla), for  rehabilitation of the internally displaced People, to strengthen  the police administration for enhancing internal security, and for holding the elections to the constituent assembly.

  In fact, the email claim that Lashkar-e-Qahar, a lesser-known terror outfit, was behind the blasts had been sent one of the three.
  Resident of Malegaon, 19-year-old Shariq Ahmed Khan had gone to Bhopal especially for this purpose. The email -- that claimed the outfit had sent 16 bombers and one had died in the Mahim blast -- had been sent to a news channel from a cyber cafe in Bhopal.
  Khan was produced in a metropolitan court on Wednesday after being brought from Bhopal on a transfer warrant. He has been remanded to Crime Branch custody till September 19. Besides Khan, two other SIMI members were arrested -- 38-year-old Shabbir Ahmed Mushiullah from Malegaon and 29year-old Nafees Ahmed Ansari from Govandi.
  The two had allegedly visited Pakistan twice since 2003 and have been actively involved in SIMI activities. A raid at their residence, Crime Branch sources say, led to the discovery of ""objectionable and inflammatory"" Islamic literature and pamphlets.
  According to the police, the duo used the porous Indo-Nepal border to reach Pakistan.
  Police say the two men had been ""indoctrinated"" by Malegaon's SIMI chief Munawwar Ahmed Amin after the Gujarat riots. They were allegedly persuaded to avenge the ""atrocities committed during the riots"".

With the weather office warning there will be no respite before the end of the week, police in New Delhi overnight rounded up homeless people and took them to special shelters, an official said.
More deaths, meanwhile, were reported from India's northern Uttar Pradesh state, bringing the toll in the state to 124 and the countrywide toll to 160, according to a tally based on figures released by police and officials.
In Pakistan, major cities as well the country's earthquake-battered areas have been gripped by one of the most severe cold snaps of the last 30 years, meteorological officials said.
More than 30 people are reported to have died from cold-related diseases in the northern Himalayan regions outside the quake zone during the past week, UN and health officials said.
At least 14 people in Nepal have died since the cold weather swept in at the weekend, state radio said.
Temperatures in Pakistan's mountain town of Skardu plummeted to minus 13 Celsius (8.6 Fahrenheit) overnight, Muhammad Saeed, deputy director of Pakistan's Meteorological department told AFP.
Across the country temperatures are three or four degrees lower than average, he added. Last week the eastern city of Lahore had its coldest day in 39 years when the mercury hit minus two degrees Celsius.
Primary schools in north India, meanwhile, have been ordered closed while officials in New Delhi, where the temperatures dipped to a 70-year low of 0.2 degrees Celsius (32.36 Fahrenheit) on Sunday, have warned the elderly and young children to stay indoors.
Srinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, recorded minus three degrees Celsius (26.6 degrees Fahrenheit) Tuesday, while the northern Sikh pilgrimage city of Amritsar recorded zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).
A doctor in Uri, one of the towns in Indian Kashmir worst affected by a devastating earthquake three months ago, warned that survivors living in makeshift shelters are showing signs of hypothermia and frostbite.
""We have started receiving people with frost bite, pneumonia and other cold-related diseases,"" said Bashir Chalko, who feared the situation would get worse the longer the cold conditions continue.
Earthquake-hit areas in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and North West Frontier Province, meanwhile, are likely to receive more snowfall between January 14 and 19, weather official Saeed said.
Blizzards and heavy rain over the New Year collapsed or flooded hundreds of survivors' tents in the devastated region.
""It is still very cold here in my tent, but when I think about those in mountain villages who have snow all around their tents I wonder how they are surviving,"" said Akram Shah, a labourer in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir.
The October 8 earthquake killed nearly 74,000 people, severely injured about the same number and left around 3.5 million people homeless just weeks before the start of the bitter Himalayan winter.
The 7.6-magnitude quake killed at least another 1,300 people in Indian Kashmir and left more than 150,000 homeless.
The World Health Organisation said last week that up to 19 people in the quake zone had died of pneumonia over the past six weeks but that this was a normal mortality rate for the time of year.
Even tropical Bangladesh has not escaped the cold, with temperatures falling as low as 8.1 degrees centigrade (46.58 Fahrenheit) in parts of the normally-sweltering country.
A thick blanket of fog enveloped parts of the country Tuesday, disrupting travel plans of millions of Bangladeshis on the move ahead of the Eid al-Adha festival, officials said.

Excerpt from report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)
Beijing, 1 July: When China opened the first railway linking Tibet with the rest of the country on Saturday [1 July], a group of Tibetologists cheered for an extended ""living space"" the "" engineering marvel"" will bring to the splendid, unique Tibetan culture.
""The influx of tourists will not only bring revenue into the region but will also lead to more cultural exchanges between Tibet and other parts of China,"" said research fellow An Caidan with China Tibetology Research Centre (CTRC), the country's largest academic institution for Tibetan studies.
The development of the traffic network in Tibet means more opportunities for cultural exchanges between different ethnic groups in China, making it possible for Tibetan culture to be better inherited and enriched, said Dazhag, curator of the Museum of Tibet Autonomous Region.
Tibetan culture's full bloom between the seventh and ninth centuries was partly a result of extensive cultural exchanges between the ethnic group and others, An said.
According to the expert, the traditional Tibetan calendar combined calendar systems of India and other ethnic groups of China, its forging technologies absorbed Nepalese technics, and its medicine took in traditional Chinese medical science.
Tibetan's life style will inevitably change after the railway begins operation, said Huang Fukai, a member of the Chinese Association of Protection and Development on Tibetan Culture.
""They may have coffee and bread in addition to the traditional buttered tea and zanba,"" he said. Zanba is roasted highland barley flour.
Jeans and suits might also be welcomed by Tibetans, he added.
However, An Caidan said, such changes are a matter of course in the development of civilization. ""Some people may criticize that Tibetan culture will be killed, but this is rather biased, as Tibetan people have the right to share modern civilization.""
Ye Xingsheng, a CTRC research fellow who lived in Tibet for 42 years, said he is satisfied that the central and regional governments have invested heavily in cultural relics protection in Tibet and placed environmental protection on the top of its agenda in building the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.
He called for more efforts to protect Tibetan culture as ""it is hard to have traditions again when you lose them.""
The experts' ideas on the future of the Tibetan culture are echoed by Norbu Toinzhub, mayor of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
""The Tibetan culture has had ties with other cultures in its development process. Only with constant exchanges, reforms and development shall a culture have a stronger vitality,"" the mayor said.
""Tourists admire the Tibetan culture because it is unique. The Tibetan culture will not disappear when there is market demand for it,"" he said.
""The Tibetan culture will not have fundamental changes with the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. On the contrary, it has a bright future,"" the official said. [passage omitted]

Bista, who was among the new dozen of ministers named from the ruling Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist by the government Monday night after weeks of vacillating, sustained injuries on the head and in his left hand as he was attacked close to his own residence soon after the nominations.
Party sources said Bista, a diabetic, was going out for his habitual evening walk when his mobile phone rang and congratulatory messages started pouring in. He was striding past his house in the Samakhushi area of Kathmandu while talking on the phone when two men drove past on a motorcycle. The pillion rider hacked at the minister with a khukuri, the sharp carved knife that is the favourite battle weapon of the Gurkha soldiers. As the started minister put his hands up to guard his head, the knife came down heavily on the left hand, causing a deep gash.
The two men fled the scene immediately and till late afternoon, despite Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal's assurance to Bista's family that the attackers would be caught and punished, police had been unable to make any arrests. The audacious attempt came a day after two more motorcycle-borne assailants shot dead Indian businessman Anjani Kumar Chachan in his own shop in one of the busiest commercial areas of the capital.
Bista would have to shoulder a heavy load once he takes the oath office on Wednesday. Most of the hit and run murders in the capital have been committed during power outages. Due to an unprecedented energy crisis, Nepal has been reeling under a 14-hour daily power cut.
The expansion of the eight-member cabinet to 20 ministers comes as n act of defiance by the Nepali prime minister after his sole coalition partner, the Maoists, continued to fight over the allocation of portfolios, demanding the home ministry and refusing to send any more ministers till the demand was met. Currently, the former rebels have only for ministers in the cabinet.

""Get rid of the royal regime. We want a republic state,"" chanted the rebels and their supporters as they began their march from six different points on the outskirts of the capital and merged at the grounds.
Although the rebels helped oust Gyanendra's authoritarian government in April, they are calling for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution.
""We will continue our struggle, but we will achieve all our goals through peaceful means,"" said Prasanta, a senior rebel leader whose actual name is Janardan Sharma.
The police banned big vehicles, including buses and trucks, from entering the city limits and all vehicles around the venue. A thick line of policemen in riot gear protected the royal palace and Singhadurabar, the walled complex with the prime minister's office and most ministries.
Rebel volunteers in red T-shirts were posted at the major intersection, directing both traffic and pedestrians.
Though Friday is a religious holiday in Katmandu, the extra flow of traffic and people from outside the capital made the situation chaotic. News reports said the rebels seized hundreds of buses in other cities to ferry their supporters to Katmandu.
After joining forces to topple King Gyanendra's authoritarian government in April, the ruling alliance and the country's Maoist rebels appeared close to a solution to the decade-long civil war that has killed more than 13,000 people.
However, rebel spokesman Krishna Mahara on Thursday said the government's deployment of soldiers to major cities across Nepal in recent days violated a pledge with the rebels and could lead to a return to war.
""The government is trying to push the country back to conflict,"" Mahara told reporters on Thursday.
He said the government was trying to reinstate old village councils in areas where the rebels had previously disbanded them.
Government troops were also back on the streets patrolling, manning checkpoints on highways and even beating up some rebels, he said.
""This is against the code of conduct the sides have signed saying armed soldiers or fighters will not be mobilized,"" Mahara said.
Nepal's army said soldiers have been deployed in recent days in Katmandu and other major cities to help combat rising crime.
The rebels and government have agreed to hold a second round of peace talks, but a date has not yet been set.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to establish a communist state.
Since both sides announced a cease-fire, they have held one round of peace talks last month in Katmandu.
Meanwhile, King Gyanendra made his first public appearance on Friday since he was forced to give up power in April. He drove to the southern edge of the capital to take part in a chariot festival. His motorcade and the route were well guarded by the security forces.

"3037",20041782,"Title: Newly-merged Indian Maoist group says not ready for cease-fire.rtf; Date: October 14, 2004, Thursday; Text: Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
 Hyderabad, 14 October: India's two major left extremist groups, Peoples War Group PWG and Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) Thursday 14 October announced they have merged and floated the Communist Party of India (Maoist) outfit, but said the new entity was not ready for a cease-fire.
 The extremists' public announcement came a day before they were to hold discussion with the Andhra Pradesh government, after the government initiated negotiations with them. ""The merger took place on 21 September. We will be going to the talks with our new identity of CPI (Maoists),"" said state secretary of former PWG Ramakrisha in this capital of southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 1739 gmt 14 Oct 04
""Except Andra Pradesh, there is no possibility of talks with any other state government, including West Bengal,"" said Gadai Naskar, central committee member of the newly-formed party, in the eastern metropolis of Kolkata. ""By going to the talks, we are not declaring any cease-fire. It is necessary both for us and the Andhra Pradesh government to talk. We are going to the parleys at the demand of the masses while the government wants us to adopt parliamentary democracy,"" he told newsmen. ""Talks are a part of our tactical line, extremism is not a problem, it is a solution,"" Naskar said.
 Left extremist elements are active along the eastern belt of the country in West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand states, as also in Andhra Pradesh, and have been carrying on armed confrontation with the government for many past years.
 No decision was taken yet on whether Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and Janashakti, the other two groups involved in the talks, would join the new outfit, Ramakrishna said, but added that efforts were on to consolidate all extremist splinter groups on one platform. He said the immediate task would be to build up the ""people's army"" and base areas by intensifying the current ""agrarian revolutionary guerrilla war"" throughout the country.
 For this purpose, he said, it had been decided to convert 14 ""guerrilla zones"" in different districts into ""base areas"", including in Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chattishgarh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Karnataka.
 Naskar said CPI(M) had become a revisionist party after the split of the undivided Communist Party and there was no basis for talks with the Left Front government headed by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in West Bengal.
 Denying there was any Maoist corridor from Dandakaranya to Nepal, Ramakrishna said, ""We are sympathetic to the Maoist struggle in Nepal and condemn the moves of Indian government to send equipment to that country.""
 MCC, which has a strong base in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, would jointly undertake a state-wide mass contact programme to explain the reasons for the merger and hold a public meeting in Hyderabad on 16 November in which leaders from various states will take part.

 Patna, April 3 -- The traffic on the Patna-Gaya section of the East Central Railway resumed on Monday morning after the banned CPI Maoists lifted the siege of Nadaul railway station in Patna district, nearly two hours after seizing it last night. 
  The railway station, about 30 km from here, was sieged at around 10.30 p.m. on the night of Sunday by heavily armed Maoists who first chased away the station master Rajesh Kumar and other staffs.
  However, according to Chief Public Relations Officer AK Chandra, nobody was found when the police reached the spot past midnight and normal traffic resumed.
  Meanwhile, one company of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and a platoon of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) have been deployed at Nadaul and a search operation to nab the Maoists has been launched.
  The banned Maoists have intensified their attack on trains and railway stations in last few months. In March, armed activists of Communist Party of India (Maoist) had hijacked Barwadih-Mugalsarai passenger train in Jharkhand after attacking the driver in Latehar district
  Last year on November 13, the CPI (Maoist) rebels had attacked the Jehanabad sub-jail in Bihar, and freed nearly 400 inmates, including some naxalite leaders. 
  States like Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkand and Bihar are some of the worst naxal-affected regions. 
  The insurgency, named after the town of Naxalbari, where it emerged in 1967, has affected 165 of the country's 602 administrative districts in a ""red corridor"" stretching from the southern tip of India all along its eastern half and up to Nepal. 
  Police say there are more than 20, 000 armed Maoist rebels in India backed by hundreds of thousands of supporters. 
  In February, naxalites stole 19 tonnes of explosives from a state mining operation in Chattisgarh, and killed more than 50 people when they set off a landmine under a truck.

"485",20031726,"Title: Former Nepal PM threatens to expose 'design' behind royal massacre.rtf; Date: January 2, 2003 Thursday; Text: Former prime minister of Nepal Girija Prasad Koirala has threatened to expose what he said was a 'grand design' behind the 2001 massacre which left 10 members of the royal family dead, a report said Thursday.
""I deliberately choose to keep shut but I will expose everything at an opportune time,"" he was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post at a public meeting in the southeastern town of Janakpur on Wednesday.
""The time is not far away,"" he added.
King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya and seven other royals were gunned down on June 1 2001.
An official investigation found that a drunk Crown Prince Dipendra had carried out the shootings, before killing himself.
The massacre shocked the world and was seen as a calamity by the people of the Himalayan kingdom, many of whom revere the king as an incarnation of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu.
When Birendra's brother Gyanendra took over the throne shortly afterwards people protested on the streets.
Koirala said he had been keeping quiet over the issue fearing that it would trigger fresh unrest, according to the Kathmandu Post.
Koirala also criticised Gyanendra, who in October sacked the elected prime minister who had dissolved parliament to hold mid-term elections. The king then installed an interim government and indefinitely postponed the polls.
""The king still has the chance to make a correction to the constitutional process by reviving the parliament,"" Koirala told the meeting.
""The constitution of Nepal stipulates that elections must be conducted within six months of the dissolution of parliament, and it goes without saying that the dissolution is subject to either timely elections or restoration of the House of Representatives,"" he said.

 Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times web site on 21 January
 Kathmandu, 20 January: In what is the biggest drug haul yet this year by the anti-drug agency, its sleuths raided an organized drug racket safe house in the capital and seized 67 kg of charas hashish last night. A manhunt is on for the kingpin of the crime ring.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 21 Jan 05The seizure was made after sleuths of the Narcotic Drug Control Law Enforcement Unit raided a house in Gwarko, Lalitpur, following the arrest of Bhoj Bahadur Ale in New Baneswor. ""Our sleuths were chasing the drug-pushers for over two weeks,"" said acting senior superintendent of police, Hemant Malla, adding that the huge quantity of the drug could have been in the pipeline to meet the peak season demand in the Western market.
 Ale, who is being interrogated, was arrested with 19 kg of charas just before the haul. The house in Gwarko where the sleuths made the seizure was found to be fully equipped with hashish processing equipment, indicating the presence of a flourishing organized ring.
 Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Dibash Raj Udash said, ""We are hoping to nab the big fish behind the ring. Ale can lead us to them. Preliminary investigation has given us hope."" Udash said Ale could face a prison sentence ranging from two to 10 years and a fine ranging from 15,000 to 100,000 rupees, adding that that the penalty for dealing in drugs was stringent. The DSP expressed satisfaction at the police team's success in the raid and action taken by the team. The latest haul has come close on the heels of the one last month in which 43 kg of hashish were recovered from drug peddlers in Boudha.

"818",20033099,"Title: Journalists killed while on the job last year are being memorialized(2).rtf; Date: May 2, 2003, Friday, BC cycle; Text: The names of 31 journalists who died covering the news around the world last year were added to a rainbow-hued glass memorial Friday.
The father of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan, said the lost reporters represent ""the ultimate strength of open society as well as its ultimate vulnerability.""
Judea Pearl said his son was killed ""not for what he wrote or planned to write but for what he represented.""
""To his killers,"" Pearl said, ""he represented the ideas that every person in every civilized society aspires to uphold - modernity, openness, pluralism, freedom of inquiry, truth and respect for all people.""
Joe Urschel, executive director of the Newseum, said 17 of the 31 journalists were targeted because of their profession.
""In many cases, they knew that their efforts to get close to the story placed them in danger,"" Urschel said during an annual ceremony to rededicate the memorial, which has a sweeping view of Washington across the Potomac River.
Last year's deaths brings to 1,475 the toll of reporters, photographers, broadcasters and other journalists who died as a result of injury or illness while covering the news, from 1812 to 2002. As the sun painted a rainbow of colors across the spiraling glass memorial Friday morning, journalists and family members read each name aloud.
Already, names are mounting for next year's service.
At least a dozen journalists died while covering the war in Iraq, and two more are missing, said Susan Bennett, director of international exhibits for the Freedom Forum's Newseum. The foundation, dedicated to free speech and free press, maintains the journalists memorial, adding the previous year's names each May.
Names of the war dead, including NBC News reporter David Bloom, Atlantic Monthly editor-at-large Michael Kelly and Associated Press Television News cameraman Nazeh Darwazeh, will be embedded between glass panes in 2004.
Journalists killed in 2002 included a newspaper editor and a broadcaster who were shot in separate incidents in Colombia; both had received death threats. In Russia, attacks on two editors and a reporter were linked to their investigative reporting. Journalists in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal and the Philippines also appear to have been killed because of their work, the foundation said.
Two journalists died in gunfire while covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One was struck by a U.S. tank during military exercises in Kuwait. Others died in Papua New Guinea, Uganda and Venezuela.
Alongside Pearl, Americans on this year's list are:
-Larry Greene, 50, a photographer with KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, killed in a Navy helicopter crash in the North Arabian Gulf.
-Photographer David Gerdrum, 48, and reporter Jennifer Hawkins Hinderliter, 22, killed in a traffic accident on assignment for KRTV in Great Falls, Mont.
-Freelance reporter Robert I. Friedman, 51, who died of heart complications resulting from a rare disease contracted while reporting in Bombay, India.

"6951",20083231,"Title: Nepal Maoist leader rules out possibility of talks with armed groups.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: November 12, 2008 Wednesday
Text of report published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 12 November
Maoist central leader and former minister Matrika Yadav has said that the government was just trumpeting about the talks with different armed groups. The talks will not take place as long as Bam Dev Gautam is the home minister, he added.
Speaking to journalists in the capital [Kathmandu] yesterday, the Maoist leader said there was no progress on talks and the present government negotiation team will be unable to accomplish the task.
""The government is only spreading propaganda of talks. Until there is an Indian national in the negotiation panel and Home Minister Gautam acts and speaks against the talks, there is not going to be any talks,"" he said.
Though the rebels were positive about talks, the home minister marred the environment by threatening to take action against them. Yadav, who strongly criticized Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Bam Dev Gautam, said that law and order cannot be maintained if a criminal leader is appointed the home minister. He also said that Bam Dev Gautam is out to make the Maoist unsuccessful, alleging that the Madheshi People's Rights Forum and the CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal- United Marxist-Leninist] are hatching conspiracies against the Maoists. Their intention to join the government is to bring about Maoists' failure, he added.
Yadav claimed that he had established contact with the armed groups of the Terai plains and held talks with nine different outfits of the southern plains. The Maoist leader also criticized Finance Minister Baburam Bhattarai. ""Bhattarai talked of changing the party name when he visited the US. His intention was to please the foreigners. Such a proposal is just unacceptable."" The 'Maoist' tag cannot be sacrificed because it is about party's ideology, ideals, culture and identity, he said, adding that if the Maoist ideology is abandoned, the party will come to an end. Admitting that there were differences within the party, Yadav said the revolutionary faction was dominating. If the revolutionary group is not in the majority, the nation will be in disaster, he said, adding that the goal of People's Republic will eventually be attained.
Yadav also said that all Maoist fighters should be merged into the Nepal army in bulk. If the combatants are integrated partially, there will be a rebellion, he warned. He added that those who had spoken against army integration are opposing the whole peace process.
Nepali Congress [NC] spokesman Arjun Narsingh KC said his party would participate in the special panel for army integration if the panel is formed by the Constituent Assembly [CA] on the principle of equal representation. But he added that the party will not participate in the present committee because its formation was unconstitutional.
Leader of the CPN-UML Rajendra Pandey said the government will not be able to bring the armed groups to talks. ""The issue of talks is only a propaganda. The government is not working seriously on the matter.""

Among them are Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dina Nath Sharma who have been nominated as the Maoists' representatives for peace talks with the government.
They are due to meet with the government soon to attempt to end the insurgency which has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
""Nepal police have filed a case against over 600 Maoists including their party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda) and coordinator Babu Ram Bhattarai for their involvement in terrorism in the country,"" the radio said.
In a writ petition to the appellate court, police have asked for sentences ranging from ten years to life imprisonment for the rebels, a highly-placed police source told AFP.
""The case was filed against the rebels for their involvement in destructive activities in Bhiman in the (eastern) Sindhuli district last year in which they killed 49 police personnel including a police inspector,"" the police source said.
The court has ordered the arrests of those named.
The police filed the cases despite the government and guerrillas declaring a mutual ceasefire on January 29.
However, a Maoist source said they believed the cases had been filed for technical legal reasons to enable the king to grant the rebels amnesty in the future.
The source said there were more than 5,000 Maoist activists in police, judicial or army custody.
The rebels have been demanding the release of their jailed supporters before sitting down to talks.
This week seven Maoist supporters were set free.

Text of report published by Nepalese eKantipur website on 27 December
Kathmandu, 27 December: Agitating journalists carried out protests across the country covering their mouth with black cloths on Saturday [27 December] protesting against the serial attacks on media bodies and the journalists. 
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ), the umbrella organisation of Nepali journalists, announced additional protest programmes after other various organisations expressed solidarity in their struggle for press freedom. 
Journalists in the capital gathered at Bhrikutimandap at around 2.30 this afternoon. They were joined by other professionals and political leaders. 
Addressing the gathering, FNJ President Dharmendra Jha said the struggle for press freedom will continue until the environment to publish news freely is created. 
He said the government itself attacked the media persons, accusing it of not being serious towards the security of journalists. 
Narayan Wagle of Editors' Alliance charged that the press was attacked as per the Maoist policy of not letting people having differing opinions stay anywhere. 
He called on the government to create an environment for the journalists to work freely. 
On the same occasion, Nepali Congress youth leader and lawmaker Gagan Thapa said that the Maoist attacks on media, before entering the constitution-writing process, raise doubts over the commitment of the Maoists towards democracy. 
Likewise, UML [Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist Leninist] leader Raghuji Pant accused Prime Minister and Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal of working towards freeing the guilty of journalist Birendra Sah's murder. 
Yesterday, journalists throughout the country wore black band around their arms to support the agitation called by the FNJ. 
The journalists have taken to the streets since Himalmedia Pvt Ltd was attacked by Maoist-aligned unionists last Sunday. Similarly, the UML affiliated youths had allegedly torched several issues of Ankush Daily which is published from Birgunj, on the next day. A journalist of the Avenues Television was beaten up by Maoist affiliated students on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, Maoist unionists have been taking control of the regional office of the Kantipur Publications in Biratnagar for three days preventing the printing of Kantipur daily and The Kathmandu Post.

""There can be no concrete talks with Pakistan until it changes it stand that Kashmir should be part of Pakistan because it's a Muslim-majority area,"" the Aaj Tak television network quoted Vajpayee as saying in an interview.
Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, but both claim it in its entirety. The Indian-held portion of Kashmir is the only predominantly Muslim region in India, where more than 80 percent of the 1.02 billion population are Hindu.
Vajpayee's interview came two days before he is to depart for Pakistan to attend a summit of seven South Asian nations. He is to attend meetings along with Pakistani leaders, but no separate one-on-one talks on Indo-Pakistani issues have been announced.
Pakistan is eager to hold direct talks with India on resolving the Kashmir issue and other disputes.
India says Pakistan must end its support of what it calls cross-border terrorism before direct talks can be held.
India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Islamic rebel groups fighting for Kashmir's independence from India or its merger with Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. More than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict since 1989.
Set up in 1985, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives and Bangladesh.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 7 February
Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 7 February: The US mission in Nepal has been authorized to continue providing economic and development assistance to the government of Nepal and to the peace process here, even if the Maoists belong to the government.
According to a press release issued by the American Centre here on Wednesday, the authorization comes in the form of a licence granted to the US Department of State and US Agency for International Development (USAID). The licence was issued 5 February 5 from the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and is valid until 28 February 2008.
US Ambassador James F. Moriarty welcomed the issuance of the licence and noted: ""This licence enables the US mission to meet its commitments to continue supporting the people of Nepal and the peace process."" 
The embassy and its development arm, USAID/Nepal, requested the State Department and USAID in Washington to seek the licence because of US prohibitions against providing aid to terrorist organizations. The US government designates Maoists, who continue to use violence, extortion, and intimidation, as a terrorist organization.
The US mission to Nepal provides most of its development assistance in Nepal through non-governmental organizations. Some does go through the government of Nepal, however. 
The ambassador stressed that if the Maoists enter the cabinet without abandoning violence, the US mission will work to ensure that Maoists ministers cannot claim credit for US assistance.
In coming days, the US mission will be consulting with Washington on licence requirements and also briefing USAID/Nepal contractors and grantees in Nepal on this positive development.

"5953",20073603,"Title: Deadly Snake Bites Surge With Monsoons.rtf; Date: August 10, 2007 Friday 6:21 PM GMT; Text: The monsoon rains that flood wide stretches of South Asia each year force creatures large and small onto whatever dry land can be found, and the result is scores, if not hundreds, of fatal snake bites.
""Everything, everyone, is restricted to tiny, tiny islands with very little space,"" said Romulus Whitaker, a snake expert. ""Everyone is crammed in together and the chances of running into snakes, stepping on them, grabbing them and sleeping on them is much, much more.""
That's how Paltu Ram, a farmer in his 20s, died.
Stranded with a few hundred villagers on a sliver of land encircled by flood waters in the Bara Banki district of northern India, about 370 miles east of New Delhi, he decided to climb a tree to see if he could spot a rescue boat.
On his way up, he reached for what looked like a brown rope. It wasn't and when he grabbed it, the snake recoiled and struck, sinking its fangs into his arm.
""Paltu jumped into water saying he was bitten by snake. Before he could be taken to a doctor he died,"" said his father, Rameshwar, who couldn't say what kind of snake got his son.
So tight is the association of snakes with the monsoon season that serpents have been both feared and revered for centuries in much of the subcontinent much like the rains themselves.
The monsoon season is vital for farmers, who provide a livelihood for two-thirds of India's 1.1 billion people. But this year's monsoon has been calamitous: At least 2,090 people have been killed across South Asia and 19 million forced from their homes.
Snakes are not the only dangerous creatures that compete with people for dry land. In India's northeastern Assam state, flooding forced rhinos from their habitat at the Kaziranga National Park last week. Their panicked charges killed one person and injured two others.
Hundreds of people in India have been bitten by snakes this season, though officials don't keep exact figures, and experts say even annual totals are considered unreliable. But in neighboring Bangladesh, the government said at least 35 of the 226 people killed in the monsoon have died of snake bites. It has been the country's second-highest cause of death after drowning.
There are hundreds of different snakes on the subcontinent, many of which are venomous. But only four are responsible for the vast majority of deaths kraits, russell's vipers, saw-scaled vipers and cobras.
All are extremely dangerous and all are venerated.
The appearance of those snakes, especially cobras, has long been viewed as a harbinger of coming floods and the renewed fertility that follows. Their disappearance is considered an omen of a coming drought.
In some parts of India, it is also believed snakes can cause plagues by blowing their breath across the land, and malaria is known as snake-wind disease.
Hindu gods are often depicted with cobras: Shiva is seen wearing a girdle of serpents and cobras for earrings; Vishnu is pictured resting on the coils of a multi-headed cobra.
In India and Nepal, where authorities say a handful of the 92 people killed by this year's monsoon died from snake bites, there is even a special holiday to worship the serpents.
Snakes feature in some Buddhist legends, such as the tale of the giant cobra that used its hood to shield Buddha from the sun as he meditated in the desert.
There are no hard figures for the density of the snake population on the subcontinent, but anecdotal evidence suggest it's high. Whitaker said the tribal hunters he works with can pull two or three cobras from a 5-acre rice paddy in a day.
""That's a lot of snakes from a small patch,"" he said.
The reason there are so many is the small farms that still cover much of rural India provide the perfect habitat for snakes' prey, such as rats or frogs.
""Plenty of water in irrigated rice fields; there are places in the country where rats are worshipped so they don't kill them,"" Whitaker said.
The good news is that it usually takes hours or sometimes days for a snake bite to kill, and that only 10-20 percent of such attacks are fatal, depending on whom you ask.
But some people must walk for days to get to hospitals. Others turn to traditional healers before getting anti-venom.
Rahmat Mia, 45, a farmer, in northern Bangladesh was bitten a few nights ago while returning from a market.
His family first took him to a healer, and stayed for hours trying out various herbal remedies. By the time Babul Hossain, the local doctor, persuaded them to go to the hospital, it was too late Mia died on the way.
Associated Press reporters Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow, India, and Julhas Alam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, contributed to this story.

Text of press release by Paris-based organization Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) on 31 December entitled ""Press Freedom Round-up 2006: 81 journalists killed - the deadliest year since 1994""; subheadings as published
In 2006
- 81 journalists and 32 media assistants were killed
- at least 871 were arrested
- 1,472 physically attacked or threatened
- 56 kidnapped
- and 912 media outlets censored
In 2005:
- 63 journalists and 5 media assistants were killed
- at least 807 were arrested
- 1,308 physically attacked or threatened
- and 1,006 media outlets censored
The deadliest year since 1994
At least 81 journalists were killed in 2006 in 21 countries while doing their job or for expressing their opinion, the highest annual toll since 1994, when 103 died (half of them in the Rwanda genocide, about 20 in the Algerian civil war and a dozen in former Yugoslavia). 32 media assistants (fixers, drivers, translators, technicians, security staff) were also killed 2006 (only five in 2005).
Iraq was the world's most dangerous country for the media for the fourth year running, with 64 journalists and media assistants killed. Since fighting began in 2003, 139 journalists have been killed there, more than twice the number in the 20-year Vietnam War (63 killed between 1955 and 1975). About 90 per cent of the victims were Iraqis. Investigations were very rare and none were completed. Unlike other organizations, Reporters Without Borders includes journalists in its death count only when it is certain that their deaths are linked to their work as journalists. Dozens of other cases have not been included because investigators have not yet determined the motives or because it is clear that they were not related to the issue of press freedom.
The second most dangerous country was Mexico, which also moved ahead of Colombia as Latin America's deadliest place for the media. Nine journalists were killed there in 2006 because they were investigating drug trafficking or reporting on violent social unrest. US cameraman Brad Will was shot dead in late October in turbulent Oaxaca state, where strikes often degenerated into armed clashes, and other journalists were injured there.
The body of journalist Enrique Pera Quintanilla, editor of the monthly Dos Caras, una verdad, was found by a roadside in the northern state of Chihuahua in August. The paper specialized in reporting on unsolved murders and drug trafficking.
The situation in The Philippines was grim too, with six journalists killed (compared with seven in 2005). Fernando Batul, a commentator with the radio station dyPR, was shot dead in late May as he was going to work on Palawan Island, southwest of Manila. The authorities said he was killed because he had criticized a brutal policeman, who was subsequently arrested and will shortly be tried. The March 2005 killers of anti-corruption columnist Marlene Esperat were jailed for life. But those punished were only triggermen and those who ordered the killings are still walking free. However, in a country where impunity is the rule, the trial and sentences were a good precedent.
Three journalists were killed in Russia, making 21 since President Vladimir Putin came to power in March 2000. The murder in October of reporter Anna Politkovskaya, of the weekly Novaya Gazeta and a Chechnya expert, was a reminder that even the best-known journalists with major international support do not escape such deadly violence. Pressed by democratic countries to find and punish the culprits, the government has assigned a team of 150 detectives to the case.
Press freedom shrank further in neighbouring Turkmenistan, with the crackdown on independent media reaching a peak in September when the family of Radio Free Europe correspondent Ogulsapar Muradova announced she had died in prison, three months after being jailed. Despite repeated demands by the European Union, the authorities did not investigate her death. In Lebanon, a photographer and a TV technician were killed by Israeli bombing during the war with Israel. A dozen journalists were injured or wounded during the fighting in the summer.
Violent election clashes
Over 1,400 physical attacks or threats were recorded by Reporters Without Borders in 2006, which was another record. Many of them were during election campaigns in various countries.
Attacks on journalists in Bangladesh, already routine, became daily at the end of the year, a few weeks before key parliamentary elections, and were carried out by security forces and political party supporters.
A dozen countries in the Americas held important national elections during the year. Reporters Without Borders had registered more than a dozen physical attacks on journalists and another dozen threats to them in Peru by early March, a month before presidential elections,. In Brazil, a daily paper's offices were ransacked on election day by supporters of a local politician in the southern town of Marilia.

"4904",20066771,"Title: Nepal 's king fights for his throne.rtf; Date: April 23, 2006 Sunday 3:54 AM GMT; Text: The King of Nepal's refusal to release his firm grip on power has helped unite a fractious opposition and threatened his survival as exalted head of the country, analysts said.
King Gyanendra faces weeks of continued pressure after he gave some ground Friday by offering to return power to the people -- but was dramatically rejected by some 300,000 Nepalis who took to the streets.
Political scientist Professor S.M. Habibullah, of Kathmandu's Tribhuwan University, said Nepal was just ""at the beginning"" of a protest movement to try to shift power from the monarch to the politicians.
King Gyanendra Friday asked the seven-party opposition alliance to choose a prime minister but politicians refused as he still retained the power to sack political leaders and take outright control of the country.
""The hub of politics is not outside the palace,"" said Habibullah. ""The political parties have already said: we're not ready to take the gift (accept the offer) of the king.""
The opposition have stepped up their demands for the reinstatement of parliament, suspended by King Gyanendra in 2002, and the creation of a constituent assembly to decide the future of the monarchy.
""If he goes for the constituent assembly that's going to be the end of the monarch"" in his current guise, said one diplomatic source.
But if the protests continue ""it will take him a while to get to the stage where he realises he has absolutely no choice,"" the source said.
King Gyanendra may seek to drive a wedge between the Maoists and the seven-party alliance that is promoting a general strike that has virtually paralysed the impoverished Himalayan kingdom since November 6, analysts said.
The Maoists, who have fought a bloody 10-year insurgency that has left more than 12,500 dead, struck a loose deal with the opposition in November last year.
The politicians agreed to the key Maoist demand for a referendum on the constitution while the rebels agreed to cooperate with the parties.
The seven-party alliance has stuck even though the parties range from the hard left to others who want the king to retain a ceremonial role under any new system.
It has also survived a clampdown during April by King Gyanendra that has seen more than a dozen killed, hundreds wounded and even more arrested.
""The kind of repression that has taken place has united the political parties,"" said South Asian analyst Sukh Deo Muni.
Analysts said the king could try to exploit the often tempestuous relationships between the alliance to weaken their campaign.
Even while running the country before King Gyanendra seized total control in February last year, Nepal was marked by inter-party feuding and political deadlock.
""The king may try to disintegrate the seven-party alliance,"" said Mahendra Lama, professor of South Asian Studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
""The king will try to play the parties against the Maoists. It will be a very, very untenable position.
""If the king becomes obstinate, people may look for the demise of this institution,"" he said, even though the monarch is traditionally revered as the incarnation of the God Vishnu, the protector.
""The writing is clearly on the wall. If the king remains obstinate this could very well be the case.""
There were early signs of the tactic of division in the editorial of Sunday's state-run newspaper, The Rising Nepal, which warned of a ""historic blunder"" if the opposition parties failed to form a new government. 
""Should the political parties fail to listen to the grievances of the people and let anarchy and chaos prevail in the country again, it will compound the problems,"" it said.
The opposition has declared economic war on King Gyanendra urging citizens to stop paying taxes, utility bills and asked Nepalis living overseas to stop sending money home.
The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) said King Gyanendra had no legitimacy as monarch ""as he is a coup leader"" who overthrew the government.
""His ouster can only be seen as a just resolution of the coup,"" said the Hong Kong-based group. ""Moments for decisive change appear very rarely. Such a moment is now upon Nepal.""

"6701",2008963,"Title: 14 killed in Nepal bus plunge.rtf; Date: July 19, 2008 Saturday 3:10 AM GMT; Text: At least 14 people were killed when a passenger bus skidded off a mountain highway into a river in southern central Nepal, police said Saturday.
""We have recovered 12 bodies from the Trishuli river and two died while undergoing treatment at a hospital,"" police officer Rabindra Bahadur Singh told AFP from Chitwan district, 70 kilometres (44 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
The bus carrying more than 50 passengers was en route for the southern town of Bhairahawa from Kathmandu when it plunged into the swelling Trishuli river at Chandi Bhanjyang village overnight.
Twenty-six people were rescued but police said the death toll could rise.
""Half of the bus is still submerged inside the river. There might be some more bodies stuck inside the bus,"" the police officer said.
Road accidents are common in Nepal and claim hundreds of lives every year. Most of the accidents in the impoverished Himalayan country are blamed on old vehicles, reckless driving and poorly maintained roads.

"995",20033295,"Title: Traffickers thrive selling young Nepalese girls to brothels in neighboring India.rtf; Date: October 7, 2003, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: When police lead in an unshaven man with a grim, pockmarked face, dozens of women look hard to see if he's the one who tried to sell them as slaves to the brothels of India.
Staring at the man, who insists he is just a roadside dumpling vendor, the women cross their arms or finger long black braids, standing quietly in colorful tunic dresses that were gifts from their intended brothels.
""Look closely. He may have changed his appearance,"" says Anuradha Koirala, the head of Maiti Nepal, an activist group that rescues and rehabilitates young women sold to Indian brothels. ""Any of you recognize him?""
All the women shake their heads no. They are honest and wish no ill will against a stranger.
That's what makes them so appealing to the traffickers who lure girls and women from Nepal's villages with promises of better lives in India or the Persian Gulf. The women are wide-eyed with honesty and deferential to Indian men, who consider them among the most beautiful in South Asia, with their fair skin and almond eyes.
""Our girls are very submissive, very innocent. Girls here don't know they can say no, so it's very easy to take them,"" said Koirala, a former school teacher and government minister who founded Maiti Nepal in 1993.
Sex trafficking is a problem around the globe. The United Nations estimates 700,000 to 4 million women and children are sold worldwide into forced prostitution and other slave labor each year, earning traffickers $7 billion annually.
Of the 150 women and girls - some as young as 14 - asked to look at the trafficking suspect in Katmandu recently, 34 had just been rescued at two dozen border crossings. With no visas required for the neighboring countries, slipping girls across the border is as easy as hopping on a bus.
""I don't even know why I went. He told us it would be fun,"" says 14-year-old Kanchimaiya, one of the just rescued girls.
She had sneaked out of her village with a girlfriend after a stranger invited them on a road trip. Never having been away from the village, with no phones or MTV, the girls jumped at the chance to see some more of the world.
Former sex slaves who now work with Maiti and the police at the border crossings recognized the look in their eyes and pulled them off the bus.
""I just wanted to have some fun,"" Kanchimaiya says with a shrug, her eyes downcast.
Trafficking between Nepal and India had appeared to be on the wane in the last decade, but the numbers have been shooting up again, Koirala said.
""All of the sudden, this year, it's really going up,"" she said, adding that the 34 girls rounded up in one weekend sweep was the largest rescue in a year.
Times are hard in this lush Himalayan kingdom, where 40 percent of 23 million people live in poverty. Political friction since the murder of King Birendra two years ago has heightened unease, and a few weeks ago Maoist rebels pulled out of peace talks and resumed a seven-year insurgency that has nearly ruined Nepal's only industry, tourism.
Already bad, women's situation has only worsened, Koirala said. ""People send the boys to school. The girls get married and serve others, so their families disregard them.""
Or sell them.
Lama is a student with a dainty faux-diamond stud in her nose. She blushes like any 18-year-old when asked about a boyfriend or marriage.
But marriage and children are unlikely. Lama, who asked that only her surname be used, is infected with HIV, although she remains in good health thanks to a European friend who sends expensive AIDS drugs unavailable in Nepal.
Lama now lives and studies at the Maiti shelter school, having renounced her family, who she says didn't stop a man called ""grandfather"" from taking her from their small village at age 7. Lama doesn't know if her parents sold her; she stopped wondering years ago.
""It's because of them that this happened to me,"" she says. ""I have long forgotten them.""
As a little girl, she thought the long bus ride to Bombay, the bustling financial hub in western India along the Arabian Sea, was a great adventure. The women at the fancy house where ""grandfather"" left her seemed nice.
""There was a big hall with lots of beds separated by curtains,"" she says. ""I didn't know what was going on, until a man sat down next to me on the bed.""
She fought off men for a month, despite daily beatings. Her keepers gave up and sold her to another brothel.
""It had much nicer rooms and they didn't make me have sex for 15 days,"" Lama says. ""The woman (manager) was very nice and treated me like a daughter.""
Wanting to please her surrogate mom, Lama stopped fighting the men. She had just turned 8.
""I didn't know I was doing a bad thing,"" she says. ""I didn't like it - but I wanted to please her.""
Then the fevers began. The brothel sent her to a ""home for sick girls,"" where she remained for four years, alone and in pain.
When she was 11, a doctor explained what it meant to be HIV-positive. The following year, Indian police rescued Lama and called on Maiti to t"

""Supaul, Araria, Madhepura, Samastipur, Khagaria, Bhagalpur and Saharsa districts are totally submerged in water and the tremendous loss cannot be assessed at this moment,"" Paswan told ANI over phone from Purnia.
The Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilisers and Steel is on an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas of Bihar. The floods have affected 15 districts of the State.
He said the Nitish Kumar government has failed to handle the situation and lakhs of people are suffering but the government is doing nothing to help them.
Paswan blamed the Nitish Kumar Government for the present situation in the flood affected areas, and said that the State Government has failed to take any precautionary measures.
""The State Government should have taken precautionary measures like repairing the damaged embankments, store food grains, keep boats etc in the affected areas in advance because flood is a regular feature Bihar,"" the Minister said.
With the Kosi river continuing to unleash its fury in Bihar districts bordering Nepal, over 20 lakh people are bearing the brunt of floods. The Army was called out to help the marooned people on Tuesday.
The Army will work in addition to three IAF helicopters dropping relief materials for the sixth day on Tuesday.
So far, 42 people have died in the flood in Bihar, official sources said.
Three IAF choppers airdropped relief materials in the flood-ravaged villages of Supaul, Araria and Madhepura districts where more than 12 lakh people were hit by the flood caused by the breach in the east Kosi afflux embankment in Nepal on August 18.
According to a Central Water Commission, the Kosi, Ganga, Ghaghra, Punpun and Burhi Gandak were flowing above the danger level at several places along their course.
The Bihar government has constituted a technical committee, headed by retired engineer-in-chief of the water resource department Nilendu Sanyal to supervise the restoration work and closure of the breach in the East Kosi afflux embankment.

Kathmandu: Stating that General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Madhav Kumar Nepal was arrested in the style of an abduction and subsequently detained, political parties and human rights activists have protested against it.

"4970",20066641,"Title: Nepal Maoist leader takes part in BBC Nepali Service phone-in.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: September 9, 2006 Saturday
The Nepalese Maoist leader has said his party is doing everything to push the peace process forward to meet the aspirations of the people's movement. He said certain political circles were back-tracking on agreements reached. He promised redress for incidents of Maoist violence and punishment of those involved. He said the Maoist party would accept the will of the people over the question of establishing a republic, even if they chose to maintain the monarchy. Following is the text a special BBC Nepali Service phone-in programme titled: ""Prachandalai Prasna"" or ""Question for Prachanda"", with Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, broadcast live via Nepalese Radio Sagarmatha FM 102.4 on 8 September
[Presenter] Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Prachanda, and Suman Kharel are on stand-by at Sagarmatha FM studio in Kathmandu awaiting your questions.
[Moderator Kharel] Thank you Jitendraji. I welcome you all to this special BBC Nepali Service one-hour presentation: ""Question for Prachanda"". I also want to inform you that about a dozen FM stations are relaying this programme.  Kantipur Television will also be replaying the programme after some time. 
At a time when the nation is at the crossroads between war and peace and at a time when most Nepalese are anxious about what will happen tomorrow, we, journalists have been putting questions to our leaders almost every day. But what do people - from those living in the remote mountainous districts to those living in America and Europe - want to ask Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is known as Prachanda. We called for those questions through telephone, e-mail and letter. We have received questions from our listeners not in the hundreds but in the thousands, not just from Mechi to Mahakali but from 41 countries throughout the world. Prachanda is a personality who led one of the most successful Maoist wars in the world in current times. But what should also be not forgotten is that thirteen thousand people have died in the course of the war, numerous have been orphaned, thousands displaced and the country's infrastructure has borne huge losses. 
Prachandaji, How do you feel being present here today to answer the questions that have come in their thousands from the Nepalese?
[Prachanda] Thank you. First of all, I, on behalf of our party and myself personally, want to thank you Sumanji and the whole team of the BBC Nepali Service for organizing with so much labour this kind of a programme, which could be the first in Nepal.
[Kharel] The first questioner is waiting on the phone. Mr Chairman, please answer. 
[Prachanda] All right. 
[Listener from Baglung in western Nepal , name indistinct] Prachandaji. Namaskar.
[Prachanda] Namaskar. Ask what you want.
[Unidentified questioner] The talks are going on. The talks look like they will succeed; not so, Prachandaji? Maoists have joined the mainstream.
[Prachanda] The talks are going on. All the Nepalese want the talks to be successful. Our party is trying to make it successful, as this is the last time we are doing so. We have tried three times already [in the past].
[Listener] Let me ask my question. Once the People's War ends, after the talks, you have accused many people of being spies although everyone lived together in the same society in the past. Some have been killed, some maimed. Now, that society will see a lot of personal retribution. What will you be doing about such a society when the time comes?
[Prachanda] In the course of building a new society, if the problems piling up for hundreds of years can be solved in the course of this dialogue process, all those old wounds on both sides will be cured in the course of time. Once the new Nepal is born, once the process begins, all the past pains will be forgotten, just like labour pains, as, we believe, the new baby will be beautiful. That process must be started.
[Suman Kharel] Now, a question e-mailed by Roshan Sapkota from Britain. Almost 75 per cent of your military is made up of those under 20 years old. You talk of merging the two armies, while many of those in your army may want to become doctors, engineers, artists and writers. How will you fulfil their dreams?
[Prachanda] First of all, the figures he uses are not factually correct. I do not know where he got his statistics about 75 per cent being under 20. 
[Moderator Kharel] What is the figure?
[Prachanda] We have not calculated it in terms of percentage. Regarding the People's Liberation Army, we do not recruit those below 18. The statistics are not quite right, as we have been doing it according to the rule. I want to request the questioner to correct his figures.
[Moderator Kharel] The questioner also asks about what you will do to fulfil the dreams of those who want to pursue other professions like doctors and engineers and artists. Why make them carry "

"3474",20052972,"Title: Millions locked in forced labour while exploiters reap the profits_ ILO.rtf; Date: May 11, 2005 Wednesday 1:00 PM GMT; Text: More than 12.3 million people are locked in forced labour, generating a massive 32 billion dollars in profits for those who exploit them, the International Labour Organisation said in a first ever global snapshot of the problem Wednesday.
In a study advocating a global alliance to wipe out an expanding ""social evil"", the ILO estimated that forced labour occurred mainly in Asia but fostered largely unchallenged worldwide.
""Forced labour represents the underside of globalisation and denies people their basic rights and dignity,"" ILO Director General Juan Somavia said.
""To achieve a fair globalisation and decent work for all, it is imperative to eradicate forced labour,"" he added.
Some 9.5 million of the victims of forced labour are in Asia, 1.3 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 660,000 in sub-Saharan Africa and 260,000 in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the study's estimates.
Another 360,000 are in industrialised countries and 210,000 in transition countries in central and eastern Europe.
The majority -- 56 percent -- are women and girls, while just under half are children. 
Asia's biggest forced labour problem still involves bonded workers mainly in Nepal, India and Pakistan, where impoverished people fall into a debt trap and are forced to work to pay back loans from employers, the ILO found.
It emphasised that forced labour is present on all continents ""in almost all countries and in every kind of economy"".
""We're giving significant figures in regions where forced labour has not previously been identified,"" study chief Roger Plant told journalists.
Forced labour was defined by an international convention in the 1930s to include all involuntary work extracted from a person under the threat of a penalty. 
That extended from the better known use of imprisoned camp labour by totalitarian regimes to bosses withholding wages or identity documents to stop workers leaving, officials said.
Most of the victims -- 9.8 million people -- are vulnerable, poor people exploited by private agents as bonded labour, or forced into domestic or agricultural work, the report underlined.
""There are practically no investigations or prosecutions of this in the world,"" Plant underlined.
While most forced labour in the private sector is thought to be underground activity commanded by a few individuals, the ILO said there were signs that it was reaching into the mainstream corporate sector through sub-contractors.
""We have identified sectors where there is cause for concern that forced labour can be penetrating the supply chain of private companies, including quite major companies,"" Plant said.
Another 2.5 million people are forced to work by states or by rebel military groups, notably in Myanmar where the practice is widespread according to the labour agency.
The report estimated that the world was only aware of ""the tip of a disturbing iceberg"" as forced labour modernised and expanded into new areas such as domestic workers, rice mills, mining and carpet weaving.
Industrialised and transition countries are mainly affected by human trafficking, the ILO said.
An estimated 270,000 people in the West are exploited by smuggling rings taking advantage of the combination of immigration restrictions and the growing number of people leaving their country in search of work.
Apart from commercial sexual exploitation, people were pressed into domestic work, the construction industry or farming.
The report called on governments, trade unions, and employers to join forces with a combination of vigorous policing and preventive action on poverty and employment, especially at national level.

The All Nepal National Free Trade Federation (ANNFTF) said in statement late Wednesday that notices had been sent to 24 prominent firms warning them to shut their businesses or ""face the consequences"".
""We had placed an 11-point demand including the release of our federation activists and stopping the exploitation of the workers of the 24 industries but the government ignored our request,"" ANNFTF chairman Salikram Jamkatel said in the statement.
The Maoists demands include learning the whereabouts of activists arrested by security forces and compensation for union members killed in fighting.
Among the enterprises targeted are deluxe hotel Soaltee-Crowne Plaza, the Surya Tobacco Company (STC), the Aqua Mineral Water factory, Bottlers' Nepal (a Coca-Cola company), Elite Petrol Station, a string of garment and fabric factories and steel rolling mills.
""Most of these establishments including Soaltee-Crowne Plaza hotel and Surya Tobacco Company are owned by the Royal family members and jointly run by foreigners,"" an official of the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) said.
STC is financed by the Indian Tobacco Company and the British-American Tobacco Company.
Maoist rebels have also been demanding that the beverage companies and brewers pay them taxes to fund their insurgency, a prominent beer industrialist said on condition of anonymity.
A source close to the Maoists said the rebels planned to raise about six billion rupees (80 million dollars) to train some 6,000 new recruits -- mostly youths -- and to buy equipment.
The new recruits were forcefully abducted from various villages in the Achham and Dang districts of western Nepal and most of them are school students, the source said.
The rebels have been waging an increasingly deadly battle to topple the constitutional monarchy and install a communist republic. The uprising, launched in 1996, has so far claimed nearly 10,000 lives.
Japanese tourists, meanwhile, have begun cancelling bookings after Tokyo last month warned its citizens not to visit Nepal in view of a series of bomb attacks in and around Kathmandu, hotel owners said.
Nepal's Minister for Communications and Information, Mohammad Mohsin, said foreign ministry officials were holding talks with the Japanese Embassy in a bid to have the notice withdrawn.
""It is our prime duty to protect foreign visitors to Nepal,"" Mohsin said.

"1804",20044347,"Title: Protests banned in Kathmandu after opposition threatens to storm palace.rtf; Date: April 8, 2004 Thursday; Text: Nepal's government Thursday banned demonstrations in Kathmandu and imposed a curfew after opponents of King Gyanendra's rule threatened to storm his palace to culminate a week of mass protests.
The government said it took action after intelligence that demonstrations would be infiltrated by Maoist rebels, who shut down the Himalayan kingdom for three days through Thursday with a general strike.
""In order to avoid bloodshed for the common people, the government has declared Kathmandu a riot-affected area and therefore banned the holding of demonstrations and public meetings of more than five people,"" a home ministry statement said.
""Stringent action will be taken if anyone tries to break this order,"" the home ministry said, adding that weddings and other ""cultural events"" would be exempt from the ban.
The government also imposed a five-hour night curfew in Kathmandu ending Friday morning.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, chief organiser of the protests that have brought tens of thousands to the streets, had earlier threatened that demonstrators would Friday ""cross the barricades to the palace as we enter the final stage in our struggle.""
Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a leader of the five-party alliance demanding King Gyanendra restore democracy, said demonstrators would defy the ban Friday.
""We will go ahead with our protests and we don't care about the consequences. The government order shows its mental vaccuum,"" said Adhikari, a former finance minister.
The king dismissed the elected government for ""incompetence"" in 2002 and appointed his own cabinet. He has been unmoved by the protests, noting there was widespread discontent with corruption and lack of development during the parties' rule.
Amid the furore in Kathmandu, the king has continued a tour of villages in western Nepal, meeting victims of the Maoists who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy.
It was an attempt to storm the palace exactly 14 years ago Thursday that led then King Birendra, King Gyanendra's late brother, to end three decades of absolute royal rule.
King Birendra's palace guards had opened fire on demonstrators who tried to rush the palace in the culmination of six weeks of protests.
The then royalist prime minister, Krishna Bahadur Bhattarai, said at the time that up to 500 demonstrators were killed, although later accounts have questioned whether the death toll was so high.
This year's protests are led by veterans of the 1990 struggle who are furious that King Gyanendra effectively ended their achievement at securing democracy.
The king had on March 28 agreed to hold elections by April 2005, but the parties demanded the vote be held under a ""neutral"" government.
Leading human rights activist Kapil Shrestha said the protests were picking up at a similar pace as 14 years ago.
""Once again we are obliged to take to the streets against the king's steps to thwart the people's sovereign rights,"" Shrestha said.
He noted the protests in Kathmandu were drawing a wide spectrum of society. Among the participants in Thursday's demonstrations were 1,000 handicapped people, who chanted slogans from their wheelchairs as part of a group of Nepalese with disabilities that has joined the protests.
The Maoists have offered moral support to the demonstrations in Kathmandu, saying the two sides needed to come together to defeat the ""feudal forces.""
But the rebels and the democratic parties are far from forging an alliance. Mutual distrust lingers from the time of democratic rule when elected governments deployed the police against the rebels and the guerrillas killed dozens of party activists in the countryside.

"6566",2008971,"Title: 50,000 villagers in flooded India refuse to leave(2).rtf; Date: September 7, 2008 Sunday 4:14 PM GMT; Text: At least 50,000 people in India have refused to abandon their homes in flood-ravaged northern Indian despite pleas by authorities to evacuate, an official said Sunday.
Newspaper advertisements also urged thousands of flood survivors Sunday to go to one of 77 state-run camps set up in Saharsa district in impoverished Bihar state, where clean drinking water, food and medical care was available.
At least 50,000 people have refused to leave the district, one of the worst-affected areas in Bihar, said Prataya Amrit, a state disaster management official. Towns and villages in the flooded region are home to about 1.2 million people.
Rescue workers have evacuated about 900,000 villagers, but with river levels falling by up to two feet over the last few days, thousands began to return to their homes, Amrit said.
The Kosi River, which flows down from the Himalayas in neighboring Nepal into India where it joins the Ganges River, burst its banks Aug. 18 and dramatically shifted course, moving dozens of miles to the east.
It turned hundreds of square miles of land in Bihar into a giant lake.
On Saturday, government engineers began digging a new channel to correct the course of the river and plug the mile-long breach in the embankment.
Disaster officials have not said when it would be safe for villagers to return, and displaced residents may have to remain in camps for several months. Most areas will likely remain flooded until monsoon rains taper off in November, officials say.
The government has set up more than 250 relief camps throughout the inundated region and rushed about 900 doctors and medical supplies there.
Already hundreds of cases of pneumonia, diarrhea and high fevers have been reported. Doctors started immunization drives Saturday in the shelters to counter fears that waterborne diseases will spread as the number of camp residents grow.
Authorities have only confirmed 38 deaths, but it is widely believed the final toll will be much higher.
In neighboring Bangladesh, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in its latest bulletin Sunday said most major rivers were flowing above the danger mark and floodwaters were only likely to start receding by the end of next week.
The government gave no details about the number of people killed in Bangladesh, but news reports have said at least 19 people have died over the last two weeks.
The monsoon season, which runs from June to September, brings rain vital for the farmers of South Asia but also can cause massive destruction.

"95",20031248,"Title: British begin rapid buildup in advance of possible war in Iraq(3).rtf; Date: February 28, 2003, Friday, BC cycle; Text: A month ago, the British area of Camp Fox was nothing but a pristine patch of golden sand in the Kuwaiti desert. By Friday, it had become a bustling base, filled with tents, flatbed trucks and supplies for British fighters.
Unlike American troops, many of whom have been here for months, British forces only began arriving in Kuwait a few weeks ago and have had to hustle to get themselves ready for a possible war in Iraq.
Most of the 18,000 to 20,000 British troops here arrived in the past two weeks. At least 6,000 more are expected in the coming days.
""If you compare us as a force to the last Gulf War, then we've moved twice as much in half the time,"" said Lt. Col. Debbie Noble, a British military spokeswoman. ""There's more of a sense of urgency with this one because we have come in late in the day.""
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have threatened to invade Iraq because they feel Saddam has not fully cooperated with U.N. inspectors trying to verify disarmament. The two allies, joined by Spain, have sponsored a U.N. resolution that would open the door to military action.
A quarter of the British army and its biggest naval task force in 20 years is building up in the region. The Royal Air Force also has ordered 100 planes and 27 helicopters.
Because the British arrived so rapidly, they were forced to rely on U.S. troops already here for help.
British soldiers at Camp Fox ate U.S. military rations when they first arrived. And U.S. Marines helped them with security, gave them hot showers and extra supplies.
""They've got the infrastructure in place and we've been able to blister on to it,"" Noble said. ""We came in so late in the day that we had no choice.""
British and U.S. Marines are running drills together in the desert to familiarize themselves with each others' weapons and vehicles. British Marines also planned to practice running into and out of U.S. helicopters, just in case they need a lift during a battle.
""This will give us the opportunity to work with each other,"" said Capt. Jay Delarosa, a U.S. Marine spokesman.
The British base at Camp Fox is responsible for supplying nearly all the arriving British troops.
Using electronic scanners, members of the 6th Supply Regiment Royal Logistics Corp., whose motto is ""Supply or Die,"" log in tons of supplies arriving in huge shipping containers, everything from replacement tank engines to medical supplies.
""You can't just move a whole force and drop them on the ground and expect them to be ready to fight,"" said Lt. Dave Barlow, 24, of Birmingham, England.
In one part of the camp, engineers used flatbed trucks and machinery to lift shipping containers and have begun filling up a storage area that could eventually hold 10,000 tons of ammunition.
In another area, Nepalese Gurkha engineers cut the lumber that will be used to make an outhouse.
The vast desert field beyond the camp will soon be covered with hundreds of shipping containers acting as storage closets for British supplies that can be rapidly moved to soldiers at the front.
""It does seem like we're playing catch up,"" said Maj. Chris Davis, the camp commandant. ""We're now reaching the stage where we've probably come up to readiness.""

"6942",20083078,"Title: Tibetans protest near Chinese Embassy in Nepal 's capital, 3 injured including monks.rtf; Date: April 22, 2008 Tuesday 12:27 PM GMT; Text: Nepalese police clashed with Tibetan protesters Tuesday, bloodying at least three demonstrators including two Buddhist monks who were condemning a recent Chinese crackdown in their Himalayan homeland.
Scuffles broke out after baton-wielding riot police stopped about 50 Tibetan exiles from marching toward the Chinese Embassy and began detaining them.
An Associated Press reporter saw two monks and another demonstrator who were injured, with blood visible from their mouths and noses.
Police arrested all 50 protesters and drove them away in trucks to detention centers.
A few hours later, nine Tibetans entered the U.N. building in Katmandu after slipping through police surveillance and handed a statement to officials demanding an international investigation into the crackdown in Tibet.
They were not allowed to stay inside the U.N. premises and left through a back door, said Yeshi Gyaltzen, who was in the group. He said U.N. officials assured them the message would be forwarded to U.N. headquarters.
Tibetan exiles, including monks and nuns, have been holding almost daily protests in front of the Chinese Embassy and United Nations office since March 10.
Police have broken up almost all the anti-China protests and detained hundreds of demonstrators, who were usually released hours later.
Nepalese officials have said they will not allow protests against any friendly nations, including China.
The Chinese government accuses the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and his supporters of organizing protests that turned violent in Tibet on March 14 and later spread over a wide swath of western China.
China said 22 people died in rioting in the Tibet capital, Lhasa, on March 14 when hundreds of shops were torched and Chinese civilians attacked.
The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile denies any involvement in the violence. It says more than 140 people were killed in the government crackdown.

"5934",20071442,"Title: Nepal Maoist chief speaks of _rebellion_ if poll conditions not met.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: August 1, 2007 Wednesday
Excerpt from report by Ujir Magar headlined ""Nepal Maoist chief Prachanda sets conditions for election"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 1 August
Kathmandu, 31 July: The chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Prachanda, has said that holding constituent assembly elections will be impossible without declaring the nation a republic and adopting a proportional electoral system.
If these conditions are not met, mass rebellion is the only alternative, the Maoist chief has said.
In the political report he is going to present at his party's central committee meeting on Tuesday [31 July], Prachanda has said that there is no alternative to mass rebellion. He has said it has become possible only after the 10-year-long people's war, 19-day-long people's movement and the one-year-long peaceful movement after joining the peace process.
[Passage omitted]
District leaders have already come to the capital for the extended meeting. The members of the party central committee have emphasized that mass rebellion must be launched before the constituent assembly elections, unless Nepal is declared a republic by consensus, the source said.
[Passage omitted]
Top leaders have raised the question as to what model of rebellion should be adopted while the Maoists are in the government. They have said that the leadership should be ready to make sacrifices for the sake of the rebellion. It has been suggested that the party should immediately pull out of the government, and announce a programme of struggle, said the source.
Maoist leaders have complained that all manner of blame was being heaped on the party in order to isolate it. They have suggested that innovative strategies be adopted.
""Things did not improve even after we joined the government. The public is frustrated. No worker is safe. The leadership should be serious about how to move ahead in such a situation"", said one of the top leaders.
In an informal meeting that is being held prior to the central committee meeting, leaders are divided on the question as to whether the rebellion should be launched before or after the constituent assembly polls.
""Though the party leadership was unanimous on the idea of rebellion, there were differences on the question of timing,"" said another member, adding that the party believes the rebellion will be peaceful, as it has already given up the path of armed struggle. We abandoned the 10-year old war with the evaluation that republic may be achieved in a peaceful way; we signed the peace agreement; now, India and our fellow political parties have betrayed us, he said.
The Maoist party has analysed that its influence will decrease with the prolonging of the transitional phase. Maoist leaders think that they were treated badly Nepali Congress party. Management of fighters will be difficult due to monsoon rains if the rebellion is launched immediately. The masses are also less likely to join the streets during this time. Therefore, the struggle must continue from inside the government and parliament before the rains months pass.

Conservationists from across the region said at a Kathmandu conference that diclofenac, an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug commonly used in South Asia to treat buffaloes and goats, posed a major environmental threat.
""If the current use of diclofenac continues, vultures will become extinct from South Asia after two years,"" Lindsay Oaks, a veterinary microbiologist at Washington State University in the United States, told the conference.
Oaks led a study published last week in the British weekly Science that said the vultures suffered kidney failure and died after building up high levels of diclofenac from the carcasses of livestock.
Researchers have found a 95 percent population decline in three species of vultures over the past decade in India and Pakistan.
In Nepal, only three vulture nests were found in 2003 in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve east of Kathmandu compared with more than 60 just four years ago, said Hem Sagar Baral, president of Bird Conservation Nepal.
The US embassy in Kathmandu, which is supporting the conference, said the extinction of vultures ""may have far-reaching economic, ecological, and public health implications.""
""Vultures are thought to play a role in the control of important human and veterinary diseases such as anthrax, tuberculosis and brucellosis,"" an embassy statement said.
The fall in the birds' population first came to light in Bombay where the Parsi community's traditional funerals entail leaving bodies outside for vultures.
Researchers initially believed the decline in vultures was due to rapid population growth, but the loss of habitat could not explain the dramatic drop in numbers.

"4668",20064723,"Title: Nepalese Maoists present three-point proposal at Delhi talks.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: March 12, 2006 Sunday
Text of report by Jhalak Gaire, published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 12 March
Rolpa [mid-west Nepal]: The Maoists have put forward a three-point proposal during talks with the seven opposition political parties in New Delhi, India. The Maoists said the talks were ongoing because the two sides have not yet reached final agreement on the proposals presented by the Maoists. A top-level Maoist leader, assessing the second-round New Delhi talks, said that the rebel party had presented three options for the progressive resolution of the problem. The talks have gone on because the two sides have failed to reach an agreement on the three points. 
According to the Maoist leader, the rebels are trying to establish a common slogan, a joint front and the common goal of restoring democracy with the seven political parties. The seven parties, however, have said that a constituent assembly election is the ultimate political solution to the problem. ""We have shown maximum flexibility for the peaceful resolution of the country's conflict. But the [parliamentary] political parties have failed to act with courage,"" said Maoist central leader Dev Gurung.
Gurung was speaking at a meeting at a school in Rolpa which was attended by more than 150 school teachers from Rapti zone [mid-west Nepal]. The nation will have to bear further losses unless the parties show the courage required to move one step further. ""The parties have failed to move ahead to the level expected,"" Gurung told the Rolpa meeting. Complaining about the parties' failure to agree to build a common front with the rebels, Gurung said that the parties might have been scared by the remarks of the US ambassador, James F. Moriarty. 
As the first option, the Maoists have proposed that a broader political conference of all democratic forces should be held which would form an interim government. The government would conduct the constituent assembly elections. Everyone would have to accept the constitution written by the constituent assembly, which would pave the way for the formation of other components of government.
During the New Delhi talks, the parties have stressed the restoration of parliament. ""A parliament that may be restored and dissolved on the king's whim is not a real parliament,"" said Maoist leader Gurung. In a constitutional monarchy, the king's role should be limited to that of a rubber stamp. If parliament is restored as it is, the king's power would be consolidated. Such a restoration would not be acceptable to the Maoist party, Gurung said. If parliament is necessary at all, the parties should work to restore a genuine parliament and announce a parallel government, Gurung said.
As the second option, the Maoists have proposed that parliament should be restored at a popular level which would be recognized by the United Nations or any international organization. The third point is that a roundtable meeting of political and civic forces should announce an interim government that would hold the constituent assembly election. In the New Delhi talks, the political parties are pressing the Maoists to withdraw their blockades and closures. They are also demanding the dissolution of the people's army and the rebels' people's government.

Five students also were injured in the crossfire at Mutuhara village, about 375 miles northeast of the capital, Katmandu.
The fighting in the remote village took place into the night Monday.
An army official at Nepalgunj, the regional headquarters of the security forces, said soldiers stormed the high school after receiving information that the communist rebels had taken control of the school.
The injured students were flown to the hospital on army helicopters and were receiving treatment, said the official, who declined to be named.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since last week when a nine-day cease-fire imposed by the rebels during the Hindu Dasain festival expired.
Nearly 400 people have died since the rebels pulled out of peace talks and a seven-month cease-fire in August.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. The government has labeled them terrorists.
More than 7,400 people have been killed since the insurgency began.

 Kathmandu, 22 June: The Rashtriya Prajatantra Party RPP has rejected the proposal of the CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) that the seats secured in the 1999 general elections be made the basis for joining the government. During a meeting held at the RPP's office in Kamalpokhari Kathmandu Tuesday 22 June , the CPN-UML argued that the power-sharing should be done on the basis of seats secured in the dissolved parliament.
 But the RPP took the stand that the 1999 elections cannot control power-sharing and that the three parties Nepali Congress (Democratic), RPP and CPN-UML must share the ministerial berths proportionately. These issues were raised during the meeting of the task forces of both parties formed to chart a ""common minimum programme"" for joining the government.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 23 Jun 04, p1
CPN-UML leader Bam Dev Gautam argued that the best determining factor in power-sharing will be the results of the last general elections. But Assistant General Secretary of the RPP Khem Raj Pandit rejected the proposal outright. ""What was their leaders' status earlier? This cut-off point is not practical,"" a leader told ""Rajdhani"", quoting Pandit. ""Even if we take the last elections as the standard point, the prime minister's party is yet to contest elections. How can the votes of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) headed by the prime minister be determined?""
 The RPP task force claimed that it had helped remove the Surya Bahadur Thapa government, and had thus paved the way for a multi-party government. So it demanded that justifiable standards be set for power-sharing. The RPP added that the party has incurred heavy losses for its efforts.
 Although the standards for joining the government could not he finalised, the CPN-UML had dropped the demand for reinstatement of local bodies. The RPP argued that the spirit of multi-party government should trickle down to the grassroots level as well. In response, the CPN-UML said that it would not make an issue out of the reinstatement of local bodies. Even as it agreed to drop the demand, it reiterated that the revival of local bodies was the best option.  passage omitted

The food drops on Saturday to 2,200 villages cut off by flooding aimed to help desperate residents in the worst-hit eastern parts of India's Uttar Pradesh state. Umesh Sinha, the state relief commissioner, also said nearly 280,000 acres (113,000 hectares) of rice paddy crops had been destroyed.
In India's northeastern Assam state, flooding forced rhinos from their habitat at the Kaziranga National Park and their panicked charges killed one person and injured two others, wildlife officials said.
At least 229 people have been killed in India and neighboring Bangladesh, and 19 million driven from their homes in recent days. The South Asian monsoon season runs from June to September as the rains work their way across the subcontinent, a deluge that scatters floods and landslides across the region and kills hundreds of people every year.
The number of dead in Bangladesh rose to 81 Saturday, up from 65 a day earlier, the country's information ministry said. Raging floodwaters have battered 38 out of 64 districts in the delta nation of 145 million people.
Fakhruddin Ahmed, head of Bangladesh's military-backed interim government, visited the northwestern district of Sirajganj on Saturday. Despite the devastation, he said the government had enough food and medicine to distribute and foreign assistance wasn't yet needed.
One person looking for that help was 45-year-old Aleya Begum, who took shelter on an embankment with more than 50 other families after their homes washed away in Pabna, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital, Dhaka.
She said the group was short of drinking water.
""I've lost everything. We need help from the government to survive,"" Begum said.
Low-lying areas around Dhaka were under neck-deep water, and many residents were using boats to travel around. Government meteorologists said water levels in Dhaka continued to rise.
Flooded rivers started to recede Saturday in the Indian state of Assam but there was no such respite in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states.
Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh's top elected official, said India and neighboring Nepal had signed a treaty in 1996 to solve the annual flooding by building dams and hydropower projects, but the projects have not yet begun.
In Uttar Pradesh, flooding deaths came in all shapes and sizes: Two villagers were killed when a house collapsed, two children were swept away by floodwaters, and one person was killed by a snake bite.
So far this year, some 14 million people in India and 5 million in Bangladesh have been displaced by flooding, according to government figures.
Associated Press reporters Julhas Alam and Farid Hossain in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Wasbir Hussain in Gauhati contributed to this report.

Wishing success to Tapi Mra, the lone mountaineer from Arunachal Pradesh, Mr Tuki hoped that many more youths of this Himalayan state would tread in his footsteps, inspired by his success. ''His efforts would bring laurels for the state,'' Mr Tuki added. 
He also appealed to the people to protect the rich flora and fauna and natural beauty of the state. Earlier, in a press briefing Mr Mra said, ''I do not represent any club or association, except my state. All the success I achieve in the mountaineering arena will be known as an Arunachalee's feat at the national level and an Indian citizen in the world.'' Even at the young age of 26 years, Mr Mra has the credit of climbing experience of more than 10 peaks. He belongs to the Lemeking area in Upper Subansiri district of the state and completed his mountaineering course from Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling. He completed Para Gliding courses from Manali and Basic Water Sports course from Regional Water Sports Centre in Pongdam in Himachal Pradesh. He has claimed to have climbed the 6,160 metre high Island Peak in Nepal last year bare foot, adding that if weather permitted, he would try once again to scale the Mera peak without shoes. Replying to a question on why he chose the Mera peak, he said, ''My main aim is to climb Mt Everest in a solo effort in the latter part of this year. Before that it is essential to scale the 'B' category of summits under which the Mera peak falls.'' He said he derived inspiration from Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to scale the highest peak Mt Everest, and always aspired to be a mountaineer. He also said he believed that he would be the first Indian to attempt solo climbing of Mt Everest, adding that earlier, a New Zealander had succeeded to scale the highest peak in a solo effort. The state government has already sanctioned Rs 10.75 lakh from the non-plan sector during 2008-09 for the Mt Everest expedition by Tapi Mra. Mera peak is the highest peak among the 33 'B' category peaks recognised by the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). The Nepal Himalayas are divided into two groups - the peaks 7,000 to 8,848 metres high, called expedition peaks under control by Department of Tourism and Civil Aviation Mountaineering section of Nepal government, and those of 5,500 to 6,654 metres height, named trekking peaks and controlled by the NMA. After completeing his present expedition, he would collect data for suitable weather conditions in Nepal for scaling Mt Everest, he said.

"2327",20043966,"Title: Novelty in Congo_ U.N. Investigates a Massacre.rtf; Date: December 24, 2004 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Crime scenes in eastern Congo are not normally cordoned off with yellow police tape. Investigations are almost unheard of. The blood just washes away, children scoop up the shell casings or misplaced machetes, and the witnesses, if there are any, just try to forget.
 But here on an overgrown hilltop that used to be a militia camp, a bamboo fence encloses a dozen sites where mass killings are thought to have taken place. Gathered around the area recently, peering into pits containing human bones, were prosecutors from Congo and from the International Criminal Court intent on bringing justice.
 The mere fact that the killings are being investigated is a rare and welcome development in this lawless region, where massacres have become the order of the day.
 There are countless towns like Ndrele, places where so many unspeakable acts have taken place for so long that most people had lost hope of living a normal life. But United Nations peacekeepers, alarmed by the allegations of atrocities, broke with their normally passive approach in early December and ordered a raid on Ndrele.
 Their forces easily routed the militias and proved, at least for now, that there is no inevitability to the lawlessness here, that it is possible to take back the eastern Congo from the militias, provided there are enough troops to enforce the peace. 
 On a recent afternoon Uyera, a plump grandmother, sat on the side of the main dirt road selling mandro, a fermented drink made of corn. She told how local militias used to stop and gulp down as much as they wanted. When she asked for payment, they scoffed and walked away. 
 Theft was commonplace when the militiamen from the Armed Forces of the Congolese People ran Ndrele. A woman selling fruit says she had to give some to whichever armed man came by. At the end of the day, other guerrillas would insist on a portion of her profits. They called it taxation.
 The men would beat or kill anyone who dared to resist. Rape was a constant danger. One activist, Sofi Aromborac, has a list of 282 girls and women who have been raped over the past two years. ''Even if you were an old woman like me, you could be raped,'' she said.
 Concerned about the rising abuses, United Nations peacekeepers, most from Nepal, surrounded the militia base on the hill overlooking the town in early December and ordered the fighters to surrender. When they refused, the two sides exchanged fire, with the guerrillas eventually breaking through the soldiers' line and retreating.
 It was the largest military engagement involving Congo peacekeepers since they were deployed here in 2000, United Nations officials said. It was followed by a raid on another militia camp 12 miles away, in Mahagi. In that case, the militias retreated even more swiftly.
 The results have been startling. Ndrele has settled into something resembling normalcy. On a recent market day, thousands of people from surrounding villages swarmed into town under the watchful eye of the peacekeepers. One man whose son had been killed by the militia years ago said it was the first time in five years he had dared come to Ndrele. 
 The women in the market said that they were selling more than ever and that, best of all, they no longer had to share their wares and their profits with the militias.
 Besides reassuring residents, the raid instilled fear in the militiamen. More than 100 have come to a disarmament camp that the United Nations set up in September to reintegrate combatants into society. Those who do not come now face the wrath of local residents, who have begun rounding up anyone they regard as a guerrilla. At least 10 have been killed. 
 Mangara Ukethwengu, 20, had been with the militia in Ndrele but decided to give up. As he walked along the road to go to the transit camp, however, residents set upon him with machetes, leaving gashes on his arms, head and groin. 
 ''I can understand why they're angry,'' said Mr. Ukethwengu, who was recovering in a makeshift prison cell at the military base in Mahagi. ''The militia has been hurting them and they wanted to hurt me.''
 Local religious leaders have called on the population to stop the brutality. After all, it is not certain how long the 100 or so Nepalese solders who now patrol Ndrele plan to stay.

 Jajarkot, 7 October: The lengthy and continuous blockade imposed by rebel Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) on the remote mountainous district of Jajrkot west Nepal has resulted in shortages of everyday basic necessities. Daily life in the district is becoming increasingly painful and hard.
 The shortages of basic needs arose after Maoists blockaded the district headquarters, Khalanga, since the first week of Bhadau two months ago . Goods and even people have been prohibited from entering Khalanga since then.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Oct 04
Rice, lentils, sugar, kerosene, oil, vegetables, chickens, goats and other such items are not available in Khalanga these days. Businessmen say that existing stocks have been depleted and, since they cannot be replenished, consumers are bearing the brunt. Business transactions have stopped, they say.
 Without any modern mode of transport, goods are transported on the backs of mules from Salli Bazaar and Shitalpati of Salyan. It takes two days to travel the route on foot and, since the Maoists have set up a ""base area"" en route, businessmen cannot bring in supplies. Farmers have not been able to sell their produce because of the blockade. This has created a situation where agricultural produce is going to waste and at the same time none of it is available in the district headquarters.
 The ban on transporting goats and chickens to the district headquarters from the villages has resulted in meat shortages. Maoists staying at various entry points of Khalanga have been sending people coming into the district headquarters back to their village, according to a villager who made it to Khalanga, on condition of anonymity. He said that, since a large number of Maoists were gathered in his village and meetings of the Maoist high command were taking place, they have been strictly implementing the blockade.
 Reports have said that Maoist military training has concluded in various places of Jajarkot recently.
 A statement signed by the chief of Maoist village people's government of Khalanga says that since his party is in the final phase of a centralized military offensive against the ""old regime"", it has banned the supply of milk, vegetables and other farm products to the leaders of the regime.
 Although there is no clear response as to why the blockade has been imposed, Maoists have demanded the release of six of their activists, including a village people's government chief, who were taken into custody by the security forces from Jagatipur of the district last month. No agency has so far taken any initiative towards lifting the embargo.
 ""Dashain major Hindu festival is nearing. Nothing is available on the market. Nobody appears to be concerned even during such a time,"" worries Prakash Karki of Khalanga-3.
 The blockade has affected even the postal services. Contact by individuals and organizations with the outside world have been lost with the absence of the only communications medium in the district. But the acting chief district officer Jhalakram Adhikari, claims that there will be no shortages during Dashain and says, ""We will provide supplies even if it means transporting the goods by helicopter.""
 Businessmen, civil servants, human rights activists, media persons and others have issued a joint statement calling on the Maoists to lift the blockade without delay.
 They have appealed to the Maoists to lift the prohibition of movement of goods and people with the Dashain in mind.

The Maoist leadership in a statement said 12 rebels engaged in an all-night clash that erupted late Tuesday at Pandun in the southwestern Kailali district.
It said the dead included a guerrilla known as Prahar who commanded one of the 16 battalions of the Maoists' self-styled ""People's Liberation Army.""
He was the second ""battalion commander"" to die in the nearly eight-year insurgency. The first died in a 2001 battle.
But the Maoists dismissed a report by state-run radio that 50 rebels were killed at Pandun. An army official said Thursday that troops had recovered 46 bodies of guerrillas.
It was impossible to independently verify the toll in the remote area.
In separate violence, police said 12 more Maoists were killed late Wednesday in a clash in the Rupse jungle in the western Palpa district and that three rebels died in northeastern Solukhumbu.

"4027",20053049,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists reinstate senior leaders suspended for policy differences.rtf; Date: July 18, 2005 Monday 1:06 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebels Monday said they had patched up a split in their ranks by reinstating three senior politburo members who were suspended after they disagreed on policy with the top leader, Prachanda.
On May Day, Prachanda had admitted a split in the top rebel leadership and accused his deputy Baburam Bhattarai of betraying the fight to overthrow the king and establish a communist republic in the Himalayan nation.
Bhattarai led the rebels in failed peace talks with the government in 2003.
But on Monday, in an e-mailed statement, Prachanda said Bhattarai and two others had been reinstated in an effort to reunite the party which has been waging an insurgency against the monarchy that has claimed around 12,000 lives since 1996.
""Comrade Baburam Bhattarai has been reinstated as the politburo standing committee member with Rahul (the wife of Bhattarai also known as Hishila Yemi) and Ashok (also known as Dinanath Sharma) as the politburo members,"" Prachanda said in the e-mailed statement.
The move comes slightly more than a week after the rebels offered to hold talks with the country's political parties on a strategy to reverse a takeover by King Gyanendra in February.
Gyanendra said he seized power from a four-party coalition government on February 1 because they had failed to tackle the Maoist rebellion.
Bhattarai is known to back an alliance with the political parties who have also been at loggerheads with Gyanendra.
An alliance of seven political parties welcomed the Maoist offer of talks, but called on the rebels to lay down arms before any negotiations.
As well, the Maoists offered to hold talks under the United Nations during a visit by UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi earlier this month to Kathmandu.
The UN envoy welcomed the Maoist offer for talks on resolving the country's crisis, but said the rebels must also end their violent campaign and lay down their weapons.

Capt. Charie Vigilant, the force's press attach said on Tuesday in Entebbe, some 40 km south of Ugandan capital city of Kampala that the 1,500 troops would be out of Bunia by Sept. 1 and will fly out of Entebbe Airbase by Sept. 15.
The 1,500 force has been in Bunia, the commercial capital of Ituri region since June.
The European force set a logistics base at the Entebbe Airbase in June.  The airbase is now busy as the soldiers prepare to ship out and their hardware could be seen at the airbase, according to the report.
About 2,000 United Nations peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay and Bangladesh, are already in Bunia. Pakistani and Nepalese troops are expected to bring the total to 4,700 in September.
However, the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to authorize the French-led force to stay in eastern Congo longer and assist UN peacekeepers scheduled to take over on Sept. 1.
Under the resolution approved by the 15-member council, the French-led multinational force would be ready to provide emergency help to the UN peacekeepers if necessary. The disengagement of the French-led force should last until Sept. 15 at the latest, the resolution said.
The war in RDC began in August 1988, when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into the country to back rebels seeking to topple then- President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia then sent forces to prop up the Kinshasa government.
Violence between the ethnic majority Lendu and minority Hema people has claimed an estimated 50,000 lives since 1999 and displaced a million others.

The arrested have been identified as Pasang Moktan (33) of Parsa and Dhan Bahadur Limbu (31) of Morang. DSP Hridaya Thapa informed that Limbu was an active member of UCPN-Maoist-aligned Young Communist League and Rescue Nepal.
Limbu in association with Moktan, a central member of so-called National Liberation Movement Nepal, had abducted Phuyal from Thamel on Wednesday at around 4 pm before taking him to a house in Swoyambhu.
""They abducted Phuyal in what they claim to retrieve Rs 1.5 million that Phuyal had collected from five persons promising to find job placements in Afghanistan,"" informed DSP Thapa. ""Taking a person hostage is illegal"".
According to police, Phuyal was working with Keshav Thapaliya, who is living in Dubai. Phuyal had coaxed five persons into depositing three lakh rupees each to his bank account in exchange for jobs in Afghanistan.
Of the five, four persons recently returned home from Dubai, where they were stranded for 70 days following a failed attempt to sneak into Afghanistan. However, one person is said to have reached Afghanistan.
The victims had then sought help from Limbu and Moktan to get their money back. Police are going to press fraud charges against Phuyal and arrest Thapaliya once he returns home.
SSP Rana Bahadur Chand appealed to all to be cautious before dealing with brokers who coax people into paying hefty amount of cash for false promises like jobs in foreign countries.

"3370",20044026,"Title: Congo Peacekeeper Sex Scandal_ Investigators Said to Be Threatened.rtf; Date: December 17, 2004 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
United Nations investigators looking into charges of rape, pedophilia and prostitution involving peacekeepers in Congo have been threatened with retaliatory attacks, and witnesses have been bribed to change incriminating testimony, a draft report says.
 The confidential 34-page document details 68 allegations of sexual misconduct by peacekeepers from Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa, Tunisia, and Uruguay, and lists incidents where soldiers from Morocco, Pakistan and Nepal worked to obstruct investigators.
  The majority of allegations involved peacekeepers soliciting prostitutes, but there are nine cases of rape cited, including one in which a Nepalese soldier is charged with kidnapping and repeatedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl over a three-day period.
 A team led by Angela Kane, an assistant secretary general, has been sent to Congo to step up the investigation, and the organization's Office of Internal Oversight Services is expected to make public soon how many of the 68 allegations are supported by enough evidence to merit legal action. 
 Earlier investigations of the scandals, according to United Nations officials, have resulted in the imprisonment of a French civilian near Paris on charges of pedophilia and the suspension of a senior official from Australia for consorting with Congolese prostitutes in a bar. 
 The report, dated July 15 and first disclosed by The Washington Post on Thursday, said that it was difficult to identify and apprehend perpetrators because of the inability or unwillingness of women to name them, the lack of cooperation from commanders and because troop contingents rotated so frequently that individuals were difficult to trace. For many of the women, the report noted, prostitution is their livelihood and foreign troops their favored customers.
 It said that Congolese women working for the United Nations were afraid to report supervisors' demands for sex for fear of losing their jobs. Another problem was the number of babies fathered by soldiers, who usually had returned to their own countries before the children were born.
 Although the United Nations has openly addressed sexual abuse by its personnel in Congo, the scandal has further harmed the organization's reputation at a time when it is under fire for mismanagement and corruption in the oil-for-food program and members of the United States Congress are calling on Secretary General Kofi Annan to resign.

"5033",20065800,"Title: Nepal royal government frees former prime minister who was jailed on corruption charges(2).rtf; Date: February 14, 2006 Tuesday 4:27 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's royal government freed a former prime minister who had been jailed on graft charges by an anti-corruption commission annulled this week by the Supreme Court, an aide said Tuesday.
Sher Bahadur Deuba was released around midnight from a jail in the nation's capital, Katmandu.
King Gyanendra had sacked Deuba before seizing direct control over the government, arresting leading politicians and declaring emergency rule on Feb. 1, 2005. The king later created the Royal Commission for Corruption Control, saying it would bring corrupt politicians and government bureaucrats to justice.
Despite the king's power grab, the nation's judiciary has largely retained its independence, and its decision to annul the commission was a blow to Gyanendra, who had been accused by critics of using the panel to crack down on political adversaries.
The Supreme Court annulled the commission on Monday, saying it was set up ""against the norms and spirit of the Constitution.""
The court also declared all decisions made by the commission invalid, leaving the government no choice but to free Deuba.
""My main goal will be to restore democracy and I will dedicate myself to this purpose,"" Deuba told reporters at his residence on Tuesday.
In the past year, many of the country's leading politicians have mounted a campaign to recind direct rule and restore democracy in the Himalayan country.
""By this ruling, the court has established the concept of independence of the judiciary, existence of rule of law and recognized the sovereignty of the people,"" Deuba said.
No reasons were given why Deuba was freed at midnight, after a group of supporters who had been waiting outside the jail for his release had already returned home.
Early on Tuesday many of his supporters were already at his house in the northern suburb of Katmandu to congratulate their leader.
""The court has finally given us justice. This has made it difficult for the king and a defeat for the royal government. The release will boost our movement to restore democracy and end the king's direct rule,"" said Dip Kumar Upadhaya, a close aide and senior leader of the party.
The court decision and Deuba's release gave encouragement to an alliance of seven main political parties that has been organizing demonstrations to pressure the king to restore democracy.
""The court has finally given us justice. This is a victory for democracy and a humiliating defeat for the royal regime,"" Upadhaya said.
The king had given the anti-graft panel broad powers to investigate and jail politicians and bureaucrats.
Deuba was the highest official to be put behind bars by the commission, which found him guilty of corruption in two separate cases. Former Cabinet Minister Prakash Man Singh was also jailed by the commission.
Both Deuba and Singh refused to answer questions from the commission, saying the body was illegally established.
The king justified his takeover last year by saying it was needed to combat an anti-monarchy communist insurgency that has claimed about 13,000 lives since 1996, and to bring political stability to the country. He also promised to control corruption.

The conference is being organised in view of the World Health Organisation's prediction that by 2010, 60 per cent of the world's cardiac patients will be from India alone and by 2015, 100 per cent rise in mortality from CAD is projected in India. President Pratibha Patil would be the Chief Guest at the three day conference being organised at the B.K. Om Shanti Retreat Centre, Gurgaon. 
The Conference WCCPGC 2008 will bring together experts from the field of cardiology across the globe, for a comprehensive overview of this rapidly increasing heart problem. Rapid urbanisation, globalisation, industrialisation and health transition are the main factors for premature metabolic syndrome and premature heart attacks. If drastic steps in lifestyle optimisation and timely medicalisation are not undertaken, the mortality and morbidity with the premature heart attacks will rise to a very high level of red alert. The conference will highlight the needs and importance of 'Lifestyle Optimisation, Aggressive Secondary Prevention of Cardio Vascular Disease and Primary Prevention of a High Risk Group by Polypill'. Dr. H.K. Chopra, an eminent cardiologist of International status from Moolchand Medcity, Chairman of World Heart Academy, and Secretary General of International Medical Sciences Academy (IMSA) World Headquarters will be the organising chairman of this event. According to Dr. Chopra, ""The rising prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in Indian urban adults was 1 per cent in 1960, 11 per cent in 2003, and has now increased to 14 per cent. It is 4 times higher in Indians in all the age groups. To be an Indian itself is a risk factor for premature CAD. Risk for CAD is 20 times higher than Japanese. CAD is more extensive, diffusive, multivessel and more premature among Indians as compared to their Western and European counterparts."" Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam would address the conference on September 20 while several eminent doctors including Dr Navin C. Nanda, US, International President, Dr Sahgal, US, International Director, Dr Sandeep Gupta, UK, International Director, Dr M.R. Pandey (Nepal), International Director would also participate in it. Dr Chopra said, ""Most of us are walking emotional time bombs of metabolic syndrome with seeds of premature heart attack."" Timely effective medicalisation with a heart protective pill (containing Aspirin, Ramipril, Statin, Metoprolol) after 50 and lifestyle optimisation from the childhood is the need of the hour to reduce the rising menace of premature heart attacks in our country.//

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 6 November
Kathmandu, 5 November: Leaders of the political parties have said that the US concern regarding the reports of possibility of an alliance between the main political parties and the Maoists was just a part of diplomatic decorum and there was no need to cast doubt.
The leaders have reaffirmed their stance that there would be no collaboration with the Maoists until the latter shunned weapons and joined the political mainstream, and requested the US and other friendly countries to remain assured.
The US embassy on Friday [4 November] issued a statement and termed the possible alliance between the agitating political parties and the Maoists as alarming and warned the parties to remain aware.
Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] Bam Dev Gautam said that the comment by the US government was just a part of diplomatic decorum. ""We will accept the suggestions of foreigners for democracy, people and the nation,"" he told journalists at a function in Bhaktapur on Saturday [5 November], adding, ""But it is not that we have to do whatever they say."" He said that Nepalese people in no circumstances would accept autocratic monarchy. ""Though he issued such statement as part of diplomatic decorum, the US ambassador knows the situation very well.""
Gautam also said that collaboration with the king as suggested by the US has become impossible because of the king. ""The parties' efforts in the past 12 years to collaborate with the king became unsuccessful because of the king's ambitions,"" he said, adding, ""We cannot work with the king at a time when people's rights have been snatched.""
He said that the parties would not ask the Maoists to surrender. ""We don't want to weaken the Maoists and bolster an autocratic regime,"" Gautam said.
Spokesperson of the Nepali Congress [NC], Krishna Sitaula, said that all friendly countries' cooperation would be necessary to hold talks with the Maoists and urged everyone not to doubt the US concern. He reiterated that the Maoist problem could be solved only through talks. [passage omitted]
NC central member Narahari Acharya said that the parties already have a clear stance that they would collaborate with the Maoists only if the rebels held talks with the parties and prepared infrastructure for collaboration. He said that the US comment in such situation was arbitrary.
""The US reaction expressed in the name of collaboration between the parties and the Maoists sounded like arbitrary,"" Acharya said. [passage omitted]
Likewise, leaders of agitating parties speaking at the Reporters' Club on Saturday [5 November] have said that there is no reason to panic over the US remarks. ""They have just reiterated their previous stance,"" NC central member Arjun Narsingh KC said. ""The supporters of autocracy are wrong to see advantage in that [US reaction]. There is no reason for us to panic,"" he said.  [passage omitted]
Central member of CPN-UML Subash Nemwang said that his party has not taken the US reaction as supportive of the royal move. ""We didn't find anything like that,"" he said. He said that the parties have sought dialogue with the Maoists to find political solution to the Maoist problem and urged all not to interpret that as collaboration. ""When there have been widespread protests against autocracy, the matter should not be understood as collaboration,"" Nemwang said, adding, ""We are in the process of dialogue not collaboration with the Maoists.""

"256",20032854,"Title: UN takes over from French -led force in Congo troublespot.rtf; Date: August 31, 2003 Sunday; Text: The French-led peacekeeping force in the troubled Ituri province of the Democratic Republic of Congo handed over control of its last post to the United Nations Sunday as fresh fighting was reported.
The handover occurred a day before the UN was due to officially take charge of peacekeeping operations on Monday to impose order on a region where 50,000 people have been killed in ethnic violence since 1999.
The UN force, called the Ituri Brigade, will operate under a wider mandate than the French-led European force, who were restricted to Bunia and to firing in self-defence.
The UN soldiers are permitted to engage hostile forces before being fired on and to operate throughout Ituri.
The new UN units went on the alert Saturday when renewed violence erupted.
A UN spokesman said fighting had broken out between The Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) -- the dominant armed group in the region from the minority Hema community -- and militia from the majority Lendu ethnic group, around Fataki, north of the provincial capital Bunia in Ituri, northeastern DRC.
""Two helicopters with the Ituri Brigade went on a reconnaissance mission over the Fataki and Bule areas Saturday,"" spokesman Leo Salmeron told journalists.
The Fataki region is under the control of the UPC, which is also dominant in Bunia, although its power has been considerably reduced since the deployment of the French-led peacekeeping force in June.
The new fighting appeared to have occurred Friday and Saturday.
""We can confirm that Fataki was completely deserted and destroyed and the central market and private dwellings suffered considerable destruction,"" the spokesman said. The situation appeared normal at Bule.
Asked if the Ituri Brigade would intervene, he said it would ""intervene in the very near future in Fataki"".
A humanitarian mission would go to the area in the coming week.
Meanwhile Colonel Gerard Dubois, spokesman for the French-led European Union force, told reporters: ""We have just transferred the last post held by the multinational force to the Ituri Brigade.""
A platoon of 58 Bangladeshi UN soldiers took over the post on a road between Bunia and the airport, relieving a French contingent.
The official handover was set for Monday after a two-week transition that started on August 16.
The EU force, mostly French and called ""Artemis"", was deployed to protect civilians after inter-ethnic clashes in Bunia.
UN peacekeepers in the region at the time were not only outnumbered but also not mandated to open fire to try to quell the violence.
The new UN force will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower at its disposal, including the use of attack helicopters.
Some 2,400 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Indonesia are already in Bunia, according to a military spokesman.
A Nepalese contingent will bring the total to around 4,000 from October.
The local population is anxious that the deployment of the stronger UN force will prevent a situation like that in May, when Bunia suffered intense fighting between rival militia, despite the deployment of 700 Uruguayan troops.
Ethnic violence between the majority Lendus and the minority Hema tribe in the region has claimed the lives of 50,000 people since 1999 and displaced half a million.

Five Maoist rebels and one government soldier died in fighting after Maoist guerrillas attacked security bases and government buildings overnight in the north-central town of Chautara, sparking gunbattles that lasted into Monday morning, an army official said on customary condition of anonymity.
Four civilians were injured in the fighting in the remote, mountainous town, but their conditions were not known.
The attackers knocked down the town's telecommunications tower, severing communications, and raided an army base, police post, the district administration office and the local jail, a local official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized speak to the media.
The Maoists have seized control of much of Nepal's countryside in a 10-year communist insurgency that has killed about 13,000 people.
In Katmandu and the suburb of Lalitpur, meanwhile, the government imposed a 11 a.m.-6 p.m. curfew.
Katmandu has been the scene of nearly three weeks of demonstrations in which police have clashed with protesters demanding King Gyanendra relinquish the power he seized 14 months ago.
Opposition parties said they planned only small gatherings for Monday ahead of a massive anti-king protest set for the next day on the ring road that circles Katmandu. An opposition alliance statement issued Sunday said hundreds of thousands of supporters are expected to attend.
The ring road has drawn gatherings of more than 100,000 protesters since the alliance backed by the Himalayan kingdom's communist rebels launched a general strike on April 6, even though the road falls within the curfew zone.
Clashes there between police and protesters Sunday left at least three demonstrators injured. Security forces have killed at least 14 protesters since the strike began.
Protesters who tried to cross the road on the eastern edge of Katmandu on Sunday were beaten back by police who first fired tear gas, then rubber bullets, independent Kantipur television reported.
Doctors at a hospital said they treated three people injured by rubber bullets.
Small groups protested inside the city as soldiers patrolled in armored personnel carriers and strung barbed wire to block off some inner alleys and major intersections.
Nearly 250 protesters were wounded in violent clashes with security forces Saturday when they came within a kilometer (a half-mile) of the royal palace.
Protests across the Himalayan country have intensified since Friday, when Gyanendra offered to allow the alliance of seven opposition parties to nominate a prime minister and form a government.
Opposition leaders and the communist rebels say the king's offer to resolve the crisis fell short of a key demand the return of parliament and creation of a special assembly to write a new constitution that could limit or even eliminate the monarchy.

 Kathmandu, 30 September: General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Madhav Kumar Nepal has said that his party has proposed a cease-fire to give Nepalese relief from violence and terror, at least during the Dashain festival.
 ""The government and the Maoists should cease fire at least during the Dashain and Tihar festivals [October-November].

 ""The government may think that the unilateral cease-fire will facilitate the Maoists to regroup and rearm themselves. But if the Maoists attack, then it does not mean that the government cannot retaliate just because it has announced the truce.

Ethiopian, Mozambican and South African troops took off their African Union badges and put on U.N. insignia at a ceremony in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, on Tuesday. The U.N. mandate will last six months and is renewable by the Security Council.
Ambassador Mamadou Bah, the African Union representative to Burundi, said the transfer of authority showed the international community's commitment to ending Burundi's war, which has left more than 250,000 people dead since October 1993, most of them civilians.
Dubbed UNOB, for U.N. Operation in Burundi, the force includes 5,650 soldiers and 120 civilian police and other experts. Troops from Pakistan and Nepal will join the African forces, which first arrived in Burundi in March 2003. The African operation was the first-ever by the African Union.
""The mission will work in an unbiased way till it helps establish a unified army and democratic institutions, said Berhanu Dinka, the U.N. Special Envoy to Burundi.
Burundi's civil war began in October 1993, when soldiers from the Tutsi minority assassinated the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu. The Tutsi elite has controlled the government, military and economy for most of the country's history since independence in 1962.
A peace deal completed last year brought all Hutu and Tutsi political parties into a power-sharing government, as well as the main Hutu rebel group. But one rebel group, the National Liberation Forces, continues to fight and has resisted attempts to start peace talks.
Nevertheless, peace has been established in 16 of Burundi's 17 provinces. Fighting continues around the capital.
At the United Nations, the spokesman for Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the African peacekeeping mission had been successful and had ""laid a solid foundation on which to further advance the peace process.""
""The Secretary-General believes that it is up to the Burundian people and their leaders to take advantage of this significant opportunity of renewed international commitment to Burundi to bring about a durable peace,"" spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement released Tuesday.
""They must now accelerate their efforts and work closely together to address urgent priorities such as preparations for the elections, the disarmament and demobilization of combatants and the reform of the security sector.""
The statement urged the National Liberation Forces ""to join the peace process in the interest of the long-suffering people of Burundi.""
The Secretary-General also called on the international community to contribute generously to the national reconciliation and reconstruction efforts of Burundi.

""My health has improved a lot. Now I will be involved in politics more actively,"" Koirala told reporters on his arrival from Bangkok.
Rebel Maoist leaders arrived in the capital Saturday to speed up peace negotiations and Koirala said he would probably be meeting them in the next few days.
""For the next two days I won't meet Maoist leaders because I have to analyse the political situation and after that maybe a meeting will take place,"" he said.
The 84-year-old premier looked more energetic and refreshed than when he left for treatment on June 17. While in Thailand, he received prostate laser treatment and was given a clean bill of health by his doctor.
""There have been lots of improvements in his health and now he is fit and fine,"" said Shashank Koirala, one of his medical team.
Koirala was appointed prime minister in April, after King Gyanendra was forced to end 14 months of direct rule following mass protests.
Since coming to power, the new government has observed a ceasefire with Maoists and agreed to draft an interim constitution that will see a new interim government containing the rebels.
The government has also agreed to a key Maoist demand, for elections to an assembly that will redraft the constitution permanently and likely remove the king from political life.
Since the rebels began their ""people's war"" in 1996, at least 12,500 people have been killed.

The correspondent for Nepal's largest newspaper Kantipur was released after a team of editors and media rights activists were able to persuade Nepalese authorities to free Harihar Singh Rathor.
Editor of Kantipur, Narayan Wagle - who traveled with the team to the small mountain town of Dailekh, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of Katmandu - said negotiations took longer than expected, but Rathor was released on Wednesday evening.
""We had several meetings with the army, police and local government officials before we were able to persuade them to free him,"" Wagle told The Associated Press by telephone.
Rathor and 14 other independent journalists in the town said they were threatened by government soldiers who were unhappy with their coverage of military operations against the leftist guerrillas, who have a strong presence in the Dailekh area.
The reporters were preparing to leave town when police detained all 15 on Sunday. Fourteen were released on Monday, but Rathor was kept in detention. Police showed him a document Tuesday stating he would be held for six months under anti-terrorism laws.
Wagle said an understanding had been reached with security forces officials that journalists in the area would be allowed to work without being harassed, and both sides would cooperate with each other in the future.
But he added, ""Rathor is going to return to the town and work, but he still faces risks and threats from the security forces.""
Hundreds of journalists have been detained or arrested since February, when King Gyanendra fired the government and took absolute power. About half a dozen reporters remain in jail.
Rathor has reported on the rebels for several years, has good sources among them, and has traveled deep into their territory.
Under anti-terrorism laws, authorities can detain anyone suspected of having ties to the communist rebels for up to a year.
The rebels began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state.

Everest, trekking company officials said Tuesday, hours after the government acknowledged it had deported an American mountaineer caught at the Everest base camp with a ""Free Tibet"" banner.
The government has also ordered a BBC news crew from the Everest base camp, the British broadcaster reported.
The news comes as Nepal, anxious not to hurt relations with Beijing, tries to enforce a strict ban on protests during China's upcoming Olympic torch relay to the summit of the world's highest mountain. Dozens of armed Nepalese soldiers have been posted at Mt. Everest's base camp and at Camp 2, a lower stop for mountaineers.
The border between the two countries cuts across the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit.
Tourism Ministry official Krishna Gyawali said Tuesday that U.S. mountaineer William Brant Holland of Midlothian, Virginia, was expelled from Nepal for violating regulations.
Holland, who left Nepal on Monday for home, was found at the Everest base camp last week with a ""Free Tibet"" banner and told to leave the mountain. When he arrived in the capital, Katmandu, he was questioned by officials, who ordered him to leave the country for violating a ban on anti-China activities.
He has also been banned from all mountaineering activities in Nepal for the next two years.
Holland was the first climber expelled from the mountain to prevent protests during the planned torch relay by Chinese climbers to the Everest summit ahead of this summer's Beijing Olympics.
The relay, expected to start soon, will take place on the Chinese side of the mountain. But Nepal's government, under pressure from Beijing, has posted soldiers on its side and banned climbing near the summit from May 1 to 10.
Police and soldiers have been ordered to stop protests on the mountain using whatever means necessary, including the use of weapons, although the use of deadly force is authorized only as a last resort.
A British Broadcasting Corporation team, meanwhile, was told Monday by Nepalese officials to leave the Everest base camp. A report on the BBC's Web site said they were ""politely but firmly"" told to leave.
Only climbers with permits to climb Everest are allowed to stay in the base camp area.
Soldiers and officials have also banned the use of satellite phones and radios on the mountain, and have forbidden photography at higher elevations, according to the BBC and trekking company employees in Katmandu. The trekking company employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they didn't want to alienate government officials.
Climbers are allowed occasional use of e-mails, but only under the supervision of authorities, the employees said.
Government officials declined to comment on communications restrictions.
Climbers will not be allowed to go past Everest's Camp 2 at 6,500 meters (21,325 feet) until after the Chinese finish their torch run, which is expected to take place in May. The harsh weather on Everest usually allows only two brief windows, normally lasting anywhere from a couple of days to a week, when conditions are favorable enough for the push to the summit.
There are already dozens of mountaineers on Everest for the popular spring climbing season. Climbers spend weeks acclimatizing before attempting to reach the summit. There are even more people on Nepal's southern section of the mountain this season because the Chinese side is completely off-limits to foreign climbers.
The threat of protests on Everest comes from the thousands of Tibetan exiles who have been living in Nepal for years. They have been holding almost daily protests in front of the United Nations office and the Chinese Embassy in Katmandu against Beijing's rule over their region.
Police broke up yet another of their protests Tuesday outside the Chinese Embassy's visa office, detaining 130.
They chanted ""Free Tibet,"" ""China is killer"" and ""China is lying"" as they were taken away by policemen in vans and trucks.
The U.N. and international rights groups have criticized Nepal for using what they say is excessive force in stopping the demonstrations. Police have beaten protesters with batons and dragged them through the streets while detaining them.

Six armed guerrillas entered the state-owned bus, which was parked for the night in the village of Vanipally, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, and drove it to a deserted spot before using explosives to blow it up, said D.S. Chauhan, a police superintendent.
Police were searching for the rebels and had cordoned the area around Vanipally, 175 kilometers (110 miles) north of the state capital, Hyderabad, he said.
The attack took place even though police were on high alert in Andhra Pradesh because of a general strike called by the rebels, who claim the police have executed suspected insurgents - a charge denied by authorities.
The response to the strike was mixed. Shops, schools and offices were closed in remote villages. But in Hyderabad and other big cities, armed police patrolled the streets and offices and businesses were open.
Maoist rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting for more than three decades in several Indian states, demanding land and jobs for agricultural laborers and the poor. The rebellion has claimed more than 7,000 lives since it began in 1981.
The rebels often target police and government officials, whom they accuse of colluding with landlords and rich farmers to exploit the poor.
Monday's blast occurred as top elected officials from nine states where the rebels are active met with federal officials in New Delhi to discuss combating the rebels.
There are also concerns in New Delhi about the growing links between Maoist rebels in India and communist insurgents fighting the monarchy in neighboring Nepal.

Reporters Sans Frontieres [RSF], the international media watchdog, has raised concerns about a series of assaults, threats and coercive measures taken by Maoist cadres against the press in various parts of Nepal.
""Even though Maoist attacks on journalists have considerably decreased compared to previous years, they are nevertheless regular and symptomatic of a failure to tolerate criticism,"" the RSF said in a press release issued on Tuesday.
""On several occasions, and in particular in front of the international mission on press freedom in Nepal, the Maoist party's most senior leaders have sworn their commitment to the freedom and security of journalists,"" the worldwide press freedom organization said. 
""These commitments should be urgently respected in practice. We call on the movement's leaders to bring their militants into line and to show greater transparency,"" it added.
The RSF said that the Maoist cadres have detained assaulted, wrongly summoned or censored at least eight journalists since the return to democracy last April.

 New Delhi, 7 September: Nepal's concerns over Maoist insurgency is expected to be conveyed to Indian leaders by Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba who arrives here Wednesday 8 September on a five-day visit.
 ""The visit would provide an opportunity to comprehensively review, at the highest level, the entire gamut of India-Nepal relations including issues relating to trade, water resources, defence and security and border management,"" the External Affairs Ministry stated here.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 0857 gmt 7 Sep 04
""Our relations are underpinned by a vigorous and intimate contact at the people-to-people level,"" it said. India has offered all possible assistance to Nepal to help it in dealing with the threats posed by Maoists. Nepal has also been rocked by a spate of violent incidents in the wake of large-scale protests over the killing of 12 Nepali hostages in Iraq.
 On his first visit to India after taking over as the head of a multi-party government in June this year, Deuba will be accompanied by wife Arzu and son Jaibeer Deuba during his stay here.

 Excerpt from report by Nepalese Kantipur Television on 18 August
 The citizens of Kathmandu are in confusion and in a state of panic following an indefinite embargo on the capital, called by the Maoists. There has also been anger that people will not be able to leave or enter the capital due to the embargo. However, due to fears of retribution by the Maoists, few people are willing to express their opinion and anger publicly.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13:15 GMT, 18 Aug 04
There was confusion among passengers at exit points and bus terminals in the capital since early this morning as ticket counters were shut and there was no movement of long-distance buses. Only eight buses and six private cars risked the embargo and left the capital today. However, in the afternoon, some 25 vehicles which left the capital were escorted by the army up to 26 km away from the capital. Army sources say, security will be provided in a similar manner for vehicles leaving and entering the capital. However, passengers and bus operators have their doubts about their safety despite the army's assurances. On a routine day anything between 900 and 1,000 vehicles come and go through the Thankot point in the capital. The embargo has not only affected vehicle movement in and out of Kathmandu but has also brought transport to a halt in Nuwakot, Tanahu and Rasuwa and other surrounding areas adjoining the capital.
 Meanwhile, leaders of the ruling parties in government say the embargo on the capital could be a strategic move by the Maoists to pressure the government into peace talks. Talking to Kantipur Television today, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) Bam Dev Gautam said the embargo was going to have a direct effect on the common people but, he said, the doors for peace talks would not be closed due to the Maoists embargo. [passage omitted: repetition of Guatam's remarks]
 Likewise, the leader of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), Narayan Khadka, said, with the Maoist call for an indefinite embargo on the capital, the government must now be serious on holding peace talks.

"5060",20064699,"Title: Indian police chief urges land reform to tackle _naxal menace_.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: March 1, 2006 Wednesday
Text of report by Manoj C.G. and Sumir Kaul, carried by Indian news agency PTI
New Delhi, 1 March: As naxalites increase their attacks on innocent tribals, Director General, Central Reserve Police Force, J.K. Sinha said the so-called naxal movement had been overtaken by criminal elements and had become a new way of making quick money for majority of such groups.
Naxalites operating in several eastern Indian states have taken to land-grabbing and extortion and there are clinching evidences of such activities by them, Sinha said. ""While they have adopted the garb of left-wing politics, look at the activities they are doing. They are trying to grab resources like mining of bauxite, agricultural land and things like that,"" Sinha told PTI in an interview.
Security agencies battling left-wing extremists in Indian states like Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar have found documents pertaining to receipts and payments made by naxalites, he said. ""It is so organized that they keep record of everything -- both payments and receipts. They have entered into such activities as their income sources have dried up,"" he said.
Sinha said though there are reports of stepped up Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] activities in neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh, there was no concrete evidence of linkages between the Pakistani intelligence agency and naxalites on the ground. ""The ISI would try to fish in any troubled water ... [ellipsis as carried] but we have not found evidence of any such linkages on the ground so far,"" he said, adding the possibility, however, cannot be ruled out. 
About tackling the naxal operations, he said the counter insurgency operations of CRPF, which has been given the charge of internal security, were at times affected because of ""haphazard"" communication and intelligence sharing between the agency and various affected states. ""There is a need for setting up an intelligence cell to institutionalise information gathering. Now the whole process in being done in a haphazard manner,"" the CRPF chief said and noted that the agency's role essentially was to assist state Governments in fighting insurgency.
""We need to have a pro-active offensive approach in collaboration with the state intelligence as several attacks on our personnel have shown that we are operating without planning or thinking,"" he said. He also favoured a two-pronged approach - land reforms and empowerment of local population - to deal with the spiralling naxal menace, which has claimed several lives in the last few years prompting the centre [federal government] to form a unified strategy to deal with it.
""Local issues are another key factor. The administration needs to be very, very sensitive in such cases as the naxals jump in support of any issue raised by the local population, gradually taking charge of the situation,"" he said. Elaborating the modus operandi of the ultras, he said most of the explosives they use are locally made and ruled out any ""foreign hand"". ""They have enough educated brains with them,"" he added.

"6856",20081315,"Title: IS UTTARAKHAND'S STATE BIRD FACING EXTINCTION_.rtf; Date: June 4, 2008 Wednesday 5:50 PM  EST; Text: Dehradun, June 04 -- Facing a strong threat perception, Uttarakhand State Bird, the Himalayan Monal, appears to be in distress. The first ever Himalayan Monal count in Uttarakhand has certainly not come up with encouraging results. The Uttarakhand State Bird has touched a figure of 854 in the 2008 census. The monal habitats in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand have certainly been affected even as climate change and poaching continues to hit this pheasant.
For the first time, Uttarakhand Wildlife Department has tried to ascertain the actual presence of its State Bird in the wake of reports of dwindling numbers and fast shrinking habitat. A high altitude bird, the monals in Uttarakhand have their natural habitat in the snow-bound areas of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Nandandevi National Park, Gangotri National Park and other high reaches of the State.
As many as 367 monals recorded their presence in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary while 81 Monals were recorded in the Nandadevi National Park. The Tehri Forest Division recorded as many as 34 monals. The Tons Forest Division in Purola recorded 32 such birds. Pithoragarh Forest Division and Nainital Forest Division recorded 28 and 20 monals respectively. Badkot and Mussoorie recorded two and four monals respectively. Though the State Wildlife authorities are yet to officially release the census findings, they are not looking at the figures with much pessimism. They point out that with limited assets and workforce at their disposal, the figure of 854 certainly does not augur an imminent threat to the pheasant, which of course does not find mention in the Red Data category of pheasants.
Refusing to comment on the outcome of the census, a senior Uttarakhand Wildlife official said the monal count could go up as figures for the other major habitats of monals like Gangotri National Park, were yet to come. He said the total strength of 854 birds could increase further. He, however, made it amply clear that the census was an attempt at finding out the presence of the monal in the State. He also added that the census report that would be released shortly would also include figures for vultures, jungle fowl, peacocks and other birds.
The census outcome certainly comes at a time when there have been increasing reports of Nepal migrant labourers in Uttarakhand being accused of indulging in the monal killings.
""With growing concern over poaching of bigger animals, the poachers at times hunt down monal and other smaller animals rather than going back empty-handed,"" asserted Dhan Singh a Pithoragarh resident.
Population of monals has always been a matter of speculation among the bird lovers of Uttarakhand. Welcoming the census, a birds expert Dhananjaya Mohan added that such census will for the first time bring out the true population of this important pheasant of Uttarakhand.
Interestingly even in neighbouring states of Himachal, no estimation of monals has been done till date. DFO Manali Sameer Rastogi said a survey has even been done in Himachal and appreciated such efforts on the part of Uttarakhand counterparts. The DFO Manali however added that Himachal has submitted a proposal to the Central Government regarding breeding programme for monals. ""Under the programme, we aim to breed monals and leave them into the wild"", he observed.
Himalayan Monal has a distinct position among pheasants due to its prominent build, brilliant plumage and strong association with local folklore. One of the most beautiful birds of the world, the Himalayan Monal is a large heavily built bird and yet it is very gentle and good natured.
With its distribution along the Himalayas from Eastern Afganistan along with North Pakistan to Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh that includes Uttarakhand, Himalayan Monal's importance in the Himalayas can be gauged from the fact that it is also the National Bird of Nepal and was also state bird of Himachal Pradesh till August last year.
Uttarakhand is one of the richest bird areas in the country and harbours as many as 50 per cent of the total bird diversity in the country. It has more than 600 bird species.

 Home Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka has said that the security agencies need to move ahead in an effective manner to give people a feeling of security and to strengthen the security of the nation. Speaking at a Mid-western Regional Security Committee meeting in Surkhet today, he directed the security agencies to coordinate so that security activities become more effective.
Radio Nepal, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 25 Oct 04He said that the security forces need to be mobilized to other parts of the country other than district headquarters as well.  There has been a longstanding criticism that the security forces are stationed only in urban centres while the Maoists control the villages .
 Khadka also directed the regional offices that are yet to be transferred to the Regional headquarters in Surkhet to do so without delay or immediately review the situation and report if it is not possible to do so.  Regional government offices had been transferred to other towns by politicians from the headquarters and had been directed by the king to be brought back to the headquarters during his last year's visit to the region. The minister is apparently executing the king's directive .
 The home minister also told the security agencies and transport entrepreneurs to coordinate their activities to make security checks on the highway less irksome to the travellers.  Harassment on the highways by security personnel in the name of security checks has been a frequent complaint these days .
 On the occasion, the local administrators had apprised the home minister of the security situation in their respective jurisdictions.

A group of around 25 people, believed to be rebels, stormed a local administration office in Patan on the outskirts of Kathmandu and shot dead the policeman who was inside, witnesses said.
Shortly afterwards three blasts shook the office, causing damage, but no injuries, police said.
The two soldiers died Tuesday after being ambushed as they patrolled the western rebel stronghold of Rukum, state radio reported, quoting the defence ministry.
Also Tuesday, four rebels were killed in three gunfights across the west of the Himalayan kingdom, it said.
The radio said five other Maoists were killed last week in southwestern Kanchanpur district when the army attacked rebels and freed a soldier who had been abducted.
A group of Maoists on Wednesday destroyed the village house of former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa in Dhankuda, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) east of Kathmandu, relatives said.
The rebels knocked on Thapa's door and ordered everyone inside to leave before dousing the building with kerosene and detonating a bomb.
The former premier's family told AFP that 12 million rupees (about 153,000 dollars) worth of property was destroyed but that no one was hurt.
Thapa has served as prime minister three times, most recently from 1997 to 1998. He and his immediate family have lived in Kathmandu since he assumed political prominence.
Thapa is affiliated with the right-leaning National Democratic Party, as is Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who was appointed in October after King Gyanendra sacked the elected premier.
The Maoists have been fighting since February 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state.
The ""people's war"" has claimed more than 7,800 lives, according to army figures.

""It is likely that after the election of the constituent assembly our party will be able to form its own government. A government of absolute majority is going to be formed,"" C.P. Gajurel, the Maoist head of international relations, told journalists.
Elections to the constituent assembly, which will rewrite Nepal's constitution permanently and decide the fate of the 238-year-old monarchy, are due to be held by June 2007.
The former rebels have already been granted 73 seats in a 330-seat interim parliament in a deal expected to be approved formally on January 15.
Under the terms of the deal, they will place their weapons and armies under United Nations supervision, paving their way to be recognised as a political party to contest polls.
Despite being poised to enter mainstream politics after ten years of war, the Maoists will remain true to their Communist revolutionary roots, the senior Maoist leader said.
""Since we are Maoists, we have not abandoned Marxism, Leninism, Maoism. We are upholding it,"" said Gajurel, who was released from prison in India late last year.
The party will continue to have ""fraternal"" relations with like-minded groups in other countries, including India, where authorities are battling Maoist insurgents in 15 of 29 states, he said.
""I would like to make clear that the relations between those parties in India are not working relations, only theoretical relations because we have the same ideology. It will not affect relations between the two states,"" Gajurel said.
The rebels have observed a ceasefire for eight months, and Gajurel denied reports that they continued to extort money.
""For the vilification of our party this misinformation campaign has been conducted by certain elements. If there are one or two exceptional cases we are controlling them,"" said the leader.
By next week, an initial force of 35 UN monitors will have arrived in Nepal to begin registering Maoist weapons, the leader of the monitoring mission told AFP.
Nepal's much-criticized King Gyanendra was forced to end direct rule and reinstate parliament in the Himalayan nation in April, after mass protests organised by the rebels and sidelined political parties crippled the country and left at least 19 people dead.

The one-meter (two-and-a-half foot) mask, adorned with turquoise and precious stones, is one of 50 images paraded each year in a special incantation by the Buddhist community of Patan on Kathmandu's outskirts.
The icon of the crowned Buddha, known as the Dipankar Buddha, vanished in January 2002 when it was being kept by a family in Patan.
It resurfaced four months later when a Cologne-based dealer tried to sell it to the Ethnographic Museum in Vienna for 200,000 euros (235,000 dollars), officials said.
Museum curator Christian Schicklgruber suspected the image may have been stolen and started an investigation that led to a theft case being filed in an Austrian court, officials said.
The Austrian government decided to return the icon to Nepal.
""I am very much delighted to hand over the historic Buddhist icon after its 15-month sojourn in Austria,"" Austrian Ambassador Jutta Stefan Bastl said at the function at Nepal's culture ministry.
The Buddha icon was authenticated by Alexander von Rospatt, a scholar of South Asian religion at the University of Vienna and the University of California at Berkeley.
""This is a precious item of major religious significance, not a normal object of commercial trade,"" Rospatt said here.
Nepalese officials have expressed hope that the return of the Dipankar Buddha could trigger the return of more icons that have vanished from Nepal over the years.

 The government says it will increase security to counter the threat by Maoists to close down 12 big industries starting tomorrow. The government announcement comes as the Maoists have called for the closure of the industries for an indefinite period. Speaking to the media at the Department of Information in the capital today, Minister for Information and Communication and government spokesperson Dr Mohammad Mohasin accused the Maoists of trying to create psychological terror among the people but he said the Maoists would not be successful. He also informed the media that the government has done its homework to provide security to the industries which have been called to close by the Maoists. Minister Mohasin said it is illogical for the Maoists to call for the closure of the industries because the trade unions representing the workers in the respective companies are against the closure. He also said closing down the industries does not help the welfare of the workers.
Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 16 Aug 04
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs representing the 12 industries which have been called to close their operations by the Maoists say they will be forced to close down unless the Maoists themselves retract their call. Expressing scepticism over the government's assurance that it will provide security to the entrepreneurs and their industries, they say they will have no alternative but to shut down unless the Maoist aligned trade union withdraws its demand to close the twelve industries. The entrepreneurs have argued that additional security and vigilance does not guarantee the safety of their workers and distributors. They say they are not so much concerned about their economic loss but are concerned about the loss of human lives if they were to defy the Maoists by not closing down their operations.
 Meanwhile, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries has said it has been calling on the government to find a political solution to the Maoists call for the closure of industries. The federation has said if the industries which have national and foreign investments were forced to close down; the government alone would stand to lose more than 10m rupees in revenue each day.
 Human rights organizations have meanwhile said they have been in contact with the trade union aligned to the Maoists and have said should they receive a green light from the government; they were willing to find a solution to the crisis.

"5200",20062611,"Title: Explosion Kills at Least 37 in Baghdad.rtf; Date: September 23, 2006 Saturday 7:16 PM GMT; Text: BAGHDAD, Iraq A bomb claimed by a Sunni Arab extremist group killed at least 37 Shiites in Baghdad on Saturday as they stocked up on fuel for Ramadan, just days after the U.S. military warned that sectarian bloodshed could worsen during the Islamic holy month.
The group said it carried out the bombing to avenge a Friday attack by a suspected Shiite death squad on Sunni Arab homes and mosques that killed four people in a mixed Baghdad neighborhood.
Iraq's armed forces said they struck a blow against groups affiliated with al-Qaida in Iraq, announcing the arrest of a senior leader of Ansar al-Sunnah, a radical Sunni group responsible for attacks on U.S. forces, kidnappings and beheadings.
Al-Qaida in Iraq, meanwhile, put a previously released video on the Internet showing what it said was the group's new leader killing a Turkish hostage two years ago. The statement identifying the masked killer as Abu Ayyub al-Masri couldn't be independently confirmed.
The tape's release was seen as a possible signal by Al-Masri, who was named the group's leader after a U.S. air raid killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in June and earlier this month called on Sunnis to step up attacks on American troops.
A U.S. soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in northern Baghdad, the U.S. command said without releasing any details.
A Danish soldier was also reported killed and eight wounded in a roadside bombing in southern Iraq. He was the fourth Danish soldier to die in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion ousted Saddam Hussein's regime more than three years ago.
The Sunni extremist group Jamaat Jund al-Sahaba Soldiers of the Prophet's Companions claimed responsibility for the bomb attack on Shiites in Sadr City, a sprawling slum that is home to more than 2 million people and a stronghold of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
Police said the bomb went off as people crowded behind a kerosene truck to buy fuel for Ramadan, during which people gather just after sunset for a communal meal to break a daylong abstention from food and water.
Dhiyaa Ali, a 24-year-old college student, said he heard the explosion from his nearby home and ran to the street to help people. He said bodies and blood were everywhere.
""I went into the flames just to get anyone left out of the fire,"" he told The Associated Press. ""I saw a mother holding her child, both of them burned and dead.""
Jamaat Jund al-Sahaba blamed al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia for the Friday attack that killed four people in the Hurryah neighborhood, where a Shiite militia last week openly threatened members of the Sunni minority.
""This operation comes in retaliation for the crimes perpetrated by the Mahdi Army against our Sunni people in Baghdad,"" the group said, warning of more attacks. The authenticity of the statement could not be independently verified.
The killings came on the first day of Ramadan for Sunni Arabs. Shiites, along with the Shiite-led Iraqi government, were expected to declare Sunday as the first day of the holy month, a tangible sign of the differences separating the two Islamic sects.
In Kut, a city 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, eight apparent victims of sectarian death squads were turned in at the morgue. Their bodies had been dumped in the Tigris River.
A top U.S. general warned of the danger of Iraq's already severe sectarian violence could escalate during Ramadan.
Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell, spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition, also said a spike in attacks by al-Qaida in Iraq could be coming after the threat issued Sept. 7 by al-Masri.
The video posted on a Web site often used by Islamic extremists was the first purported appearance of al-Masri since he was announced as the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq this summer.
In a statement accompanying the video, the group said the masked man shown shooting a blindfolded Turkish hostage three times in the head was al-Masri. The video was originally released Aug. 2, 2004, but none of the three militants on it were identified at the time. Iraqi officials claimed a success against the al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Sunnah group with the arrest of a top leader.
Muntasir Hamoud Ileiwi al-Jubouri and two aides were captured late Friday near Muqdadiyah, 56 miles northeast of Baghdad, Brig. Qassim al-Mussawi, spokesman for the General Command of the Armed Forces, told The Associated Press.
The Sunni militant group has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide attacks as well as the August 2004 execution of 12 Nepalese hostages and a December 2004 bombing that killed 22 people at a U.S. military mess hall in the northern city of Mosul.
Insurgent violence continued. In the northern city of Beiji, gunmen threw the decapitated heads of 10 Iraqi army soldiers into a popular open-air market, police said.
Associated Press writers Patrick Quinn, David Rising, Sameer N. Yacoub and Qais al-Bashir contributed to this report.

"7215",20083830,"Title: Singapore says sorry after terror group leader escapes, massive manhunt launched.rtf; Date: February 28, 2008 Thursday 12:47 PM GMT; Text: The Singapore government apologized Thursday for a rare security lapse after an alleged Islamic terror leader escaped from jail, triggering a massive manhunt across the island nation for a man who walks with a limp.
Authorities said Mas Selamat Kastari, who once allegedly plotted to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's international Changi airport, slipped away from a detention center Wednesday. Mas Selamat is said to be commander of the al-Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah's Singapore arm.
Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said Mas Selamat escaped after being taken from his cell to go to a room to wait for his family who were scheduled for a visit.
Mas Selamat, 47, was granted permission to visit the washroom and then escaped, Wong said in Parliament.
""This should never have happened,"" said Wong, who is also the deputy prime minister. ""I am sorry that it had. An independent investigation is under way and we should not speculate on what and how it happened.""
Security breaches are virtually unheard of in Singapore, a small and densely populated island whose sophisticated intelligence system has been liberally used to ensure order and safety.
Among its biggest success was pre-empting alleged plots to bomb the U.S. Embassy, the American Club and government buildings in 2001 schemes in which Mas Selamat allegedly had a hand.
Singapore, a close ally of the United States, was named an al-Qaida target in a transcript from alleged al-Qaida operative Khalid Sheikh Mohamed's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, held last year at the U.S. military detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement that Mas Selamat fled the Whitley Road Detention Center in a wooded residential area in central Singapore. It said he walks with a limp.
""Extensive police resources have been deployed to track him down,"" the statement said. Mas Selamat was not known to be armed, but Wong said he was a security threat.
A security blockade spread out around the detention center. The facility guarded by elite Nepalese Gurkha guards is enclosed by high fences topped with barbed wire. It has closed-circuit television surveillance cameras around its perimeter.
Thousands of police officers and military personnel set up roadblocks to check passing cars. Dozens of riot police and military trucks parked along main roads.
The Gurkhas fanned out in the snake-infested forest nearby, checking vacant bungalows and peering down drains and back alleys of private housing estates.
Students arriving for class at a nearby girls' school were ushered through the gates by teachers and parents to an assembly hall where a school official told them ""not to roam around.""
Security was tightened at the city-state's land, air and sea entry ports, Wong said.
It takes less than an hour to drive from one end of Singapore to the other. The affluent, highly modernized Southeast Asian country is only a short boat ride from Indonesia and Malaysia.
Indonesian security officials said they would work with Singapore to prepare for the likelihood that Mas Selamat might attempt to come over.
Mas Selamat ""would think Indonesia is the safest place"" where it would likely be easier to hide, said Nasir Abbas, a former Jemaah Islamiyah operative who now works closely with Indonesian police.
Malaysia's police chief Musa Hassan said his forces were on the lookout and have informed border authorities, but have made no other special arrangements to tighten border security.
""We have not received any special request from Singapore as yet,"" Musa said. ""We have not sighted him yet.""
Singapore's Home Affairs ministry said Mas Selamat's plane hijack plot was in retaliation for the country's arrest and detention of some of his fellow Jemaah Islamiyah members in a crackdown on the militant group's operatives here.
The alleged schemes were never carried out.
Mas Selamat fled Singapore in December 2001 following the arrests of 13 other suspected Jemaah Islamiyah members.
The ministry's Web site said Indonesian authorities detained him in February 2003 on charges related to possession of falsified identification documents. They deported him to Singapore in February 2006, the ministry said.
Mas Selamat, said to be a father of four, had since been held in custody under Singapore's Internal Security Act that allows indefinite detention without trial.
Since 2002, Jemaah Islamiyah has been blamed for a series of terror attacks that have killed more than 250 people, most of them in Indonesia. Scores of its suspected operatives have been arrested across Southeast Asia since 2000.

"472",20031802,"Title: Hindu monks vow to wipe out practice of human sacrifice.rtf; Date: June 24, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Hundreds of Hindu monks pledged Tuesday to fight ancient barbaric rituals of human sacrifices at temples in India where the grisly practice continues.
""A very miniscule cult still believes that to achieve supernatural magical powers one needs to sacrifice a child at the altar,"" Biswajit Giri, a 45-year-old Hindu mystic, told AFP.
""The practice of human sacrifice … has not died down completely and is being carried out in many select temples secretly.""
Giri is among some 50,000 monks who have assembled at the temple of the Hindu goddess Kamakhya in Guwahati, the capital of the northeastern state of Assam, for the annual Ambubachi Mela, a four-day ritual that began on Sunday.
The Kamakhya temple has long been considered the highest seat of Tantricism, a sort of black magic that has been an integral part of Indias folklore for centuries.
Mystics who gather at the temple claim they can perform wonders -- make a childless couple conceive, find a distressed loner a spouse or cast an evil spell on others.
""We have been working hard to create awareness to stop such grisly human sacrifices and other such heinous occult practices that do not fit into the modern way of life,"" said Birati Baba, a 60-year-old seer who belongs to the secret Aghor cult, whose adherents meditate in graveyards at night.
""We should put an end to all barbaric practices as such incidents defame tantricism.""
Last week, a self-proclaimed mystic with saffron robes and vermillion beads marked on his forehead almost sacrificed his 18-month-old daughter at the Kamakhya temple.
Amritlal Mazumdar was slicing his daughters neck with a razor when her screams of pain alerted devotees who rescued the baby from being sacrificed.
""It seems the man was a lunatic and we managed to save the child from being sacrificed. The man was arrested by police later,"" temple official Tara Nath Sharma said.
""We have deployed special volunteers at the temple to prevent any such bad things from happening,"" he said.
Earlier this year, two children were sacrificed in the northeastern state of Tripura after a devotee had a dream that offering human livs to the deity would lead him to hidden treasures.
Legend has it that human sacrifices -- an integral part of tantricism -- were widespread in Assam and other parts of India although the practice was officially abandoned some 250 years.
""There was a temple called Kasai Kathi (slaughter house) in eastern Assams Sadia area where it was said human sacrifices were performed,"" said Pradeep Sharma, a researcher on tantricism.
""But we have no evidence to prove this as the temple is now razed to the ground after heavy flooding triggered by a killer earthquake that rocked the state in 1950.""
Many of the monks who have assembled here from various parts of India and the neighboring Hindu kingdom of Nepal say human sacrifices continue in many places, although such rituals are steeped in secrecy to avoid public gaze and controversy.
""Human sacrifices are an essential ingredient to appease the goddess and then get her divine blessings,"" said another sage.
""But then nowadays you dont get volunteers for the sacrifice and hence, as something symbolic, devotees perform the ritual using six-foot effigies made of flour.""

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 15 May
Lahan [Siraha district, bordering India, southeastern Nepal], 14 May: As the country concentrates on drafting a new constitution following the historic 10 April election, timber smugglers are making hay in Chure Range. Besides smuggling, locals at several places are now busy tilling land after chopping down trees in the forest area.
According to District Forest Office (DFO) Siraha data, nearly 1,000 ha of forest has been completely destroyed in the district .
Meanwhile, a seminar was organized here in Lahan on Tuesday [13 May] in a bid to curb the deforestation which is at an all-time high according to experts. District forest officers, forest employees, representatives of different political parties and media persons of Siraha, Saptari and Udayapur were present in the seminar. The participants concluded that the main reasons for deforestation were smuggling and vacancy of forest employees at different range posts.
Rambriksha Yadav, the DFO of Udayapur, stressed that forest employees, consumers and representatives of political parties should work together to control deforestation.
In Sarnath area of Sarlahi, the locals fell hundreds of trees in the forest under Murtiya Range Unit for cultivation. Farmers at Ghurkauli, Shankarpur and Rajghat are now busy tilling the land after clearing the forest.
""About 75 per cent [of the] forest under Murtiya Range Unit has been destroyed,"" said Ram Hari Lama, a local at Ghurkauli.
Similarly in Rautahat, deforestation continues unabated as most of the range posts are still without forest employees after the Department of Forest recently transferred 124 employees in the district for failing to control deforestation.

"78",20033311,"Title: Americans in Asia on alert for Iraq war backlash.rtf; Date: February 23, 2003 Sunday; Text: With a new war in Iraq looming on the horizon, US embassies, military bases, schools and companies in the Asia-Pacific region are bracing for a potentially violent anti-American backlash.
Security for hundreds of thousands of US civilians, diplomats and servicemen in the region has been stepped up since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US and last October's Bali bombings, but Washington is taking no chances.
The State Department issued a ""worldwide caution"" on February 6 reminding US citizens of a ""heightened risk"" of terrorist attacks including suicide operations, assassinations or kidnappings. It cited a ""growing threat"" that non-conventional weapons including chemical or biological agents might be used.
With security now hardened at US facilities, Americans were warned that attacks may be aimed at ""softer"" targets such as residential areas, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, outdoor recreation events and beaches.
They have been advised to steer clear of protests, which have taken on a strident anti-American character amid popular opposition to President George W. Bush's threat to attack Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
Various security measures have been drawn up by US facilities in the region against terrorist threats and other emergencies, with host governments providing additional protection:
-- In Singapore, Gurkha sentries help guard the fortified US embassy, the Singapore American School, which has 3,000 students, and the American Club.
The Gurkhas, part of an elite security force from Nepal employed for years by Singapore to help protect its leaders and key buildings, were assigned to protect potential terrorist targets after the September 2001 attacks.
""The situation is being assessed constantly, and should there be a need, the level of vigilance can be stepped up further,"" said Singapore's ministry of home affairs.
There are about 15,000 American residents in Singapore and some 1,500 US companies operate in the city-state, long reputed to be an expatriate safe haven. But complacency was shattered after Singapore said it had uncovered terrorist cells plotting to bomb US and other foreign targets.
Thirty-one men have been arrested on suspicion of being members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a regional group linked to terrorist supremo Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, but others remain at large in Southeast Asia.
-- In Malaysia, some 11,000 to 12,000 Americans are living in the Muslim-majority country, where anti-American sentiment has been fanned by US threats to attack Iraq.
""We're telling people they should always have medical records, school records, financial records, passports and money handy in the event they would have to return to the US immediately,"" US embassy spokesman Frank Whittaker said, but he stressed that ""we have full confidence in the Malaysian government.""
-- In Hong Kong, where some 32,000 US nationals reside, Americans have also been advised to keep vital documents ready.
Police patrol the vicinity of the US consulate, as well as other US institutions, but a police spokesman said the assessed terror risk level remained on the low side of moderate.
-- In Australia, security for the estimated 100,000 American residents has been stepped up since September 2001.
""It has been increased in ways that people can see and in ways that they wouldn't see,"" said an official at the US consulate in Sydney.
He said the consulate and the US embassy in Canberra were protected by police.
-- The Philippines, a former US colony, hosts some 120,000 American nationals. It is troubled by communist rebels and Islamic separatists and bandits.
US embassy spokeswoman Karen Kelley said the mission was continuously evaluating the situation, and the State Department has a standing warning to avoid certain areas where Muslim groups allegedly linked to al-Qaeda operate.
-- An estimated 10,000-11,000 US citizens live in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country. After the Bali bombings in October some 350 embassy staff and families were evacuated and about 95 staffers remain.
The embassy closed for six days last September over a reported threat from the al-Qaeda network. A concrete barricade was installed to seal off part of the main street outside the compound when it reopened.
Leading international schools in Jakarta closed for two weeks last November over reported terrorist threats. They were heavily guarded by armed police and private security staff when they reopened.
-- In largely Muslim Pakistan, where armed militants have targetted Westerners, the US embassy has been without dependents and non-essential staff since March 2002, when a US embassy employee's wife and her daughter were killed in a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad.
The US embassy has tightened security since September 2001, and only a few hundred American citizens remain in the country. The US consulate in Karachi has been operating out of a secret location since August.

The students or their guardians contacted Nepal's embassy in Beijing about leaving and Nepal's foreign ministry is discussing an evacuation with the Chinese government, said Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Ravi Bhakta Shrestha.
""We are looking at various options to bring back the stranded students as early as possible,"" Shrestha told AFP.
One option would be for the Chinese government to provide transport to a city where the students could be picked up by Royal Nepal Airlines, the only airline to offer direct flights to Nepal.
The kingdom's national carrier has suspended flights to Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis. Officials said nearly 180 Nepalese students were stranded in Shanghai because they could not take Royal Nepal flights home.
If the students are brought back to Kathmandu, they would be checked at the airport and quarantined if they are found to be suffering from SARS, Shrestha said.
No cases have been reported in Nepal of SARS, which has killed 219 people and infected 4,560 in China.
Organizers had earlier expressed fear that SARS would bring down attendance of celebrations at the end of May marking the 50th anniversary of the conquest of Mount Everest.
But Ang Tsering Sherpa, head of the golden jubilee celebration committee, downplayed the impact of SARS on the event.
""We are delighted to note that the SARS is gradually declining and hopefully it would not affect the celebration,"" he said.
Nepal has been hoping the Everest anniversary will attract tourism, which was devastated by a Maoist insurgency. The rebels and government have been observing a ceasefire since January 29.

"7221",20083162,"Title: CPI (MAOIST) PLANS TO MAKE SOUTH ASIA HUB OF REVOLUTION.rtf; Date: March 3, 2008 Monday 5:50 PM  EST; Text: New Delhi, Mar. 03 -- The Communist Party of India (Maoist), the key outfit responsible for ultra-Left extremism across the Compact Revolutionary Zone encompassing a corridor from Andhra Pradesh to Nepal with parts of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in its ambit, plans to make South Asia a ""Cyclonic Centre of World Revolution.""
In order to carry forward its international agenda, the outfit has established links with Revolutionary International Movement (RIM) and Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organisations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA), besides links with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
With a view to further intensify its activities, the outfit has shown an increasing tendency to make a common cause with secessionist and fundamentalist organisations, including fringe Islamist groups. The outfit may actively participate in joint programmes with the CPN (M), the Communist Party of Philippines (CPP), the Communist Party of Turkey Marxist and Leninist (TKP/ML) and other like-minded Maoist parties of the world, a senior intelligence official said.
The intelligence agencies have reliable input that KLO and ULFA, the insurgent outfits active in the North East, have joined hands with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The security agencies suspect that the CPN (M) may extend a hand to the ULFA/KLO in their anti-India activities. A Maoist unit named Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist) has been established in the Bhupali (Bhutanese of Nepalese origin) camps in Nepal under the aegis of the CPN (M), the official elaborated.
There is apprehension among the security agencies that this unit could cause considerable problems in the border areas. In the hilly jungle areas of Dooars and Terai, border management for both Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders should be considerably upgraded to deal with the emerging situation effectively, said a senior Union Home Ministry official.
The latest documents suggest that the CPI (Maoist) has cadre strength of 11,455 with another 50,000 over ground cadre. Its weaponry includes AK series rifles, light machine guns (LMGs), rifles, grenades and mortars among others.
The CPI (Maoist) came into being on September 21, 2004 with the merger of the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCC) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Following the merger of the two outfits to form the CPI (Maoist), the movement gained strength both militarily and politically, and 34 Maoist outfits currently have presence in 186 districts across 13 States and violence reported from 91 districts last year.
The Maoist outfits have upgraded weaponry and technology with significant use of remote control and timer devices. The outfits are using improvised rockets and have indigenously developed mortars.

 Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 29 August
 The fifth meeting of information ministers' of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) member countries kicked off in the Nepali capital Monday [29 August].
 His Majesty King Gyanendra inaugurated the meeting amidst a special ceremony organized at the Birendra International Convention Centre (BICC) this morning.
Nepalnews.com website, Kathmandu, in English 29 Aug 05
Her Majesty Queen Komal, chiefs of constitutional bodies, ministers and heads and members of delegations were present on the occasion.
 Addressing the meeting, Minister for Information and Communications Tanka Dhakal said in view of rampant poverty of South Asia, sharing of information in various aspects of development activities in the region could be instrumental in harnessing our potential.
 Minister Dhakal said terrorism continues to be a major irritant for most of us. He said a strong mechanism for all SAARC nations for mutually sharing information on criminal activities could enable them to fight the menace of terrorism within and outside the member countries.
 Addressing the ceremony, Secretary-General of SAARC Chenkyab Dorji said information and communication technologies were vital tools in the process of socio-economic development. He said digital revolution holds great promise for economic development and growth of our countries. He said information technology (IT) can have a major impact in social development by facilitating distance learning at a low cost and by generating employment opportunities and wealth.
 Delivering vote of thanks, Secretary at the Ministry of Communications Lokman Singh Karki defended the royal takeover of 1 February. He said the whole nation was looking at His Majesty the King to bring the situation to normalcy. Karki further said the royal move was taken within the ambit of the country's constitution.

"4060",20052618,"Title: Michael Ward, 80, Doctor On '53 Everest Climb, Dies.rtf; Date: October 25, 2005 Tuesday; Text: Late Edition - Final
 Correction Appended
Michael Ward, an English surgeon and mountaineer who in 1953 was the expedition doctor on the historic ascent of Mount Everest -- and whose discoveries in a dusty archive a few years earlier helped make achieving the summit possible -- died on Oct. 7 at his home near Petworth in West Sussex, England. He was 80.
  The cause was a ruptured aneurism, his wife, Felicity, said.
Considered one of the finest climbers in Britain in the decades after World War II, Dr. Ward later became a renowned authority on high-altitude medicine. For many years a lecturer in clinical surgery at London Hospital Medical College, he practiced in various hospitals in the East End of London.
  Dr. Ward was the author of several books on mountaineering and its physiological effects, among them ''Everest: A Thousand Years of Exploration'' (Ernest Press, 2003) and a memoir, ''In This Short Span'' (Gollancz, 1972). With James S. Milledge and John B. West, he wrote a seminal textbook, ''High Altitude Medicine and Physiology'' (University of Pennsylvania, 1989).
  The highest mountain in the world at 29,035 feet, Mount Everest straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal. During the first half of the 20th century, climbers could approach it only from the north -- the Tibetan side. But after the Chinese invasion of 1950, Tibet was placed off limits to foreigners.
  Around this time, Nepal, which had long been closed to outsiders, began to ease its own restrictions. Cartographers and ethnographers rushed to get in, and so did mountaineers.
  ''Every mountain has at least one way up it,'' Dr. Ward told The Independent of London in 1995. ''We reckoned there must be a route up Everest from Nepal.''
  Michael Phelps Ward was born in London on March 26, 1925. As a boy, he became enthralled with climbing after reading ''Camp Six'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1937), by F.S. Smythe, an account of the unsuccessful British attempt on Everest in 1933. Dr. Ward was educated at Cambridge University and London Hospital Medical College.
  In the early 1950's, Dr. Ward, then a young doctor with the Royal Army Medical Corps, began sifting through the chaotic archives of the Royal Geographical Society. He came upon a cache of aerial photographs of Everest's south face, many taken covertly by the British in the 1940's. He also unearthed a map, known as the Milne-Hinks map, which had been compiled before the war and included what was then known of the mountain's south side.
  A keen reader of mountains, Dr. Ward believed the images showed a clear way to the top. With William Murray, a noted Scottish mountaineer, he approached the Joint Himalayan Committee of the Alpine Club and the Royal Geographical Society. The two men asked the committee to sponsor a reconnaissance expedition up Everest's south face in 1951.
  Dr. Ward was a member of that expedition, which ascended the mountain from the south, picking its way through the treacherous Khmubu ice fall. Also in the party was a young beekeeper and mountaineer from New Zealand named Edmund Hillary. Though the expedition turned back well before the summit, there was no doubt that Dr. Ward had found a viable route.
  Studying earlier assaults on Everest, Dr. Ward concluded that they had failed because the medical consequences of altitude were poorly understood. Of particular concern on Everest were the last thousand feet, which climbers -- even those carrying oxygen -- typically ascended in a sickly stupor.
  Dr. Ward assisted Griffith Pugh, a noted British physiologist, in researching medical aspects of diet, oxygenation and hydration at high altitude. Their recommendations included increasing the supply of oxygen for each climber.
  On March 10, 1953, the historic expedition, led by Col. John Hunt, set out from Katmandu, painstakingly ascending Everest by the route Dr. Ward identified. On May 29, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stepped onto the top of the world.
  Dr. Ward never attained the summit. As the expedition's official doctor, he had to remain some 1,500 feet below, at Camp Seven, on the mountain's Lhotse Face. Besides treating the occasional sore throat, he later said, ''basically I had nothing to do.'' He caught up on Jane Austen and the Brontes.
  In the early 1960's, Dr. Ward took part in the Silver Hut research project in the Everest region. There, he spent months living at 19,000 feet and later lived alone at 25,000 feet, where he pedaled a stationary bicycle to study the effects of altitude. In 1980, he helped lead a reconnaissance expedition to Mount Kongur, a remote, unclimbed mountain in China more than 25,000 feet high.
  Besides his wife, the former Felicity Jane Ewbank, whom he married in 1957, Dr. Ward is survived by their son, Mark, of Los Angeles, and one grandchild.
  In 1983, he was made a Commander of the British Empire.

"7134",20082993,"Title: Nepal king wants to retain a role_ royalist.rtf; Date: May 13, 2008 Tuesday 6:23 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's government has fixed May 28 for the planned abolition of the world's last Hindu monarchy, but the king wants to retain some kind of ceremonial role, a senior royalist politician said Tuesday.
""During my meetings with (Maoist leader) Prachanda, I have said that the king should not be given any political authority,"" said Kamal Thapa, a former royal home minister and unofficial emissary between the Maoists and the palace.
""But he should be given a respectable status that allows him to enjoy his cultural and religious rights,"" Thapa told AFP.
Nepal's former rebel Maoists emerged as the surprise winners in landmark polls last month, garnering 220 seats in the 601-member constitution-drafting assembly -- more than twice the number of their nearest rival.
The ultra-leftists insist that the first meeting of the elected body will end the 240-year-old monarchy, but Thapa believes getting rid of the institution will be dangerous for the impoverished Himalayan nation.
""The country will face a big accident if an abrupt decision is made without alternate mechanisms,"" said Thapa.
""It is logical to end the monarchy only after the drafting of the constitution is finalised,"" said Thapa, the leader of the only royalist party elected to the new assembly, with four of the 601 seats.
The April 10 polls were a key strand of a 2006 peace deal reached between the ex-insurgents and mainstream political parties.
The peace deal ended a decade-long civil war which claimed at least 13,000 lives and wrecked Nepal's already fragile economy.
Once bitter foes, the Maoists and mainstream parties were pushed into an alliance after King Gyanendra took direct control of the country in 2005.
Mass protests forced the king to end direct rule in April 2006.
Since then, he has been stripped of most of his powers, including head of state and head of the army.

"1379",20044402,"Title: Nepal to seek help tackling Maoist revolt, sign pacts with India.rtf; Date: September 9, 2004 Thursday 5:37 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's premier said Thursday he would seek more help from neighbouring India to crush a Maoist revolt wracking his homeland as he began talks with senior Indian leaders in New Delhi.
Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's five-day official visit came amid an upsurge of violence in Nepal as Maoist rebels step up efforts to overthrow the monarchy and impose communist rule in the impoverished nation.
Deuba, 59, said the eight-year-old Maoist insurgency would top his agenda in talks Thursday with Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.
""Understanding, cooperation and assistance from India have a critical bearing on Nepal's fight against terrorism,"" Deuba said before meeting Singh.
""To deal with this challenge, we have to enhance our capability, and India's assistance in this regard has been important,"" the premier, who arrived late Wednesday, told the Press Trust of India news agency.
New Delhi has a vital stake in helping quell the revolt as it is worried Maoist violence could spill into parts of India where ultra-leftist groups are powerful.
Tight security remained in effect on flights between India and Nepal following intelligence reports earlier this week that Maoist rebels could try to hijack an Indian aircraft to spotlight their cause, airport officials said.
Deuba, accompanied by a 66-person entourage, was due to sign a raft of accords later Thursday with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Nepal draws most of its foreign investment from India and Deuba was due to try to reassure Indian businessmen about their safety.
As part of their latest tactics to oust the monarchy, the Maoists vowed to force the closure of 35 companies, including some Indian-run firms, by Friday on top of 12 they shut last month.
Deuba was slated to meet a slew of leaders including Defence Minister P. Mukharji and Home Minister Shivraj Patil.
India, which supplies weapons, military equipment and training to Nepal's ill-equipped security forces, shares a porous 1,600-kilometer- (990-mile) long border with the Himalayan kingdom.
The two countries are expected to discuss stepping up border patrols to stop the movement of guerrillas and arms across the frontier.
The Maoists, who already control vast areas of countryside, last month staged a week-long blockade of Kathmandu that they enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.
India, along with the United States and Britain, has been a vital backer of Nepal in its drive to quell the insurgency that has cost at least 10,000 lives.

"2864",20044347,"Title: Protests banned in Kathmandu after opposition threatens to storm palace.rtf; Date: April 8, 2004 Thursday; Text: Nepal's government Thursday banned demonstrations in Kathmandu and imposed a curfew after opponents of King Gyanendra's rule threatened to storm his palace to culminate a week of mass protests.
The government said it took action after intelligence that demonstrations would be infiltrated by Maoist rebels, who shut down the Himalayan kingdom for three days through Thursday with a general strike.
""In order to avoid bloodshed for the common people, the government has declared Kathmandu a riot-affected area and therefore banned the holding of demonstrations and public meetings of more than five people,"" a home ministry statement said.
""Stringent action will be taken if anyone tries to break this order,"" the home ministry said, adding that weddings and other ""cultural events"" would be exempt from the ban.
The government also imposed a five-hour night curfew in Kathmandu ending Friday morning.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, chief organiser of the protests that have brought tens of thousands to the streets, had earlier threatened that demonstrators would Friday ""cross the barricades to the palace as we enter the final stage in our struggle.""
Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a leader of the five-party alliance demanding King Gyanendra restore democracy, said demonstrators would defy the ban Friday.
""We will go ahead with our protests and we don't care about the consequences. The government order shows its mental vaccuum,"" said Adhikari, a former finance minister.
The king dismissed the elected government for ""incompetence"" in 2002 and appointed his own cabinet. He has been unmoved by the protests, noting there was widespread discontent with corruption and lack of development during the parties' rule.
Amid the furore in Kathmandu, the king has continued a tour of villages in western Nepal, meeting victims of the Maoists who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy.
It was an attempt to storm the palace exactly 14 years ago Thursday that led then King Birendra, King Gyanendra's late brother, to end three decades of absolute royal rule.
King Birendra's palace guards had opened fire on demonstrators who tried to rush the palace in the culmination of six weeks of protests.
The then royalist prime minister, Krishna Bahadur Bhattarai, said at the time that up to 500 demonstrators were killed, although later accounts have questioned whether the death toll was so high.
This year's protests are led by veterans of the 1990 struggle who are furious that King Gyanendra effectively ended their achievement at securing democracy.
The king had on March 28 agreed to hold elections by April 2005, but the parties demanded the vote be held under a ""neutral"" government.
Leading human rights activist Kapil Shrestha said the protests were picking up at a similar pace as 14 years ago.
""Once again we are obliged to take to the streets against the king's steps to thwart the people's sovereign rights,"" Shrestha said.
He noted the protests in Kathmandu were drawing a wide spectrum of society. Among the participants in Thursday's demonstrations were 1,000 handicapped people, who chanted slogans from their wheelchairs as part of a group of Nepalese with disabilities that has joined the protests.
The Maoists have offered moral support to the demonstrations in Kathmandu, saying the two sides needed to come together to defeat the ""feudal forces.""
But the rebels and the democratic parties are far from forging an alliance. Mutual distrust lingers from the time of democratic rule when elected governments deployed the police against the rebels and the guerrillas killed dozens of party activists in the countryside.

'We call on the rebels to join the peace talks without any fear,' chief government negotiator Narayan Singh Pun said in a statement.
As far as the government is concerned, it has made full preparations to initiate the talks aimed at ending the Himalayan kingdom's seven-year-old insurgency, said Pun, who is also minister for physical planning and works.
Soon after the announcement of a ceasefire Jan. 29, the rebels named a five-member team comprising top leaders of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) for peace talks with the government.
But the team has not appeared in public yet as cases against team members, including senior leader Baburam Bhattarai, lie pending at Nepalese courts.
Peace talks have yet to start although the two sides signed a 22-point code of conduct on Thursday last week.
The code enjoins the Nepalese government to provide safety and security to the rebels during negotiations.
Two other rebel leaders -- Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dinanath Sharma -- have, however, recently met leaders of mainstream political parties in a move to pave the way for peace talks.
The rebels, waging an armed insurgency, say they want to try realize their objective of establishing a communist republic in Nepal through a peaceful dialogue.
The violent campaign of the Maoists has claimed the lives of more than 7,200 Nepalese since its outbreak in 1996.

 Correction Appended
Series: THE CONSERVATIVE REACH: First of two articles.
Lawrence W. Reed is one of those people with so much passion for an unusual line of work that he invented a new occupation, and it has helped shape the conservative movement from here to the Himalayas.
  Mr. Reed runs a conservative think tank school. Twice a year, ideological allies from across the globe travel to his program at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Mich., to study the tricks of the idea-peddling trade. Policy institutes have been central to a national organizing strategy that has long won the right a reputation for savvy, and state-level versions are growing in number and clout.
Pushing causes like lower taxes, less spending and school choice plans, they have offered conservatives a base of influence independent of electoral politics. Indeed, after the Republican losses in the midterm elections, many conservatives said this carefully tended world -- of research organizations, single-interest groups, foundations and publications -- was vital to the movement's revival. 
  Mr. Reed has nurtured so many state policy groups that he has been called the movement's Johnny Appleseed. But a competing metaphor is sometimes invoked, that of a restaurant chain. His school is part of an extensive system of support, a national back office of sorts, that allows even policy novices to produce abundant, salable fare.
  Consider the experience here in Kentucky, where the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions has made enough noise for the state's largest newspaper to call it a ''conservative propaganda mill.'' Its founder, Christopher J. Derry, was a sales executive with no public-policy background when he attended Mr. Reed's school three years ago. He left with access to everything from off-the-shelf speeches and papers to management software.
  ''This is like a franchise,'' Mr. Derry said. ''I saw that I could recreate what the other state groups are doing.''
  No one is more central to this replicating effort than Mr. Reed, who combines libertarian ardor with a demeanor so earnest it approaches guilelessness. He said he first felt called to ''the liberty movement'' as a 12-year-old watching the ''The Sound of Music,'' and was a high school sophomore when he burned his first Soviet flag.
  He attributes the Republican losses in last week's election to party's failure to cling to its small-government philosophy and argues the drift shows the need for groups like his. ''This underscores the importance of investing in ideas first and foremost, because politicians will almost always disappoint,'' Mr. Reed said.
From Michigan to Mongolia
  As a full-throated advocate of capitalism -- the jagged, creative-destructive kind -- Mr. Reed says he is used to being called a corporate apologist who would despoil the environment and afflict the poor. But he sees himself as a defender of free markets and free men, claiming among his major role models Thomas Clarkson, a 19th-century British abolitionist whom Mr. Reed regards as the world's first think-tank entrepreneur. ''Clarkson championed our movement's overarching principle: If there's anything certain in human affairs, it's that liberty will prevail,'' he said.
  From Midland, Mr. Reed runs Mackinac (pronounced MAK-in-aw), the largest of the right's state-level policy institutes. The center started its training program eight years ago, and it has alumni in nearly every state and 37 countries, from Uruguay to Nepal. Among them was a Mongolian who went on to become prime minister, putting his free-market training to work by privatizing the national herd of yaks.
  When the Mackinac Center was founded in 1987, there were just three other conservative state-level policy institutes. Now there are 48, in 42 states, joined in an association called the State Policy Network. At least three former Mackinac presidents are now in the House, Representatives Mike Pence of Indiana, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, all Republicans.
  Collectively, the groups have pushed for cuts in health and welfare programs, constitutional limits on state spending, and expanded school choice programs. They have opposed what they call burdensome health, safety, and environmental regulations and increases in the minimum wage. 
  In labeling the institutes (and himself), Mr. Reed prefers the term ''free market'' over ''conservative,'' since most of the groups stress economics over social issues.
  In Colorado, the Independence Institute has been a leading force behind a constitutional spending cap called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. In Arizona, the Goldwater Institute has championed a school-choice law that sends 22,500 children a year to private schools. The Texas Public Policy Foundation helped pass a law to end what the group said were excessive lawsuits.
  ''In terms of generating and popularizing ideas, I think they've been very effective,'' "

 Kathmandu, 16 October: Home Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka has called upon journalists not to report in such a way that encourages terrorism.
 Speaking at a function organised at Police Headquarters to mark Police Day 2004, Home Minister Khadka, directing his words to the journalists, reiterated - ""Do not use your pen to prop up terrorism.""
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 17 Oct 04Minister Khadka asked journalists to think about the plights of the widows, orphans and the displaced people, victimized by terrorism, and write in such a way that lowers the morale of terrorism.
 If the shortcomings of an individual are generalized, the morale of the whole police organization would be affected. This has had adverse impact on the campaign against the Maoists, he said.
 ""The central basis of the talks with the Maoists must be the issues of constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy"", he said. ""No one can obliterate the achievement of the democratic movement of 1991. It is a mistake to say that such a statement is going to disrupt the talks. This in no way will negatively affect the talks,"" he said.
 On the occasion, Home Minister Khadka honoured the family members of the police personnel killed in the battle against the Maoists.

Dhaka meteorologists warned Monday that Bangladesh's coldest winter in years, which has killed 540 people since mid-December, was tightening its icy grip after offering a short respite.
""The cold spell is easing slowly, but another one is likely to sweep the country by the end of this week, but not as severe as the one in the past days,"" a state meteorologist said.
The dense fog that has shrouded the country for the past week and disrupted transportation would remain for some time, he warned.
There was no sun for Dhaka again Monday as the mercury remained around 11 degrees Celsius (51.8 Fahrenheit).
The lowest temperature recorded Monday was 6.4 degrees Celsius in southwest Pabna district's Ishwardi.
Most of the 540 people who have succumbed to the cold were young, elderly or ailing.
Millions of Hindus in India's frozen north began praying Monday for an end to the cold wave, hoping the annual Lohri festival to mark the start of spring would make the sun shine brighter, officials said.
Weather experts, however, poured cold water on the hopes of the millions who on Monday prepared Lohri bonfires, warning the chilly temperatures were likely to last.
""We don't expect the cold wave to subside in the next two days at least,"" Nothern Hemisphere Analysis Centre Director Onkari Prasad said in Delhi, where temperatures crashed to 3.7 degrees Sunday.
""But we believe that Lohri, which is also the beginning of our harvesting season, will wipe out the cold and tomorrow we will see the sun dance in the skies,"" said R.P. Tandon, a Lohri organiser.
Heavy fog Monday made for a gloomy day in the northern states of Haryana and Punjab, disrupting rail, air and road traffic, officials said in the joint capital of Chandigarh.
All of northern India has suffered prolonged brown-outs for the past two weeks as electricity consumption shot up by 15 to 20 percent amid cold-related demand, power ministry officials said.
The shivering eastern Indian state of Bihar on Monday reported 54 more deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the national cold wave toll to at least 518.
State authorities have begun to dole out blankets to Bihar's poorest, many of whom have moved to schools and government buildings to shelter from the wind-aided cold wave, officials said.
In adjoining Uttar Pradesh, the industrial city of Kanpur last week recorded an all-time low of zero degrees Celsius.
On Monday, Kanpur and adjoining areas continued to grapple with bad weather as the mercury hovered at three degrees Celsius.
Thick fog blurred once-bustling Kanpur and icy winds from the Himalayas fractured road and train traffic, the Press Trust of India reported.
In Nepal, 41 people, many of them former child workers, have died this month in a bitter cold wave sweeping the Himalayan kingdom, state radio said Monday.
Exposure to the cold in the southwestern Terai region, a populous and largely poor lowland area bordering India, was responsible for their deaths.
This winter has been particularly harsh in the Himalayan kingdom, with temperatures Monday at one degree Celsius in both the Terai and the capital Kathmandu.
Nepalese radio said 11 of the 41 people who died of cold were children released from bonded labor last year.
Up to 60,000 bonded laborers, condemned to work like slaves by generations-old tradition, were declared free last year by the government.

In his first foreign trip since taking over the post last month, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh arrived in the capital Katmandu for talks that are expected to include security issues and a growing communist insurgency in the Himalayan kingdom.
""The first priority of our foreign policy is further improving and strengthening our relations with our neighbors,"" Singh told reporters.
""It is no coincidence that Nepal is the first country I am visiting after assuming office. It reflects the importance we attach to Nepal and our desire to consolidate and further develop our already wide-ranging ties.""
Singh's visit comes at a time of political turmoil and insurgency in Nepal.
The Himalayan nation got a new prime minister Wednesday, when the king reappointed Deuba, who was ousted from the top job two years ago, hoping to end a political crisis that has sparked huge demonstrations in recent months demanding that the monarch restore democracy.
Gyanendra accused Deuba in 2002 of failing to end a Maoist insurgency. The king dissolved Parliament, assumed executive powers and appointed a monarchist government.
Nepal has been fighting a Maoist insurgency since 1996, which has claimed more than 9,500 lives.
On Thursday, Indian police in the eastern city of Patna arrested 10 Nepalese citizens who are suspected leaders of Nepal's Maoist rebel group. The six are members of the guerrillas' central committee, its highest decision-making body, said rebel leader Prachanda.
The detentions are a boost for Nepal's government, which has been struggling to contain the growing insurgency.
India is providing military hardware to Nepal to fight the Maoists, who have close links with communist rebels operating in India's east and south.
A large number of people in Nepal, a landlocked country that is heavily dependent on foreign aid, study or work in India. However, they resent what they see as India's ""big brother"" treatment toward Nepal.

The funds, the largest such aid flow since the peace process began more than a year ago, will be used as compensation for families of the 13,000 people killed in the civil war and for the allowances of some 20,000 Maoist former guerrillas confined to UN monitored camps, the World Bank statement said Wednesday.
""In this pivotal moment in Nepal's history it is important to take concrete steps to consolidate the peace process and to ensure that development and service delivery are scaled up,"" said Susan Goldmark, World Bank country director for Nepal.
As part of the peace deal, families are to receive around 1,500 dollars for each relative killed, and the former fighters in the UN-monitored camps are supposed to receive an allowance of 46 dollars per month.
Nepal's decade-long civil war ended in a late 2006 peace deal. The conflict decimated the already fragile economy of the aid-dependent Himalayan nation, one of the poorest countries in the world.
In addition to the 50 million for ""emergency peace support"" the World Bank approved other funding for the health and water sectors totalling 77 million dollars, the bank said in its statement.
Nepal's Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 aiming to topple the monarchy and establish a communist republic.

Communist rebels, meanwhile, took 28 hostages in a raid on a southern town that left at least 13 people dead.
The government ordered troops across Nepal to do whatever was necessary to foil the protests and strike against King Gyanendra's power grab last year.
Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters rallied across Katmandu and a suburb, Lalitopur. They fled from police shooting tear gas, chanting ""We want democracy. Down with autocracy.""
Students leaders, women's activists and members of Nepal's seven main political parties were among those arrested in Katmandu, protest leader Khadga Prasad Oli told The Associated Press. He said at least 16 different protests took place in the city.
Home Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey confirmed some arrests were made, but said the exact number was being determined. He said protesters hurled stones at cars on the roads, damaging eight vehicles. ""The situation is quite normal. There is no law and order problem,"" he said.
The strike, called by the seven political parties, was backed by communist rebels, whose decade-long fight to oust the king underlies the political crisis.
""The streets are empty. There are no vehicles. I walked for half an hour to get to work,"" said Manisha Shahi, who works at a hotel near the royal Narayanhiti Palace in Katmandu. ""But it is not safe to walk, too. Anything could happen.""
The king argues he was forced to seize power last February because of the growing insurgency, which has killed some 13,000 people since 1996. He has been under international pressure to restore democracy, including from the United States, Britain and India.
Soon after taking power, the king imposed a state of emergency and clamped restrictions on the media. Although the emergency decree was lifted, the government has continued to crack down on opposition politicians and activists.
A State Department report released this week said Nepal's human rights record had worsened and criticized the king's restrictions on the press and political activists.
The rebels pledged not to stage attacks in Katmandu during the anti-government rallies, but they continued their violent campaign in the countryside.
In Malangawa, about 75 miles south of Katmandu, rebels bombed government buildings and raided security bases late Wednesday, police official Rajan Limbu said. The militants took a local official and 27 policemen hostage and freed jailed comrades, he said.
Six policemen, five rebels and two civilians were killed, a police official said on condition of anonymity for security reasons.
A Russian built M1-17 army helicopter crashed during the fighting, and rebels claimed they had shot it down. The Royal Nepalese Army said it was investigating the incident. The status of the crew was unknown.
Despite the rebels' pledge not to attack in Katmandu, the government cited fear of terror strikes in the capital as a reason for cracking down on the protests.
""We don't quite believe what the Maoists are saying. If any untoward incident happens, it will be too late to repair,"" Information Minister Shrish Shumshere Rana told the AP. ""Just because they have said there is a brief holiday for terror, it doesn't mean we believe them.""
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized the crackdown Wednesday in a statement released through his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.
""While maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the state, security considerations should not be the basis for denying citizens their right to peaceful protest a right for which virtually all avenues seem to be closing,"" Dujarric said.
Ahead of the start of the four-day strike Wednesday, police detained about 75 pro-democracy activists who defied a ban on rallies in the capital, including several journalists.
The city also imposed an overnight curfew. Soldiers patrolled the streets, and cars entering the capital were searched to ensure political activists did not enter.
Political parties denounced the tough measures.
""There is no basis for the government's actions. I am absolutely confident there will be no violence unless it is provoked by actions of the security forces,"" said Ram Sharan Mahat, a senior leader of the Nepali Congress, the largest party.

Gyanendra was forced to end his absolute rule and reinstate parliament in the Himalayan nation late last month, after weeks of mass protests in which 19 protesters died and hundreds were injured.
""The commission which was formed on Friday by the new cabinet has been mandated to submit its report within two months,"" lawyer and panel member Ram Kumar Shrestha told AFP.
Human rights groups in Nepal and internationally have accused the army, police and Maoist rebels of serious abuses including abductions, killings and extortion. 
The commission however is not slated to review rights abuses by the rebels, but only by the security services during the 14 months of Gyanendra's direct rule.
Opposition parties in concert with the Maoists claimed a ""people's victory"" over the monarch. The new government and rebels have both declared ceasefires and outlined plans to form a constituent assembly, a body to amend the constitution and clip the powers of the king.
""The commission has the right to issue warrants, interrogate and recommend to the government the action that should be taken against the perpetrators, if found guilty,"" said Shrestha.
Under the terms of reference, the five-member commission will ""recommend and advise on action to be taken against those responsible for abuse of power, state funding and human rights violations and cases of loss of life and property by the royal government.""
Gyanendra sacked the government on February 1, 2005, and took direct control until April 24, 2006 when he bowed to the protests and returned power to parliament.
""We will work without any prejudice and recommend the government as per our findings. It is up to the government to take action against those found guilty, as per the existing laws,"" said Shrestha.

"7786",2011377,"Title: Strong quake hits northeastern India ; 9 dead.rtf; Date: September 18, 2011 Sunday 3:52 PM GMT; Text: A strong earthquake shook northeastern India and Nepal on Sunday night, killing at least nine people, damaging buildings and sending lawmakers in Nepal's capital running into the streets.
The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, was felt across northeast India including the capital of New Delhi. It triggered at least two aftershocks of magnitude 6.1 and 5.3, Indian seismology official R.S. Dattatreyan said. He warned more aftershocks were possible.
At least four people in India's Sikkim state were killed and an unspecified number of people were injured, state police Chief Jasbir Singh told The Associated Press. Nepal's government said five people died and dozens were hurt there.
The full extent of damage was not immediately known because the region is sparsely populated with many living in remote areas which were cut off by mudslides triggered by the quake, Singh said.
TV stations reported buildings collapsed and sidewalks cracked in Sikkim's state capital of Gangtok, 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of the quake's epicenter. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police said two of its buildings had collapsed in Gangtok.
Rescuers were working overnight to search for anyone pinned under fallen buildings in the city, which has a population of 50,000, Singh said.
""We have sounded a high alert. Police are on the streets in Gangtok and other major towns,"" he said.
Electricity and some phone service was interrupted in the area.
Power lines snapped in the West Bengal cities of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which ""are now in total darkness,"" state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered to send troops to help, and summoned the National Disaster Management Authority for an emergency meeting. The air force sent five planes to help with rescue efforts.
In neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh, the quake sent residents rushing out of their homes, offices and shopping centers.
In Nepal's capital of Katmandu, members of parliament who were debating the national budget ran out of the assembly hall into a parking area. They returned 15 minutes later and resumed their session.
The quake was also felt as far as the Indian capital, with New Delhi residents also rushing out of shaking buildings.
Associated Press writers Binaj Gurubacharya in Katmandu, Nepal, and Julhas Alam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, contributed to this report.

Gyanendra has asked for additional police to be posted at the Narayanhiti royal palace on Saturday the main day of celebration Home Ministry spokesman Baman Prasad Newpane said.
Student unions affiliated to the main political parties have announced plans to hold protest rallies and to try and prevent people from entering the palace.
The groups alleged in a statement that the king's gathering was a conspiracy against recently restored democracy and an attempt to disrupt upcoming national elections.
Hundreds of people have been invited to attend, but government ministers and key foreign envoys in Nepal from the United States, European Union and India have announced plans to boycott the party.
Gyanendra angered many Nepalese when he seized absolute power in February 2005, sacked an interim government and took control of Nepal's government. He was forced to give up his authoritarian rule in April 2006 following months of pro-democracy protests, and remains deeply unpopular.
He has also been stripped of his powers and command over the army.
A special assembly to be elected in November will decide on the fate of the monarchy.
Gyanendra became the king in 2001 after his elder brother, Birendra, and eight members of the royal family were assassinated in a palace massacre.

""We are at the final stage of deploying monitors, but the camp commanders are in opposition. They say they have yet to receive an order from party high command,"" a non-Maoist member in the SC Secretariat told THT.
Maoist commanders, especially Maoist representatives in the Secretariat Chandra Prakash Khanal and Kul Prasad KC, have taken exception to deployment of monitors at satellite camps saying they needed an order to this effect from the party high command.
The objection though is in violation of a Special Committee, a peace mechanism of major parties, including the Maoists, decision of March 23, which had unanimously directed the SC Secretariat to hire and deploy 433 monitors and other staff to ensure supervision of all the 21 satellite camps. ""It seems PLA fighters' handover to the Special Committee is just a myth,"" added the Secretariat member. Secretariat Coordinator Balananda Sharma agreed that monitor deployment process had been stalled to due to PLA fighters' objection. He called upon all concerned to cooperate to carry forward supervision, integration and rehabilitation process of Maoist combatants.
Though PLA fighters were formally handed over to the Special Committee, headed by the prime minister, amid a special function in Shaktikhor, Chitwan, on January 22, the Maoist ex-fighters living in 21 satellite camps are yet to come under the SC ambit.
Combatants of seven main PLA cantonments, however, are being supervised by SC monitors.
Khanal even questioned the relevance of the Special Committee decision.
""Even the United Nations Mission in Nepal did not
supervise the satellite camps for four years. Then why now?"" said Khanal. He also argued that it was not mandatory for them to abide by the SC decision.
Non-Maoist members, however, said the Maoists' stubborn attitude reflected their fear that monitoring would expose their wrongdoings they commit inside camps.
To ease the UNMIN's departure, the then Nepali Congress-UML government and the Maoists had agreed to deploy Special Committee monitors at 21 satellite camps to supervise the PLA fighters living there.

Speaking to state police chiefs and intelligence officials on Thursday, Chidambaram said the two recent bomb blasts in Mumbai and Delhi are a ""blot"" on the government's record but the context of India's proximity to Afghanistan-Pakistan made it vulnerable.
Chidambaram said terrorist groups based in Pakistan continued to target India, but Indian modules were a reality as were groups that espouse the cause of right-wing religious fundamentalism or separatism. Many of them, he said, have acquired the capacity to make bombs.
On the crucial aspect of capacity building to tackle terrorism, he said the most important ""unfinished agenda"" is NCTC. ""I hope to secure a government decision on setting up the NCTC. Once there is a decision, I am confident the core team of NCTC can be installed within 60 days and the full structure can be put together within 12-18 months.""
Pointing to the wide arc of threats India needs to deal with, Chidambaram said: ""There is no let up in attempts to infiltrate from across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Besides, there are attempts to infiltrate terrorists via Nepal and Bangladesh into India as well as find a safe transit route from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu.""
He said Af-Pak is epicentre of terror and home to three Pakistan-based groups that target India - Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hijbul Mujahideen. ""There are Indian modules too. They seem to have the capacity to attract radicalised youth. Some modules are loosely knit under an organization called Indian Mujahideen. Many old cadres of the banned SIMI have morphed into IM cadres.""
Referring to the threat of Hindutva groups, the home minister said: ""There are other Indian modules that espouse the cause of right-wing religious fundamentalism or separatism. Many of these modules have acquired the capacity to make bombs.""
On the Delhi and Mumbai blasts, he said: ""Naturally, the central government and security forces have been severely criticised. While we accept responsibility for the incidents and the legitimate criticism, it is our duty to set out the context in which such terrorist attacks take place.""
The home minister said no country in the world, including the United States, appears to be entirely immune to the threat of terror, the worst-affected being Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
While listing out the steps taken by the government to build capacity to deal with all kinds of threats after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, he said, ""Have we done enough to build capacity since the Mumbai terror attacks? The answer is yes and no.....we have not done enough…there are still over 5,00,000 vacancies in state police forces.""

 Kathmandu, 10 October: The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) is planning to increase its strength to at least 85,000 by recruiting 6,000 soldiers soon. The Defence Ministry has already sent documents for the same to the Finance Ministry for approval.
 ""Once the Finance Ministry gives its nod, the proposal will be sent to the cabinet for approval,"" said an official at the Defence Ministry. According to him, the Finance Ministry will study the feasibility of the proposal.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 11 Oct 04
The army's second 10-year-plan that was formulated last year plans to increase its strength to 100,000. With the formation of two new division headquarters in Dipayal and Hetauda, and brigade headquarters in all the zones, the need to increase the army's strength has become more urgent. A senior RNA official said: ""About 40 per cent of the officers' posts are vacant at present because of the longer period of training for officers.""
 There are a few vacant positions for the rank of brigadier-generals and major-generals. Division commanders are learnt to have been complaining about the scarcity of officers.
 The estimated budget for increasing the strength will be about 6bn rupees. ""As the Finance Ministry does not release the budget at once, the RNA plans to increase its strength only up to 85,000 this year. It will be gradually increased to 100,000,"" said an army source.
 The proposal was sent to the Defence Ministry last Monday 4 October and the Defence Ministry had quickly responded to the proposal sending it to the Finance Ministry. ""Not a single penny has been allocated for the newly formed divisions because the government had directed the RNA to from them within the current resources,"" said a senior army official.
 Meanwhile, the RNA has started recruiting women officers for infantry units for the first time. According to Directorate of Public Relations, over 800 aspiring women have applied for the post of infantry officers. However, the number of women infantry officers is not yet known because ""only those who pass the test will be recruited"".
 Apart from the Kathmandu Valley Command Division, the other RNA regional headquarters are situated in Nepalgunj (far western region), Pokhara (western region) and Itahari (eastern region).
 ""The strength is being increased and the old weapon system is being replaced by a new system in the RNA's efforts to counter the ongoing insurgency,"" the official said. The RNA is currently equipped with weapons like US-made M-16 rifles, INSAS rifles, Belgium-made Minimi machine guns, light machine guns, sub-machine guns, SLRs, general purpose GPMG, 2"" mortars, rocket launchers and pistols.

Don't blame coach Bob Houghton, therefore, for being keen on using their services in the AFC Challenge Cup.
But Gawli wasn't fit to start against Afghanistan and now Mondal, blighted by another injury, is likely to miss the remaining two league games. The Mohun Bagan defender limped off in the 81st minute against Afghanistan after injuring his knee, forcing Houghton to rush in Gawli as reinforcement.
India won 1-0 and a win on Friday against defending champions Tajikistan would seal a place in the last-four stage. Houghton confirmed after Thursday's training session that Mondal would not play against Tajikistan but was non-committal about his availability for the last league game against Turkmenistan.
Mondal has been advised rest for a few days as it was his left knee that kept him out for over seven months since the Nehru Cup last year. The 29-year-old also had his right knee operated in 2005 following a ligament tear.
However, Houghton would be relieved that Gawli played for the last 10 minutes and now he looks good to start on Friday. ""I put Mahesh in to just test him and he should start against Turkmenistan. Even Steven (Dias) is fit to play tomorrow's game,"" he said. It is possible that Dias would come in for Bungo Singh and Baldeep Singh (Jr) replace N.P. Pradeep on Friday.

Substitute Myo Ming Tun doubled the score with a scorching left-footer from the edge of the box after a solo run in the 76th minute and Soe Myat Min rounded off the tally 10 minutes later.
However, the day belonged to Korean midfielder Pak Song-Chol who first curled in a 20-yard free-kick in the ninth minute and added another three minutes before the half-hour mark.

Nepal's royal government on Saturday freed two senior opposition leaders who were arrested a day earlier, the Communist Party of Nepal said.
Jhala Nath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam, both of the Communist Party of Nepal, were freed and driven by police to the party office Saturday, the party said in a statement.
They arrived at the office just before officials from the party met to discuss King Gyanendra's proposal to give up powers he seized last year and calling on the opposition to form a government.
Khanal was detained as he arrived in Katmandu on a flight from India, and Gautam when he tried to get on a flight in southern Nepal to return to the capital.
The two men have been important conduits in negotiations between Nepal's seven main opposition parties which include their party and the Maoist insurgents who control much of the countryside.

"1350",20042122,"Title: Nepal Maoists impose controls on villagers, NGOs.rtf; Date: December 17, 2004, Friday; Text: Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 17 December
 Makwanpur central Nepal : Maoists have intensified their activities after the government established the army's central division in Hetauda south of Kathmandu Valley to strengthen security. The administration announces a curfew from 9.00 p.m. all times local , but the Maoists impose their curfew in the villages from 6.00 p.m. It is the people who are victimized by these dual rules.
 Contact between the villages of Makwanpur and its headquarters, Hetauda, is diminishing because of army patrols on the highways and increased Maoist activity in the villages. The people are persecuted by the security forces when they go into town and by the Maoists when they return to their villages, in the name of inquiries. This is how they have been facing dual hardship because of the armed conflict.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 17 Dec 04
The Maoists of Lalitpur-Makwanpur have intensified their organized activities at the moment. They have prohibited vehicles from running in Chhatiwan, Faparbari and other villages of eastern Makwanpur after 6.00 p.m. People have lost the initiative to go to the district headquarters to buy their daily necessities as they have been banned from selling their own farm products, which provided their sole earnings.
 The Maoists have allowed only the sale of vegetables that exceed consumption needs in the villages themselves and which cannot be stored. Such trading is only allowed on Sundays and Thursdays. They have also made new arrangements to register and seek permits for the entry of vehicles into the villages.  All the passenger buses running from the town to the villages are made to pay 5,000 rupees while trucks are charged 3,000 rupees as registration fees.
 The Maoists, in the name of Revolutionary People's Council, have declared all schools and community forests as illegal, while they have prohibited NGOs from working in the villages. The NGOs have not been able to enter the villages since they were told by the Maoists they had to register with and obtain entry permits from the village people's government.
 Maoist Area Nos 4, 5 and 6 of Lalitpur-Makwanpur have been put under curfew from 6:00 p.m., affecting Chuchche Khola area and Chaugadha of Hetauda. The Maoists look into cases within the villages through their own People's Courts. Cases of burglary, robbery, and rape in the villages have been settled by the Maoists themselves by sentencing the guilty to labour camps and even capital punishment.
 The Maoists are on a nationwide campaign to change the mind-sets of the village people and form public opinion for revolutionary transformation, strategic offensive and countering foreign intervention.  The programme, known as the Tri-Focal Campaign, was inaugurated by Maoist central member Kamal in Raigaun.
 The Maoists have also been engaged in development works in the presence of their central leaders. The 48-metre-long bridge at Faparbari was constructed with 300,000 voluntary man-days. Maoists claim that they are carrying development activities in the name of their martyrs by painting the bridge with red enamel. The Maoists have also constructed a road in Hadikhola.

"6454",20072766,"Title: Sri Lankan peacekeepers in Haiti sex scandal.rtf; Date: November 3, 2007 Saturday 2:03 AM GMT; Text: More than 110 Sri Lankan peacekeepers serving with the UN mission in Haiti are to be sent back home over charges that they sexually exploited people, including minors, in the impoverished nation, the United Nations said Friday.
It was the latest in a series of such scandals to besmirch the world body.
The accused from Sri Lanka's 950-strong contingent in the UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) ""will be repatriated on disciplinary grounds on Saturday,"" UN spokeswoman Michele Montas said in a statement.
Nick Birnback, a spokesman for the UN department of peacekeeping operations (DPKO), said 111 soldiers and three officers would be sent home, updating an earlier figure of 108 given by Montas.
Montas said the action was ordered ""following allegations of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse by members of MINUSTAH's Sri Lankan Battalion stationed in a number of locations in Haiti.""
The decision was made after a preliminary report by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and with the cooperation of Sri Lankan authorities.
Montas said MINUSTAH had requested the OIOS investigation and said Sri Lanka also sent a high-level national investigative team from Colombo, including a female investigative officer.
""The United Nations and Sri Lanka take this matter very seriously and reiterate their shared commitment to both the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to best practices in peacekeeping,"" the UN statement said.
""The United Nations and the Sri Lankan government deeply regret any sexual exploitation and abuse that has occurred, despite their efforts to ensure the highest standards of conduct and discipline,"" it added.
Birnback hailed the fact that the Sri Lankan government accepted full responsibility and decided to be ""as transparent and as cooperative"" as possible.
""We think it's a positive development,"" he told AFP.
Montas meanwhile said that some of the Haitian women involved in the sex-for-money scandal were minors.
The case is the latest to hit UN peacekeepers who have been embroiled in similar incidents in Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) and Liberia.
The UN -- after turning a blind eye for decades to cases of sexual abuse by its peacekeepers -- recommended in 2005 that erring soldiers be punished, their salaries frozen and a fund established to aid any women or girls made pregnant. 
This was part of a ""zero tolerance"" policy regarding sexual misconduct, including a ""non-fraternization"" rule that bars UN peacekeepers from having sex with locals.
The policy was adopted after revelations in December 2004 that peacekeepers in DRC were involved in the sexual abuse of 13-year-old girls in exchange for eggs, milk or cash sums as low as one dollar.
Most of the nearly 100,000 troops serving in UN peacekeeping operations around the world cannot be disciplined by the world body as they are answerable to troop-contributing countries, UN officials said.
Under Brazilian command, MINUSTAH currently deploys 7,054 troops and 1,771 police officers in Haiti. The mission began after then-Haitian president Jean Bertrand Aristide fled an uprising in February 2004.
Its main troops contributors are: Brazil, Uruguay, Sri Lanka, Jordan, Nepal, Argentina and Chile.
More than half of the Caribbean island's 8.4 million people live on one dollar a day, according to UN officials.
Haiti for generations has suffered through coups, unspeakable poverty and violence. Aid groups in recent months have also reported a rising number of civilian sex assaults against women.

"3423",20043867,"Title: Arrest of top Indian religious leader causes astonishment and outrage.rtf; Date: November 15, 2004 Monday 1:54 AM GMT; Text: It reads like an exotic mystery thriller but it is playing out in real life.
The arrest of India's most revered Hindu leader, accused of masterminding the murder of a former aide, has astonished the country and stirred outrage among his millions of devotees who consider him a divine incarnation.
Ever since the detention Thursday of Jayendra Saraswati, known popularly as the ""Seer of Kanchi"" or the Kanchi Shankaracharya, supporters have been staging protests and hunger strikes in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
""It's as if you had arrested the Pope -- he's the biggest Hindu leader,"" Renuka Narayanan, religion editor of The Indian Express and author of several books on Hinduism, told AFP.
""Holy Seer, Unholy Mess,"" ran a banner headline in a weekend edition of The Hindustan Times over a report detailing allegations against the 71-year-old Saraswati, referred to in India as the ""pontiff"".
Formal charges have not yet been laid against Saraswati and his lawyers have described the accusations as false.
Just last year, political leaders feted Saraswati in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of his nomination as head of the hugely wealthy Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt -- Mutt means spiritual institution -- the leading seat of Hinduism.
Now he is in Vellore Central Prison in the holy town of Kanchipuram, accused of murder, conspiracy and suppressing evidence over the death of his ex-aide and former accountant Thiru Sankararaman, 52.
Media reports say there was a long history of friction between the spiritual leader and the dead man, who resented Saraswati's efforts to turn the Kanchi Mutt from a purely religious establishment into a social institution that helped the needy.
""He was very proactive. He has wanted to change the role of the Hindu pontiff. The previous Shankaracharya was very orthodox,"" said Narayanan. ""The new Shankaracharya was the first person to do 'walkabouts' in the slums.""
Sankararaman had also alleged financial irregularities at the temple. The 2,500-year-old Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt in the temple town controls assets worth over 50 billion rupees (1.14 billion dollars), newspaper reports say.
Media reports say Sankararaman wrote to a Tamil daily on August 30, vowing to remove Saraswati from the leadership of the Kanchi Mutt and alleging he was misusing his authority.
Four days later Sankararaman was found dead from multiple stab wounds after being attacked by five hitmen in another temple that he managed.
Police say they have records of phone conversations with the attackers as well as banknotes seized from the alleged killers that had been withdrawn by the Kanchi Mutt. Fourteen other people have been arrested in the case.
Prosecutors told the court at a weekend hearing there was ""sufficient evidence"" that Saraswati would flee to Nepal if released on bail.
Nepal's royal family are among his followers and he has often visited the world's only Hindu kingdom.
The prosecution petition opposing bail accused him of committing a ""heinous, calculated, well-designed and gruesome murder through rowdy elements on payment of money.""
Defence lawyers said Saraswati was framed and the phone calls could have been clandestinely made by someone else. His request for bail comes up again Wednesday.

The seven prisoners released overnight included Khil Bahadur Bhandari, who was acting editor of the pro-Maoist newspaper Janadesh (""The People's Command"").
The prisoners had been arrested for their alleged support of the Maoists in November 2001, when Nepal imposed a state of emergency following the collapse of the last ceasefire.
Nepal's top court has ordered police to present another 15 jailed Maoist supporters to examine their cases, court officials said.
The Maoists and government have observed a ceasefire since January 29, but the rebels have demanded the release of their jailed supporters before sitting down to talks.
The Maoists also want army soldiers deployed around the country to return to their barracks ahead of negotiations.
Narayan Singh Pun, the minister for physical planning and works, has been meeting with rebel negotiators Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dina Nath Sharma to draft a memorandum of understanding that would formalize the ceasefire and set the groundwork for talks.
The Maoists' ""people's war"" aimed at toppling the constitutional monarchy and establishing a communist republic has claimed 7,800 lives since 1996.
Also Wednesday the pro-Maoist All Nepal National Free Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU-R) held a public meeting in Kathmandu to commemorate Maoist activists killed by the security forces.
The meeting, attended by more than a thousand supporters, honoured 16 rebels killed ""in action"".
Members of their families were offered shawls as a mark of respect.
Prior to the ceasefire the meeting would have been banned and the union leaders would have been arrested if they had appeared in public.
Leader Baikuntha Pokharel, who was in hiding until the ceasefire announcement, charged the security forces with continuing to arrest and torture Maoists despite the truce.
""The government is re-arresting Maoist activists even after releasing them from prison while it has started spying on those who have been released,"" he added.

'The first phase talks will start Tuesday to generate goodwill on both sides,' Narayan Singh Pun, who is also minister of physical planning and works, told a public function at Pokhara in west Nepal.
It is not known where the talks will be held, although media reports have said underground rebel leader Baburam Bhattarai arrived in the capital Kathmandu on Friday.
Bhattarai is the convener of the rebels' talks team comprising top leaders of the outlawed Nepal Communist Party (Maoist).
On Jan. 29, the government reached a ceasefire with the rebels after they agreed to return to the negotiating table.
The rebels had announced what they said as a talks team comprising top leaders to negotiate from their side.
Though both sides signed codes of conduct to follow during the talks on March 13, the talks itself have yet to get under way.
At one stage the rebels charged that the government is not serious about creating an atmosphere conducive for the peace talks.
The rebels pushed forward their demand that their jailed workers should be set free, before any meaningful talks could start.
Fighting for an absolute communist state for Nepal, the rebels say their long-term aim is to 'empower' the people and that they want to write a new constitution for the Himalayan kingdom.
For the present, they want a roundtable conference, an interim government and election for a constituent assembly that would finally draw up the new constitution.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to abolish the constitutional monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal.
The armed rebellion has claimed the lives of more than 7,200 Nepalese on the government count. The unofficial count puts the toll at 10,000.

"6561",20082116,"Title: POLITICS NEPAL BREAKTHROUGH TWO LAST KATHMANDU.rtf; Date: June 25, 2008 Wednesday 5:58 PM  EST; Text: Kathmandu, June 25 -- NC, CPN-ML and NSP (A), during yesterday's SPA meeting, stood in favour of a place for opposition leaders on the NSC while People's Front Nepal and Nepal Workers Peasants Party (NWPP) put forth slightly different views. PFN called for continuity of the consensus culture and NWPP wanted the presence of all the political parties on the security council.
Maoists and the UML have already opposed the concept. The parties gave their final nod to the concept of electing and ousting the prime minister through a simple majority in the CA after their parleys failed to reach a consensus over power-sharing.
They agreed to elect president and vice president through at least 50 per cent plus one vote and oust them through impeachment by at least two-thirds of the members.
In the constitutional amendment, they also agreed to incorporate a provision for representation of the main opposition leader on the Constitutional Council, a body that makes recommendations for appointments to all major positions on behalf of the state.
The parties have agreed to scrap the appendix that mentions the names of the Interim Parliament members and the names of the ruling SPA in many places in the constitution.
The governments will form a special committee for the integration and rehabilitation of Maoist combatants and management of their arms within six months. The committee will comprise major parties in the Constituent Assembly. The parties also agreed to request the UN to limit the role of UNMIN to two specific issues-management of weapons and integration of the combatants.
They have agreed to integrate the combatants after fulfilling the established standards of the security agencies concerned where the combatants are to be integrated.
Besides the issues of constitutional amendment, the parties also agreed to enforce the clauses of past pacts and agreements on peace. For that, the Maoists agreed to transform the paramilitary and barracks structure of their youth wing, Young Communist League, into a purely political body and ensure that YCL cadres vacate government buildings and other public places where they have been sheltering by force, within 15 days.
The Maoists also agreed that they will return all public and private properties captured during the insurgency and in its aftermath, within 15 days. They have agreed to take legal action against those disobeying this agreement.
The parties, however, could not finalise the names of 26 CA members who are to be nominated by the cabinet. They agreed to finalise this after consulting with the parties outside the CA today morning, Dr Minendra Rijal, a Nepali Congress leader said.
The parties, however, did not discuss power-sharing among the parties, as had been expected. ''The PM will speak tomorrow about his willingness to step down but will tender a formal resignation once the president is elected,'' Maoist leader Gurung said.
''I have sensed this from the NC leaders' statements,'' he added. Yesterday's meeting took place two days after the Maoists declared an end of their meetings with the NC after their difference could not be settled.
Earlier in the morning, the Maoists' secretariat meeting had decided to demonstrate maximum flexibility on its stance as the price for maintaining seven-party unity.
''We decided to table an amendment proposal but adopted maximum flexibility for the sake of SPA unity,'' Maoist spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara said.

"6057",20072930,"Title: Nepal Maoists threaten to pull out of government.rtf; Date: July 23, 2007 Monday 6:28 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's former rebels threatened Monday to pull out of a coalition government after a row over a security detail given to their leaders.
""We have sensed a conspiracy against us,"" said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman and minister for communications.
""Of all the 22 ministers only we were given security guards from the ranger battalion, who received jungle warfare training during the insurgency,"" Mahara told journalists at a press conference in Nepal's capital Monday.
The Maoists, who left the jungles and hills to enter Nepal's corridors of power after signing a peace deal earlier this year, have been given five ministerial positions in an interim government.
They continue to face accusations that their activists use mafia-like tactics, and the group remains on a US list of terrorist organisations.
While the state was battling the Maoists, Nepal's 90,000-strong army received training and equipment from countries including India, the US and Britain.
The Maoists believe that they have been given guards from an elite ranger unit, which received US training.
""There was no need to send army with sophisticated weapons for our security,"" said Mahara.
""This move is very suspicious and we were not consulted. We are now seriously considering whether to stay in the government or not,"" Mahara told journalists.
The army, formerly headed by Nepal's sidelined King Gyanendra, denied Maoist charges that they had allocated different security details to the former rebels.
""They are not from a ranger battalion. It was a regular process of transferring security for VIPS,"" army spokesman Ramindra Chhetri said in a statement.
The Maoists launched their ""People's War"" in western Nepal in 1996, aimed at toppling the monarchy and establishing a communist republic.
Last April they joined forces with political parties who had been kicked out of government when the king took direct control of the country in 2005.
After three weeks of mass protests, the king handed back power to the political parties and has since been stripped of most of his powers, including his role as head of state and army chief.
The former rebels now say that they will abide by a political system, and will accept the results of a crucial election to rewrite Nepal's constitution planned for November.
At least 13,000 people were killed during the decade-long civil war.

The government announced on Thursday that it was giving the rebels 50 days to come to the peace table adding they would miss their last chance to discuss their demands for ending their long-running insurgency.
The government has also warned that if the rebels fail to show up, the government will go ahead with parliamentary elections without addressing their demands.
But rebel leader Prachanda said in a statement that the only way out was peace talks in the presence of international mediators and an independent election for a special assembly that would draft a new constitution.
The government has repeatedly refused third party involvement like the United Nations in the peace talks saying it is not an international conflict and should be resolved internally.
Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said the deadline set by the government was seen as a threaten and reduced chances of a peaceful resolution.
Among other things, the rebels have demanded the election of a special assembly to draft a new constitution and decide if the country should be changed from a monarchy to a communist state.
The rebels have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Fighting between the rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and government forces has escalated since the guerrillas withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last year.

Kathmandu, 14 April: The Private and Boarding Schools Organization (Pabson) and the National Private and Boarding Schools Association (N-Pabsan) have stated that no private school in the country can open until loktantra [democracy] is established.
At a program organized at the Reporters' Club on 13 April, Pabson and N-Pabsan appealed to all teachers, staff and students of private schools and the guardians to join the [ongoing opposition] movement.
A joint communique issued by the two organizations and distributed at the program says that the situation that has arisen because of autocracy will have a negative effect on the educational sector. ""The educational sector will prosper only under a loktantra [democratic] system of governance that guarantees social justice"", the communique says.
At the program, Pabson Chairman Umesh Shrestha and N-Pabsan General Secretary Karna Bahadur Shahi said the popular movement is needed for the sake of lasting peace.

Pandit, a junior technical assistant at the Agriculture Development Office, was abducted from his home.
According to Inspector Basudev Khatiwada at the area police office, the kidnappers could have fled the scene after a team of plain clothes policemen and Armed Forced Police intensified their search at the Northern Kataha jungle of Siraha.
Chief of Siraha police, Bikash Shrestha said Pandit told them he was abducted by 24 people from his home but when they reached the jungle there were only four left. He said he was fed rice and instant noodles that night and then tied to a tree.
The next night, only two of the abductors, who were carrying a small size pistol, remained. Pandit told the police that two of the kidnappers had kept him in a jungle and he got a chance to escape at night when one of them went out to fetch water. He hid in the nearby village of Majhalau for the night and informed the police at Bhichairya in the morning.
Pandit, in his statement, has said that Indian criminal groups, particularly those from Jayanagar, might be involved in his kidnapping as they mostly spoke Hindi and Maithali. Shrestha said an Indian national along with a motorcycle have been arrested in connection with the abduction.
Meanwhile, the in-laws of the arrested Indian national have fled their homes in Fulwariya, lending credence to the suspicion about his involvement in the kidnapping.
The abductors had called Pandit's family on Friday from an Indian mobile number demanding Rs 2 million as ransom, said the police. When the news of the ransom reached the police, they intensified the search by including 20 police personnel from Rajbiraj.
A team lead by Inspector Khatiwada is still searching for the kidnappers, according to the police. Since the call for ransom came from an Indian number, a team of Indian police has also been deployed, said Shrestha. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

 Text of report by report by Ram KC, published by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 27 August
 Sindhupalchok [central Nepal]: Nineteen people have been displaced after Maoist intimidation. They left their homes after the Maoists locked up their houses accusing that they failed to make their sons quit their jobs in the security forces.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 27 Aug 05, p 1
The displaced people who came to the district headquarters range from one and half-year-old children to elderly people of 75 years of age. The people were displaced from Pangtan village in the northern part of Sindhupalchok district.
 The Maoists had issued a warning notice on 22 July, ordering the villagers to recall their sons from service in the police. The rebels locked up their houses as they could not make their sons quit their jobs in the security forces as demanded by the rebels.
 Since their houses were locked up, they had been living in make-shift huts in front of their houses. They were forcibly evicted from their huts on 25 August and were forced to come to district headquarters, the victims said.
 ""After we were forced out of our homes, we had to live on the food given by our neighbours,"" said 73-year-old Ichha Ram Adhikari who fled along with five family members. Krishna Prasad Adhikari had to flee along with nine family members, including his one and half-year-old daughter.

Text of report by Nepalese radio HBC 94 FM on 30 April
The president of the Nepal University Teachers' Association, Bhupati Dhakal, says that although the constituent assembly was one of the main issues of the people's movement, political leaders must look beyond agreeing to an election for the assembly. 
Speaking at an interaction programme in the capital today, Dhakal said his association would continue its movement unless and until a date is fixed to hold elections to a constituent assembly. He said merely agreeing to discuss the constituent assembly in parliament would not be enough for the university teachers.
On the issue of the Maoists, he said the weapons of the Maoists was a concern for the Nepalese people and the government because there was no concrete documentation and account of the number of weapons the Maoists possessed. He said there were no credible accounts of the strength of the Maoist militias or the type and number of weapons they had. He said the leaders in parliament now had the challenging task of disarming the Maoists and keeping a record of the weapons handed over by the Maoists.
In response to a question on election to a constituent assembly, Dhakal said the election would be meaningless unless and until the Maoists agreed to lay down their arms and the government totally disarmed the Maoists before holding elections. 
Against this background, Dhakal also said, it is now the responsibility of the seven-party alliance and its leadership to convince the Maoists to put an end to their politics of violence so that the democratic process can move forward. 
He also said elections to a constituent assembly would not be free and fair so long as the Maoists were in control of their weapons.

But we have taken all possible precautions in all fields to defend every inch of our country,"" he said.
 Mr Kasuri said Islamabad would ""not compete with India in the form of a military race, but we will do all that it takes to maintain a minimum credible deterrent"".
 Mr Kasuri was in Dhaka to extend a formal invitation to the Bangladeshi prime minister for a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to be held in Islamabad. He held official talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart Morshed Khan and also met Finance Minister Saifur Rahman.

"120",20032644,"Title: Mexico replaces Jorge Castaneda as foreign secretary; economy secretary to take his post.rtf; Date: January 10, 2003, Friday, BC cycle; Text: President Vicente Fox on Friday accepted the resignation of Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda, who acknowledged his failure to open Mexico's borders with the United States. Fox named the economy secretary to replace him.
In making the first Cabinet shuffle of his 2-year-old presidency, Fox credited his close friend and ally with increasing a once-reclusive Mexico's stature abroad and thanked him for his ""commitment, loyalty and professionalism.""
""In this new stage we begin today, we are committed to making Mexico a bridge between regions and visions of the world,"" Fox said. ""We will consolidate foreign policy as an instrument of Mexico's active presence in the world.""
Fox appointed Economy Secretary Ernesto Derbez as the new foreign secretary, and named Fernando Canales, governor of northern Nuevo Leon state, to take Derbez's post.
Castaneda, a leftist academic who initially seemed an unlikely ally for the conservative Fox, grew to become one of the president's closest advisers and was his most controversial Cabinet member.
Castaneda was credited with increasing Mexico's stature abroad, while irking Mexican lawmakers and some traditional allies, including Cuba.
But as Castaneda acknowledged Friday, he was unable to achieve his greatest goal: striking a migration accord with the United States. Talks which once seemed promising were thwarted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
""I am disappointed that we haven't been able to achieve faster and more concrete results in migration,"" Castaneda said. ""I assume the responsibility of not having reached these goals.""
Castaneda, who appeared with Fox and Derbez at a closed afternoon ceremony, said he would return to academia in the political science department of Mexico's National Autonomous University.
""I will continue fighting from civil society"" for the changes the Fox administration achieved during his two years in the post, he said. ""One has to know when to enter the political arena and when to leave it.""
Derbez said he would continue the push to make Mexico a major international player.
""We have to position our country as a leader in the new international architecture,"" he said.
Derbez, 55, holds a doctorate in economics from Iowa State University and has taught at Johns Hopkins University and the Monterrey Technological Institute.
He spent 15 years with the World Bank, serving as a program officer in Chile, as operations manager in Africa and as director of banking and finance in India, Nepal and Bhutan. While officially still on the staff of the bank, he took a leave of absence in 1997 to work as Fox's economic coordinator during the campaign.
Late Friday, Canales accepted Fox's offer to become economy minister and presented a letter to the Nuevo Leon legislature announcing he was stepping down as the state's governor.
Canales, a member of Fox's conservative National Action Party, has been a big supporter of the president and made Nuevo Leon the first Mexican state to launch one of Fox's pet projects: energy ventures involving public and private funds.
Canales is credited with cleaning up corruption, cracking down on drug trafficking and improving the economy. Last year, Fox dubbed Nuevo Leon a model for developing countries to follow and picked its capital to host a U.N. summit of world leaders.

"7064",2008229,"Title: 1st CPN-M poll mass meeting held in Nepali capital.rtf; Date: February 14, 2008 Thursday 1:18 AM EST; Text: The Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist) (CPN-M) Wednesday issued a strong worded warning that it  would be forced to join a decisive movement if there were attempts to disrupt the upcoming elections thereby preventing it from  rising to power through popular ballot, local newspaper The Rising Nepal reported Thursday.
    Addressing the first Constituent Assembly (CA) election mass  meeting and the 13th anniversary of the People's War organized at  the Open Air Theater in Nepali capital Kathmandu, CPN-M leaders  including party Chairman Prachanda claimed that the party would  secure majority in the upcoming election and vowed to  institutionalize the agendas of nationality, federal democratic  republic, progressive restructuring of the state and people's  livelihood as envisioned by the People's War.
    The party started the People's War on Feb. 13, 1996 and had  gone underground after a 40-point memorandum submitted a month  earlier by its public organization Joint Left Front to the then  Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was ignored.
    ""Seeing our massively growing popularity among the people and  fearing that our party is nearing to acquire state power through  the CA poll legally all the national and international reactionary elements are making their last ditch effort to disrupt the  election,"" claimed Chairman Prachanda.
    He said that the country was availed of a historic opportunity  of developing Nepal into a great nation but the traditional forces that were enjoying the power and exploiting the people were  plotting for a final assault to maintain their position and turn  the clock back. ""We are doing our utmost to stop them while they  are hell bent to stop us,"" he said.
    He asserted that the victory of his party in the poll and birth of new Nepal ensuring liberation of all the oppressed classes was  inevitable as it had a mother-child relation with the same. 
    ""But the nation is passing through some form of terror in that  there are forces bent on keeping the world under their control and are suggesting to derail the poll. They seem to be siding with the army officials who have been demanding for their deployment in the polls and the king is giving untoward expression and armed groups  and activities in Madhesh are mushrooming,"" he said
    Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, senior leader of CPN-M said that the  party's election manifesto would be made public soon. The basis of the commitment would be establishing peace based on drastic  changes.
    ""We will have five point commitment that include  institutionalizing democratic republic, restructuring the state  under a federal structure, pro-people economic policy and national sovereignty,"" Bhattarai said.
    Urging the people to vote for the party he claimed that the  party would gain the state power through the election and his  party chairman would be the first president of the republic in  Nepal.
    He stated that the party had not given up the dream it had at  the time of starting the war, but ""the method is peaceful one now. ""
    Barsh Man Pun, with party name ""Ananta"", deputy commander of  CPN-M armed force, urged the people to expose and foil the  conspiracy of defeating the party by the use of money, muscle,  media and illusion of the middle class.
    Referring to the King's expression that there was meaning in  his keeping mum he warned that there was also meaning in the  silence of the CPN-M army and all the working people.
    Jayapuri Gharti, Chairperson of CPN-M affiliated All Nepal  Women Association (Revolutionary) informed that the party had  decided to send 40 percent women contestants to the polls and  challenged other parties to do so.
    Tilak Pariyar, Chairman of Nepal Dalit Liberation Front United, said that the end of monarchy would herald the beginning of  liberation of the Dalits (people belonging to lower caste).
    In November 2006, the Comprehensive Peace Accord was signed  between CPN-M and the then ruling Seven-party Alliance government. In accordance to the Accord, CPN-M joined the Interim Parliament  on Jan. 15, 2007 and the Interim Government on April 1 last year.
    The CA elections are slated on April 10, and the CA is to  decide the future political set-up of Nepal and the fate of  monarchy.

"3950",20054104,"Title: U.N. seeks record US$4.7 billion for humanitarian crises in 2006.rtf; Date: November 30, 2005 Wednesday; Text: The United Nations appealed Wednesday for a record US$4.7 billion ([euro]4 billion) to ease major humanitarian crises around the world in 2006, with about a third slated for Sudan and the conflict in its Darfur region.
The appeal, which covers 31 million people mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia, is worth the equivalent of 48 hours of worldwide military spending or the cost of two cups of coffee for the planet's 1 billion richest people, the U.N. said.
""In a world of plenty, continued suffering is a terrible stain on our conscience,"" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. ""It is inexcusable that we not strive, with every resource at our disposal, to eliminate suffering.""
The U.N. has never asked for so much money in its initial appeal to start the year. In the past, the U.N. traditionally split away major disasters and crises for their own fundraising.
In addition, improved stability in Congo has made much of the country more accessible, raising the amount needed to about US$1.17 billion, while relief officials now have a better idea of what's needed and where, U.N. humanitarian relief coordinator Jan Egeland said.
Countries covered include a host of African nations that have long been in crisis, including Chad, Congo, Liberia, Somalia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Also on the list are Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya, the Palestinian territories, Colombia and Nepal.
The US$1.5 billion ([euro]1.3 billion) sought for Sudan reflects the grave nature of the problem in Darfur, where humanitarian work is threatened by continued clashes between government-backed Arab militias and rebel groups, Egeland said.
""It's not going well in Darfur at all,"" Egeland said. ""We are stretched to the limit. We're hanging in there by our fingernails.""
Donors around the world met just 57 percent of last year's worldwide appeal, which started out at US$1.7 billion and focused on forgotten crises. By the end of the year, after the South Asian tsunami and other disasters, appeals ended up reaching US$5.9 billion, and the U.N. said some US$766 million hasn't been pledged or donated.
A chronic problem is that 90 percent of aid comes from just 10 nations, including the United States, Japan and several Scandinavian nations. Middle East and Persian Gulf states continue to eschew the appeals, Egeland said.
""We expect the oil-rich countries to give more to us than they are giving now on average,"" Egeland said.
This year's humanitarian appeal would cover work by 18 U.N. agencies and 113 non-governmental organizations operating around the world. He said that if other disasters arise as they did in 2005, the appeal could top US$6 billion for the first time by the end of the year.

 Parbat west Nepal , 7 November: Due to fear of kidnapping by the Maoists, middle school and high school students in villages in the south-central part of the district have started fleeing. This has affected teaching and learning in almost a dozen schools.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Nov 04, p5
The students started fleeing from late September. Some of them had returned for the Dashain festival but they left again after the festival. The parents sent their children away after the Maoists intensified abductions after mid-September. They said that the Maoists threatened that they could take their children away at any time. ""Fearing kidnapping, I was compelled to send them away,"" said a guardian. The villagers said that the children were sent to their relatives' or to different urban areas such as the district headquarters, Pokhara, Kathmandu, Chitwan, Butwal and Bhairahawa.
 According to a teacher, student attendance dropped since mid-September. The schools opened after the Dashain festival but teaching-learning activity has come to a halt. At least 50 per cent of the students have fled, he said. Those who still come to school run away when the Maoists are around.
 The local people are terrorised after Maoists abducted three dozen school children. The parents say that they will send their children to school once the situation returns to normal. The parents have demanded that the relevant authorities create a fearless environment to send their children to school.

Maoists are planning to declare altogether 13 autonomous states in the country by December 18.The region to be declared today are Newa Autonomous State in Kathmandu valley and Tamsaling Autonomous State in Dhading, Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts bordering the capital.Abolish the president's unconstitutional move, maintain civilian supremacy, safeguard national independence and stop foreign interference are the main slogans written in a placard at the venue of declaring Newa Autonomous region.Nepali Congress and CPN-UML have been criticising the Maoists for their drive to declare various autonomous states saying that it will derail the peace process and obstruct the process of drafting the constitution.The Tharu and Limbuwan ethnic groups have issued separate statements denouncing the Maoists' move to declare autonomous states unilaterally.Nepali Congress Parliamentary Party leader Ramchandra Poudyal said that the party denounces the Maoists' declaration of autonomous states one after another as such move could bring about anarchy and confrontation and push the country into violent conflict.""It's an extremely contradictory, irresponsible and risky move of the Maoists,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Maoists have intensified drive to capture private land in the name of distributing to the poor people.

"1445",20044306,"Title: Nepal PM invites Maoist rebels for new talks on bloody insurgency.rtf; Date: September 22, 2004 Wednesday 3:44 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday invited Maoist rebels to resume negotiations that broke down over a year ago but said he would only offer a key concession if the guerrillas agreed to talk.
Deuba said his government's peace committee ""has formally invited the Maoists to come to the negotiating table for peace talks.""
He offered no details on when and where the talks would take place. He said the negotiations would be closed, amid criticism the last peace bid collapsed in August 2003 in part because of the intense media attention around meetings.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy in an insurgency that has claimed 10,000 lives.
The rebels, who enjoy free rein in much of the countryside, have demanded the government stop labelling them a terrorist group, which keeps their leaders away from cities for fear of arrest.
But Deuba said: ""The terrorist tag labelled against the rebels will be withdrawn only when they come to the negotiating table.""
A three-member delegation headed by Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a human rights activist with contacts with the Maoists, left Wednesday for the southwestern town of Nepalgunj to deliver the invitation to the Maoists, who control areas near the Indian border city.
""We are trying... to arrange for peace talks at an earliest date to end the present political and security problem in Nepal,"" Tuladhar told AFP before his departure.
A top Maoist leader, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, recently told a local newspaper that the rebels were ready to talk to the government if it stopped referring to the guerrillas as terrorists and released Maoists from prison.
The rebels have been building pressure on the government with a two-day strike set for next week during one of the Himalayan kingdom's most important festivals.
The Maoists in August used threats to stop traffic in and out of the capital Kathmandu for one week and to shut down 47 businesses.
The industries reopened a month later when the government released two prominent rebels from jail.

King Gyanendra was due to address the nation at 11:30 pm (1745 GMT) a day before the opposition vowed to stage a huge rally in the capital Kathmandu demanding a return to multi-party democracy.
The announcement came amid a swirl of speculation that the king would recall Nepal's parliament to try to end the daily protests that have left at least 14 people dead since April 6.
King Gyanendra took control after sacking the government in February last year saying it was corrupt and had failed to tackle a bloody 10-year Maoist insurgency.
The parliament was dissolved in May 2002 as it appeared set to refuse to prolong a six-month state of emergency that gave the king sweeping powers to tackle the Maoist insurgency.
Maoists started their campaign in 1996 and have taken effective control of swathes of the countryside in a campaign that has left more than 12,500 people dead.
The king has announced a series of curfews to try to quell the protests organised by an alliance of seven parties sidelined by the king's power grab in 2005.
Thousands of people have gathered daily on the edge of the curfew zone marked by Kathmandu's ring road where they have set up road blocks and clashed with security forces.
A general strike has left the capital low on fuel and food with hospitals complaining of shortages of medical equipment. Rubbish has piled up on the sides of the street.

"7171",2008378,"Title: Nepal Police to lodge three cases Indian kidney racket kingpin Dr. Kumar.rtf; Date: February 8, 2008 Friday 1:09 PM  EST; Text: Kathmandu, Feb. 8 -- Nepal Police has said that it will lodge three cases against Indian kidney racket kingpin Dr Amit Kumar Rawat, who was arrested in Chitwan on Thursday evening.
  Dr Amit was presented before the public at Metropolitan High Commissioner Office at Ranipokhari here this afternoon.
  Nepal Police sources were quoted by Kantipur as saying that the three cases against Dr. Kumar would be filed on Sunday after carrying out necessary procedures for the filing of charges relating to the transplant of human organs and the Interpol ""Red Corner"" notice. He is accused of having forced or duped around 500 people into donating their kidneys.
  Senior Superintendent of Police Upendra Kant Aryal, who is also the chief of Metropolitan Police Crime Division in Hanumandhoka, said that Nepal Police arrested Kumar along with one of his close aide, Manish Singh, from the Hotel Wildlife Camp at Sauraha near Kathmandu on Thursday evening. A bank draft for Indian rupees 936,000, and Euros 145,000 and USD 18,900 in cash was also seized from the arrested. 
  Dr Amit Kumar had been staying in different luxurious hotels in Nepal since his arrival in the country on January 26. Police said he had fled to Chitwan fearing his arrest after news about him started to spread.
  He had come to Nepal with a project to construct a hospital. According to Police, he was helped by Nepalis- Ramesh Thapa, Bishnu Khatri, Giri dai, Heera Pun, Baburam, Sher Bahadur and Pankaj Jha. 
  Police said they are investigating the arrested Nepalis.
  During a press conference held here on Friday afternoon, Dr. Rawat admitted that he had performed around 300-400 kidney transplants with a team of four doctors.
  He also confirmed plans to shift his kidney organ trade network from India to Nepal with the help of his agent, Pankaj Jha. Three doctors, Amit Kumar, K K Agarwal and Upendra have been arrested while another medico Dr Saras, a resident of New Delhi is still absconding. 
  Kumar revealed that he went from Canada to Nepal on 30th December last year and then, came to India from Nepal to perform five kidney transplants. He left for Nepal on January 25. In Nepal, he stayed at various hotels and finally came to Sauraha hotel on February 6, where he was arrested. 
  Earlier, the Nepali Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ram Kumar Chaudhary disclosed that the operation was a joint effort of the Interpol and the Nepalese police. He informed that a lot of cash has also been recovered from him. ""Euro nine lakh thirty six thousand worth of drafts, USD 1 lakh and forty five thousand along with some Nepali currency has been recovered."" 
  Three mobiles with SIM cards of Canada, Nepal and India have also been recovered from him. Dr Amit said that he had not been using his mobile phones since the last three days and was using STD booths instead to contact his family. His family is in Canada, where he has also shifted a huge portion of his colossal wealth. 
  Meanwhile, four persons, who were allegedly confined at a house of Dr Amit's friend Yashpal, were on Thursday night rescued by the police. 
  Police said the kidneys of the four, Dileep, Sayeed, Naresh and Rajender had been removed. Yashpal is still absconding. 
  The victims were kept confined at a flat in Valley View Estate on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road. Police said one of them had called up the control room, after which law enforcers reached there. 
  Three were labourers from Uttar Pradesh, while Rajender was from Uttarakhand. All of them were around 30 years of age, police said. They were recuperating after their kidneys were removed and the police have taken them to a hospital. 
  Dr. Kumar will be brought to Delhi in the next two to three days, according to sources.

 The government is shocked with the Maoists' decision to close the Kathmandu contact office, but it ""thinks"" such a move will not affect the forthcoming peace talks, government talks-convener Kamal Thapa told Nepalnews late Sunday 20 July evening.
 ""We are 'shocked',"" Communications Minister Thapa said in a telephonic conversation, reacting to the closure of the Maoists' Kathmandu contact office Sunday. ""This incident has come to us as a surprise. We were engaged in preparation for the third round of peace talks,"" Thapa said. He said Maoists' contact office secretary Bharat Dhungana's arrest was made for general inquiry. ""With regard to the increasing 'donation terror' in the nation, some arrested ones reported the involvement of Bharat Dhungana in that,"" Minister Thapa said. ""Following such reports, police took him for general interrogation."" ""There was no any reason and circumstance to close the office. I still urge the Maoists to open their contact office…  ellipsis as published . I urge them not to go for minor things and hold talks as soon as possible."" He said, ""we are ready to address confusion and grievances of Maoists and to confess, if we are wrong.""
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 20 Jul 03
On the question of not providing security to Maoist talks negotiators, Minister Thapa stated the government has fully guaranteed their security. ""It is baseless to blame us that we did not provide security to them. Even if the talks fail, we will give them 'safe passage' (unto their destination)."" When asked whether the office closure will affect the forthcoming talks, he said, ""In my opinion, the incident will not affect the talks."" He, however, did not say whether the incident would break the nine-month-old cease-fire.
 Meanwhile, the Maoist ""high command"" has been reported to have engaged in formulating ""party strategy"" in a highly secured Maoist-area.

"6735",2008489,"Title: Running cross-country.rtf; Date: May 7, 2008 Wednesday 3:38 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, May 7 -- With the historic win of the Maoists in Nepal, relations with India predictably figure high on the agenda of the new government in Kathmandu. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, a.k.a. Prachanda, who will play a key role in the future political dispensation, has already spoken of renegotiating the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
  This treaty made two very overarching arrangements on security issues. New Delhi and Kathmandu undertook to inform each other of any serious friction or misunderstanding with any neighbouring State likely to cause any breach in friendly relations between India and Nepal.
  It also agreed that neither government would tolerate any threat to the security of the other and not to employ any foreigners whose activity may be prejudicial to the other's security. Not all these measures have been to Prachanda's satisfaction.
  The treaty made far-reaching provisions for the reciprocity in movement of people which kept the border regimes open and interactive. Under this, they agreed to grant, on a reciprocal basis, to the nationals of one country in the territories of the other the same privileges in the matter of residence, ownership of property, participation in trade and commerce, movement and other privileges of a similar nature.
  There has been a protracted demand by some sections of the Nepalese elite for the abrogation of the treaty on various grounds. They have used this to demonstrate India's 'big brotherly attitude' and 'attempt to erode and usurp sovereignty'. However, they never mention the huge tangible and intangible benefits that some of the provisions of this treaty have brought Nepal.
  But many of the issues in the treaty have also resulted in bad patches in India-Nepal relations, including the 'equidistance policy' with China and the 'zone of peace' proposal have been associated with this treaty. Despite deep reservations on this sensitive issue, India had agreed in the mid-90s to consider Nepal's demands for a review of this treaty. Nothing much has happened since then.
  Interestingly, the 10 million-odd Indian Gorkhas living in various parts of India have also been demanding the abrogation of the treaty and the closing down of the borders. This is because their identity is being diluted by the floating population from Nepal who come to India for livelihood.
  As a result, Indian Gorkhas are dubbed as foreigners in states like Assam, Manipur and Meghalaya. For this separate Indian identity, they had fought for the recognition of Nepali language in the Indian constitution for four decades. Nepali was included as an official language in 1992.
  Surprisingly, the most vital issue in the treaty imbroglio has been the continuation of the regime of an open border on which the treaty
  is silent. Nowhere in the treaty, or in the 'secret' letter exchanged with the treaty, has the word 'border' or 'open border' or 'border regime' been mentioned
  Why should India draw flak for keeping a dead treaty alive?
  There could be two dynamics in the freshly emerging India-Nepal relations. The first is to continue the 'special relations' and decide on the parameters of new political relations. The second is to have a relation based on open relations, as it is between any two sovereign countries. This could mean a major shift in the bilateral regulatory matrices. India could leave it to Kathmandu to define what kind of relationship it wants with it.
  It is against this backdrop that there are three critical options in determining the future of this treaty. First, let this treaty be drastically rewritten, incorporating likely future needs after which the treaty must be freshly signed. A new framework of bilateral relations that is in tune with present domestic, regional and global developments should be evolved. The most critical aspect that needs to be reassessed is the issue of an open border and the movement of people, goods and services through it.
  Second, this treaty could be abrogated forthwith after a kind of referendum, particularly in Nepal. This referendum is needed to spread the debate about the need to abrogate the treaty and the possible implications of that on the general people.
  At the grassroots, people who make maximum use of the open border and its related benefits possibly do not even know that their ruling elites are raising issues related to the abrogation of the treaty that directly affect their movement across the border. There is a very strong feeling that the scrapping of the treaty is primarily sought by the Nepalese elite who are not sure about its implications.
  Third, this treaty could be abrogated and several new agreements like the modalities of open border, movement of people, recruitment of Nepalese citizens in the Indian Army, management of natural resources, tourism, cross-border environmental cooperation and management of non-traditional security issues could be signed.

"6377",200723,"Title: Roadworks set to take three years on China side of China- Nepal border.rtf; Date: October 30, 2007 Tuesday 9:00 AM EST; Text: A project to seal 180 kilometers of  a major trade route on the China-Nepal border could take up to  three years as workers deal with the difficult terrain in the  region.
    Workers have already sealed the 620-kilometer China side of the Sino-Nepal Highway from Lhasa to Gangga, but the final stretch  between Gangga and Zham looks set to be the most difficult.
    To asphalt the last 180 kilometers will cost 800 million yuan  (about 100 million U.S. dollars) and it will be carried out in two stages, said Wang Riquan, political instructor of the No.2  transport detachment of the Armed Police, who is in charge of the  roadworks.
    The first stage would be Gangga to Nyalam, followed by the  second stage of about 30 kilometers from Nyalam to Zham.
    The improvements to the Nyalam-Zham section, which had been  built into the mountains and bordered a deep ravine, would be  especially difficult, said Wang.
    ""Only single-way traffic is possible on the Nyalam-Zham section, the end of the China section, "" said Wang.
    The mountainous terrain, high altitude and severe weather  conditions that comprised rains in summer and heavy snow and  avalanche risks in winter would all contribute to the difficulties, said Wang.
    The earth and sand highway connecting Lhasa, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, and Katmandu, capital of Nepal, was begun in 1958, and was put into service in 1965.
    Sino-Nepal Highway has a total length of more than 900 km, of  which 800 km are in China and it connects with the National  Highway 318.
    The unsealed roadbed was unable to sustain growing economic  activity and trade between China and Nepal.
    Since the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway last year and  the improved Sino-Nepal highway, trade between China and Nepal has risen rapidly.
    Zham port, the only state-level land port in Tibet for foreign  trade, recorded 42,000 tons of freight for import and export, with a value of 120 million U.S. dollars, in the first half, up 62  percent and 47 percent from the same period last year, according  to the Zham Port administration.
    About 7,000 tourists cross the border at Zham each day.

Twenty-five rebels and two soldiers were killed in the southern Chitwan district in fighting that erupted after the Maoists attacked an army truck, the official said.
Four rebels and three soldiers were killed in two other clashes in southwestern Nepal, the official said.
He said more Maoists could have died when the army attacked by helicopter but the rebels took away the bodies. It was impossible to verify the tolls independently because of the remoteness of the battle sites.
The Maoists have ordered all traffic off the streets and shops closed from Tuesday through Thursday in their latest general strike.
The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist republic since 1996. The uprising has claimed more than 9,500 lives.

"7249",20092153,"Title: Protest erupts in Nepal over naming of Indian priests.rtf; Date: September 5, 2009 Saturday 9:46 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoists burnt tyres and blocked roads in Kathmandu on Saturday in a new protest over a decision to appoint Indian high priests at the country's holiest Hindu temple, police said.
The demonstration by dozens of protesters came as the two priests took up their duties at the sprawling Pashupati temple on the banks of the sacred Bagmati river in the Nepal capital, police said.
Shouting ""Indian priests go home,"" the protesters torched tyres and threw up roadblocks.
Four protesters were detained but later released, police officer Duryodhan Gharti said.
The latest demonstration came after Maoists, wielding iron rods, attacked the Indian priests on Friday as they were performing purification rituals before taking up their new temple posts, police said.
The priests suffered minor injuries in the attack.
Leading priests at UNESCO-listed Pashupati temple have traditionally been high-caste Hindus from southern India, a custom that has gone on for hundreds of years.
But the previous Maoist government sought to scrap the tradition, saying in December it wanted them to come from Nepal instead.
The step was part of wider moves by the Maoist government to restructure Nepal's relationship with its giant neighbour which some Nepalese see as too dominant in the impoverished landlocked nation's affairs.
But the Maoist government had to suspend its decision to appoint Nepalese priests after large protests by junior priests and devotees, leaving the temple without senior priests for many months.
The Maoist government collapsed earlier this year and, with the Hindu festival season approaching, Nepal's new administration decided to appoint new Indian priests.
""The daily temple rituals were being hampered due to the vacant high priest posts,"" temple official Sushil Nihata told AFP.
Nepal's Minister of Culture Minendra Rijal condemned the violence against the Indian priests as ""disrespectful and barbaric"" and promised the ""strongest possible action"" to ensure peaceful religious worship.
In New Delhi, an Indian foreign ministry spokesman called the attack on the priests ""criminal"" and said it went ""against the civilisational ties of friendship.""
The Indian foreign ministry said it was in touch with the government of Nepal to seek to ensure the safety of the priests.

The assembly will rewrite the constitution, decide the future political system and rule the country during an interim period.
Of 601 members in the Constituent Assembly, 240 are chosen by directly elected seats, while 335 are chosen by proportional representation and 26 nominated by the government. The election was held April 10.
Vote-counting directly elected seats was completed earlier in the week. Ex-communist rebels, formally called the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), won 120 of the 240 directly elected seats. The former rebels were also leading in the proportional representation votes.
Election commissioner Usha Nepal said officials finished counting the proportional representation votes Thursday morning and results were likely to be announced in the afternoon.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's Nepali Congress party won 37 seats and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) had 33. The Madeshi People's Rights Forum, which was seeking autonomy and greater rights for people in southern Nepal, had 30 seats.
The Maoists' top leaders have been meeting with different political parties to form a new coalition government.
The April 10 elections were the first since the Maoists gave up a 10-year insurgency in 2006 and joined mainstream politics the following year. More than 13,000 people died in the fighting.
The Maoists, which the United States considers a terrorist organization, surprised many with their strong showing in the elections, tapping into a desire for change and billing themselves as an alternative to the traditional, squabble-laden politics of the country's recent past.

"7365",20113585,"Title: Scions of Maoist brass for retirement package.rtf; Date: November 29, 2011 Tuesday; Text: KATHMANDU, Nov. 29 -- After leading a life of uncertainty and shortages at the cantonments since 2007, personnel of the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) are finally heaving a sigh of relief, with most of them opting for either integration or voluntary retirement.
But a few Maoist fighters are luckier than others. The sons and daughters of top Maoist echelons, who have been registered as combatants but are living a comfortable life with their parents in Kathmandu, have gone back to the cantonments, and will enjoy the same packages.
""It is not that we are enjoying the comforts of city life. We are working with our parents as their staff,"" said Femash Pun, son of PLA chief Nanda Kishor Pun. He is registered as company commander at the Fifth Division in Rolpa.
As per the Agreement on Management of the Monitoring of the Arms and Armies, only certain number combatants could go on leave for a certain period of time only
Others among these lucky combatants are Rahul Mahara and Nirmal Mahara, both sons of standing committee member Krishna Bahadur Mahara, and Prabha Bogati, daughter of Secretary Posta Bahadur Bogati.
The wives of some Maoist leaders who have been staying with their spouses in Kathmandu have also been entitled to the packages. Among them are Laxmi Poudel, wife of Janardan Sharma, and Yogmaya Banjade, who was recently divorced from Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi.
In fact, the party has also formally deployed the wives of Maoist leaders as the latter's staff.
Interestingly, these leaders from the Dahal faction of the party, who have issued a decree to the combatants to opt for integration, have not prevented their own sons and daughters from enjoying the lucrative voluntary retirement packages.
But the sons and daughters deny that the party has issued any formal decree or that they have been advised by their parents to choose voluntary packages.
""It is not that I was advised by my parents to seek voluntary retirement. I have been practicing journalism and still continue in the profession,"" said Prabha, company vice-commander from the Fifth Division at Rolpa. Bogati, 23, works as a reporter for Kathmandu-based Himalayan Television.
Laxmi, wife of Janardan Sharma, argued that she was interested in joining the NA, but added that she was not in sound health. ""My age also doesn't allow me to join the NA,"" says Laxmi, 45, who is a company commander from the Third Division at Shaktikhor.
Similarly, Rahul, son of Krishna Bahadur Mahara, stated that he has opted for voluntary retirement as he wants to build his career in politics, not in the army. ""I am more interested in politics that anything else,"" said Rahul, who is a platoon commander.
Interestingly, Rahul was a protagonist in the Nepali movie Kishan. His elder brother Nirmal is brigade vice-commander in the Fifth Division.
The Maoist establishment faction issued a fiat to PLA personnel to opt for integration to counter the party radical faction that has asked them to choose voluntary retirement.

"6552",2008699,"Title: Indian protesters shave heads in support of Tibetans.rtf; Date: April 7, 2008 Monday 10:33 AM GMT; Text: About 50 people in India's capital, including Sikhs and a three-year-old girl, shaved their heads Monday to protest China's crackdown in Tibet.
""For Sikhs, it is a personal and political decision to grow your hair,"" protester Baljit Malik said. ""Today I am cutting it for political reasons.""
Uncut hair, regarded as a symbol of holiness and strength, is one of five articles of faith prescribed by Sikh tradition.
""Shaving our heads is the strongest non-violent signal we can send to show our solidarity with people in Tibet,"" Youdon Aukatsang, a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, said.
Others at the New Delhi demonstration, which saw hundreds of people from various faiths protesting, donated blood for a local treatment centre ""in honor of killed Tibetans,"" Aukatsang said.
More than 150 Tibetans have been killed in China's crackdown on the protests against its rule of the Himalayan region, according to Tibet's government in exile. Beijing says Tibetan rioters have killed 20 people.
Mass shavings were also part of symbolic protests in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala, where the Tibetan parliament-in-exile is based, and in Nepal's capital Kathmandu.
The Delhi arm of the Tibetan Solidarity Committee organised the event and has planned regular protests in the city leading up to the Olympic torch's arrival on April 17, Aukatsang said.
Tibetan exiles in India -- numbering close to 200,000 -- have threatened to disrupt the torch relay, prompting Indian authorities to step up security for the event.
India has also shortened the route of the relay from nine kilometres (six miles) to just a few kilometres in view of the planned protests.
Monday's event came a day after the Dalai Lama urged Tibetans to refrain from violence in a statement released from his home in Dharamshala.
The demonstration emphasised Indian support for Tibetan protests. Signs declaring ""Long live Indo-Tibetan friendship"" and a picture of Mahatma Gandhi hung over a large tent at Monday's event. 
""All people who want democracy are with Tibet,"" Swami Agnivesh, president of the World Council of Arya Samaj reform movement, said to the crowd. ""Tibet will prevail and it will be a win for all of us.""

""I found him (Bhattarai) very positive on government's decision,"" Khanal said at the Reporters' Club, adding that his party has already initiated contacts with Maoist leaders. Khanal also said the government would soon form a ""small sized"" dialogue team comprising of representatives from all sectors.
Dr Shekhar Koirala, central member of Nepali Congress (NC), too concurred to what Khanal said on the issue of holding dialogue with the Maoists. ""Dialogue with them (Maoists) will be held soon,"" he said without being specific.
Dr Prakash Saran Mahat of NC (Democratic) spoke on arms management of both the army and the Maoists for the smooth conducting of elections to constituent assembly. Dr K.B. Rokaya, a political analyst, said the movement must not end until the government announces dates for unconditional constituent assembly elections and the objectives of the mass movement are fulfilled. Chitra Bahadur KC, leader of Janamorcha Nepal, said the parties must be careful since the autocracy has only ""knelt down, not extinguished"".

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 10 February
Janakpurdham [southeast Nepal], 9 February: Officials of the cooperation agency of the Swiss government have arrived in Janakpur on Friday [9 February]. The visiting Swiss officials met politicians, businessmen, intellectuals, lawyers and journalists in Janakpur and discussed the recent protest movement in the Terai plains.
Those who participated in the meeting said that the human rights situation in the Terai region was poor. The movement had its root in the political game play and discrimination meted out to the people of the Terai region. Country director of the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) Joerg Frieden said he that he came along on the field visit to Janakpur as he was not satisfied with the news reports from the media based in Kathmandu.
During his meeting with journalists, Frieden discussed the difficulties and problems associated with news coverage during the protest. Participating journalists said that they experienced difficulties because the national media portrayed the Terai movement as communal rioting.
Rajesh Kumar Karna, secretary of the Janakpur district chapter of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ), said: ""The journalists had to suffer as the national media disseminated news against the spirit of the movement."" The journalists said that the news from the districts should be accorded priority by the national media so that the journalists could work without difficulty.

 At first glance, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's address to the nation of Wednesday evening 9 June looked like nothing but a formality.
 To see the prime minister now making a ""special commitment"" to economic, social and cultural reforms looked like he was joking, but by calling for negotiations and agreement with all sides he has tried to make the country hopeful.
 At this point, the prime minister cannot be judged by his commitments on paper, neither will those commitments be able to address the nation's problems. The first challenge for the prime minister is to form an all-party government. His actions, efficiency and flexibility in this purpose will be the true yardstick by which to judge him.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 11 Jun 04
Now the political parties also do not have many options left. Aimless objection or revenge doesn't bode well for the nation. Deuba's political capabilities and past might not be undisputed, but for reviving the constitutional process, there is no alternative to assisting him. It wouldn't be logical or practical to choose an endless and radical path in the name of correcting regression. To free the nation from crises the political parties should not give room to aimless anarchy. This is an opportunity to fight for democracy while being in power. The parties should exploit this.
 The prime minister, keeping in view past experiences, has appealed to the Maoists to be ready for peace talks. The prime minister's commitment to search for a peaceful solution to the problem in itself is a positive message. It is not that the political parties are unaware of the fact that general elections and full activation of the constitution are not possible without solving the Maoist problem. But constructive negotiation and a solution to the problem are not possible just through wholesale appeal and abstract request.
 For fruitful talks with the Maoists, direct participation of the political parties in the negotiation process is inevitable.
 Certainly the prime minister has worn a crown of thorns. But this is not his personal challenge. Deuba's failure will not be his personal failure but the failure of the possibility of restoring the constitutional process. Besides all these weaknesses, Deuba now is the representative of democratic possibility. To seek a solution to the Maoist problem and to ensure that the constitution is activated, his hands must be made strong now. The political parties should choose between retaliatory anarchy and political efficiency. With Deuba they are also participants in this historic test.

    The 65-year-old, who was a member of the Nepali Congress (NC)  party that had led several pro-democracy protests in Nepal, had  been admitted to the Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu Wednesday  after her condition deteriorated and died in early morning on  Friday, the hospital told the media. 
    Acharya, the niece of Nepal's first elected prime minister B.P.  Koirala and of the NC president G.P. Koirala, was plunged into  politics headfirst in 1961 when she, along with two other  students, showed black flags when the then king Mahendra and was  jailed for three and a half years. 
    Acharya won elections from her home constituency Morang in 1991  in eastern Nepal and began her ascent to power as agriculture  minister. 
    Later, she became water resources minister as well as deputy  prime minister in 1997. 
    She was the only woman politician in Nepal to have risen so  far. 
    However, Acharya's bid to become president of her party failed  and she was sidelined by the party.

Information Minister Karenga Ramadhani said the peacekeepers had achieved their goal of helping to integrate former government and rebel forces into the new national army in the small central African nation.
Burundi, which suffered a 12-year civil war, also successfully held a series of elections from February to August, Ramadhani noted.
More than 250,000 people, mainly civilians, were killed in the war that erupted in 1993 after paratroopers from the Tutsi ethnic minority assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected president from the Hutu ethnic majority.
The U.N. sent thousands of peacekeepers in June 2004 to help stabilize the country and oversee a restoration of democracy.
With that accomplished, the U.N. resolved to send home 40 percent of about 6,500 troops by the end of April, military spokesman Maj. Momar Diagne said.
The Mozambican troops were the first to leave, marching Saturday from a U.N. military camp to the nearby airport, where U.N. Deputy Force Commander Brig. Gen. Boucedha Boucedha said farewell.
""You came in Burundi to help establish peace,"" Boucedha told the troops on the tarmac. ""This peace is now established. The government of Burundi has been elected democratically; your mission is over.""
The 817-strong Kenyan contingent is the next to leave in February, followed by Ethiopians, Jordanians, Pakistanis, South Africans and lastly Nepalese, according to the withdrawal plan.

U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said peacekeepers who monitor a demilitarized zone set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War between Iraq and Kuwait reported ""numerous violations,"" since Tuesday ""by personnel in civilian clothes in 4 x 4 vehicles, at least some of whom were armed and identified themselves as U.S. Marines.""
Marine Maj. David Andersen, a public affairs officer for the U.S.-led coalition command center in Kuwait City, said the Marines were investigating the report.
Col. Youssef al-Mullah, spokesman for Kuwait's Defense Ministry, told The Associated Press: ""This is Kuwaiti land, and if we deem that any changes should be done to the fence in the interest of defending the country, we will do them.""
Eckhard said peacekeepers observed three breaches that had been cut in an electric fence that Kuwait erected after a U.S.-led coalition forced Iraqi troops out of the country in 1991. The peacekeepers didn't see the Marines cut the fence but believe the Marines did so.
In one incident on Tuesday, observers saw four men in a car near the fence, said Daljeet Bagga, a spokesman for the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM).
The men identified themselves as U.S. Marines who were cleared by Kuwaiti authorities to be in the area, Bagga said.
The men told observers they were testing radio equipment, Bagga said. They were not seen working on the fence, he added. A gap was found in the fence near the site later in the day, though Bagga said he could not confirm the Marines were responsible.
He said, however, that Kuwait has been making extra openings in the fence. In the last two days, workers from Nepal and India have made seven new gaps and have been installing gates on them.
The 120-mile fence already had 19 gated openings.
""We have not seen anyone in uniform,"" at the sites of the new openings, Bagga said.
He said UNIKOM has reported the seven new gaps to the United Nations and asked the Kuwaiti government for an explanation.
""We are concerned about this,"" he said ""We were not informed about it.""
Kuwaiti officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
Eckhard said the complaint was sent to the Security Council in the form of a letter from the U.N. peacekeeping department. Eckhard said the breach may violate the Security Council resolution that set up the zone but that it was up for the council to make that determination.
The United States has amassed more than 300,000 troops in the region in preparation for another possible war with Iraq. In the meantime, it is pushing council members to adopt a new resolution that would authorize military force, as it did in 1991.

Kathmandu, March 10
A gunman today shot at Yunus Ansari, who has been doing time in the Central Jail on charge of operating a fake Indian currency racket.
The shooting in one of the most tightly guarded prisons took place after the hitman, identified as Jasjeet Singh alias Vijay from 47-Sarojani Nagar, Lucknow, dodged two layers of security check to reach the visitors' room.
""He entered the visitors' room on the pretext of visiting Charles Sobhraj Gurumukh and opened fire on Ansari at point-blank range with a UK-made revolver at around 11:30 am,"" said Metropolitan Police Commissioner AIG Arjun Jung Shahi. Ansari, son of former minister Saleem Miya Ansari, was talking to his elder brother Amin and sister-in-law at that time and Sobhraj was yet to arrive.
According to Shahi, the hitman was a notorious contract killer who had shot two people dead and wounded three others in the past in his hometown. According to an eyewitness, the revolver didn't work when the shooter made his first attempt on Ansari's life, and when he tried again, Constable Pramod Kumar Chaurasiya stepped in, forcing the shooter to go off target and hit Ansari in the shoulder.
Police immediately cornered Singh and detained him with the revolver and five rounds of live bullets. Ansari was taken to Norvic hospital for treatment. Dr Rajendra Regmi said Ansari was out of danger.
AIG Shahi said two of Singh's accomplices, Ramu Dwibedi (35) and Suresh Dwibedi (30), were at large. ""Preliminary investigation suggests that a man by name of Ali Adhakshya on February 1 had telephoned the Dwibedi duo to find a contract killer. The contract was settled for INR 1.5 million. They met Singh and gave him INR 750,000 as advance,"" said AIG Shahi. MPCO has announced a cash prize of Rs 50,000 for providing information leading to arrest of the Dwibedi duo.
Dwibedis had received Singh in Kalanki on February 5 and sheltered him in the house of Narayan Pandey. Singh changed his abode after 21 days and was living at the house of Chandra Maya Khadka in Bode, Bhaktapur. Singh had drawn out a meticulous plan: He would visit the jail to meet Sobhraj and Amar Tondon regularly to find out the timing of Ansari visiting his relatives. He was never seen talking to Ansari.
Investigating officials said they were probing whether Sobhraj and other jailbirds were involved in the crime. Ansari's father Saleem Miya said the incident was orchestrated by the police and jail administration.
Questions galore, answers none
KATHMANDU: Questions are being raised whether the criminal racket that murdered media baron Jamim Shah was involved in Ansari shooting as well. A panel formed to probe Jamim's murder had reported that the same criminals had targeted Jamim after their plan to kill Ansari could not be executed four times due to various reasons. Ansari was already in police custody when Jamim was shot dead in broad daylight in Kathmandu on February 7 last year.
Police admit negligence 
KATHMANDU: AIG Arjun Jung Shahi attributed the incident to 'security negligence' but rubbished 'security lapse' allegations. ""We have found security negligence on our part,"" said Shahi. ""ASI Laxman Bhandari and policemen Manoj Kumar Karki and Tilak Ram Chaudhary tasked with carrying out security check on the visitors have been suspended."" However, no action was initiated against jail security in-charge DSP Pushkar KC.
Two separate probe panels
KATHMANDU: Nepal Police has constituted two separate probe panels to look into the security lapse and shooting in the jail. A high-level panel led by AIG Rabindra Pratap Shah of the Department of Crime Investigation, includes DIG Parshuram Khatri and SSP Madhav Prasad Joshi as members. Another panel is led by SSP Hemanta Mall Thakuri and includes SSP Kedarman Singh Bhandari and DSP Lal Mani Acharya.

An officer involved in the probe said preliminary investigations showed that the two inmates, who had managed to escape from the jail on Tuesday, had used cell phones to communicate and plan the escape. He also slammed the police for not stopping the inmates from using cell phones.
""We found the inmates managed to take cell phones inside the jail due to lack of proper security check-ups,"" the officer revealed. The inmates had escaped by making a hole in the compound wall of the jail. In the second jail break in Surkhet in last 10 years, Purna Bahadur Shahi, a rape convict, and Bijay Bikram Shah, remanded for abduction, had escaped from the Surkhet jail.
The Prison Act 2011 has banned the use of cell phones by inmates. The international law on human rights allows use of communication facilities by the prisoners of conscience but there are no such prisoners in Surkhet jail.

  The Minister of State for Environment and Forests, Shri Namo Narain Meena has said that India has become the target of poachers and smugglers and the enforcement infrastructure available with the center and State is inadequate to deal with the situation. 
  While addressing a one-day Seminar on Wildlife Crime Prevention here today, Shri Meena said that India has been one of the prime targets of organized illegal international trade in wild animals and their derivatives in the global market, particularly those of tiger, leopard, elephant, one-horned rhinoceros and a large variety of plants and insects species. Highlighting the growing trend in poaching and illegal trade in wild animals and their parts, the Minister asked the enforcement agencies in the States and the Centre to act in a coordinated fashion to tackle the crime. 
  He said that his ministry has taken a number of preventive measures for conservation and protection of wildlife including the amendment made to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 making the punishments for offences more stringent. The Minister said that his ministry has also set up regional offices at Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai for wildlife preservation and prevention of smuggling of wild animals and their products. Five more Regional Offices are also proposed in the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of Guwahati, Chandigarh, Bareilly, Silchar and Jabalpur. These units would focus on the international borders areas to combat wildlife crimes, he said. 
  Shri Meena said that a committee set up by his Ministry under the Chairmanship of Dr. S. Subramanian had recommended the establishment of a centralized Wildlife Crime Data Bank to collect, collate and analyse data on wildlife and to provide implementable guidelines to the field staff besides a Central Task Force with branches in important centers for coordinating with other enforcement agencies. He further said that with the recent amendment to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, an enabling provision has been made for creation of a National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which will ensure coordination, data base creation and intelligence gathering in the field of wildlife crime. However, the Minister said, the enforcement of the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 would continue to remain with the States/Union Territories which would be provided with funding support under the ongoing centrally sponsored schemes for creating a small set up under the State Chief Wildlife Warden as recommended by the Tiger Task Force appointed by the Prime Minister. The CBI has been empowered under the Wildlife (Protection) Act to apprehend and prosecute wildlife offenders. This organization is investigating several important wildlife offence cases. India is also a signatory to several international conventions including CITES, which regulate international trade in wildlife. We have a protocol with China and our delegates have met recently for addressing the issue of trafficking of wildlife body parts. 
  Further, there is a Memorandum of Understanding with Nepal and periodically notes are exchanged for re-enforcing protection measures to safeguard wildlife. 
  Earlier, Director, CBI, Shri Vijay Shanker said that recent investigations by CBI indicates that wildlife criminals are highly organized with a streamlined network of poachers and middlemen having international connections. Shri Shanker informed the Seminar that CBI is fostering international cooperation for combating wildlife crime. 
  About one hundred participants including senior police officers, forest officers from States and Union Territories, officer of SSB, BSF, DRI, Customs, Enforcement Directorate and forensic experts from Wildlife Institute of India are participating in the Seminar and trying to find ways and means to effectively tackle the growing menace of wildlife crime in the country. The Seminar, organized by the Central Bureau of Investigation in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, is deliberating on intelligence sharing, coordination among different law enforcement agencies and on issues relating to prosecution of wildlife offences in the courts of law.

He met Tuesday with a leader of the Nepali Congress (NC), former prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, cabinet sources told AFP.
Senior leaders of the main political parties, including the NC, have said they will not cooperate with Thapa's government, but he is continuing efforts to meet with NC president Girija Prasad Koirala and NCP-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal in the next couple of days, the sources said.
Thapa was appointed by King Gyanendra last month after the resignation of then prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
Gyanendra had appointed Chand after sacking the elected prime minister and indefinitely postponing elections last October, angering the political parties, who are demanding the restoration of the dissolved parliament or fresh elections.
Sources close to Thapa said he would work hard to fulfill these demands but wanted to discuss them with the opposition leaders first as well as get their support for a resumption of peace talks with Maoist rebels.
Chand's government declared a ceasefire with the guerrillas on January 29 and held two round of peace talks, but the third round has been delayed by the change in government.
""The prime minister is making tireless efforts for dialogue with political leaders to seek their advice and suggestions on restoring peace and security,"" a cabinet source said.
Minister for Information and Communications Kamal Thapa met with the four facilitators of the peace dialogue Wednesday to discuss the date and venue for the third round of talks, state radio said.
A government source said the talks could resume as early as Friday.

 Kathmandu, 19 June: The Maoist-aligned student wing All Nepal National Independent Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) is forcing school students of the Kathmandu Valley to take its membership.
 ""The ANNISU-R students storm into the schools and force students of classes eight, nine and 10 take their membership. They don't take the consent of the principal to enter into the classes, and force the students for the membership,"" said Karna Bahadur Shahi, president of National Private and Boarding Schools Association Nepal (N-PABSAN). ""If any school tries to resist, they threaten the management.""
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 20 Jun 03
""I feel that we have been pulled into politics forcefully,"" said a student of Zenith English Boarding School here, who did not want to be named. ""I showed no interest in taking the membership, but the revolutionaries took my name and phone number and asked other students to contact them through me.""
 ""The schools are helpless,"" said Umesh Shrestha, president of Private and Boarding Schools Organization Nepal (PABSON). He also said that PABSON strongly objects such activities by the union.
 ""It is wrong to involve politics in the school level,"" said Shrestha. ""Schools students are not mature enough to be a member of any such political organization.""
 However, Kabi Gautam, member of ANNISU-R claims that they have not been forcing the students. According to him, they have registered 400,000 student members. Gautam said that they were trying to bring in 95 per cent of all the students in their union.
 Denying the charges that the Maoists' activities are hampering the schools of the students, Gautam said that Kathmandu students have not missed any class in rallies and protests, and who ever participated, did so willingly.
 According to a student of Bhanu Bhakta Memorial School, classes eight, nine and 10 were given long lectures boasting about the union. Apart from lecturing the students, they have also told the students not to pay their tuition fees for two months.  passage omitted

  The selection of candidates triggered rebellion in the party. Now, the rebel group has decided to support Mayankeshwar Pandey who will contest election as an independent candidate from Sadar.
  Besides, thousands of BJP workers have refused to accept sitting Hindu Mahasabha MLA Dr RMD Agrawal as BJP candidate from this constituency.
  They requested Naidu to change the candidate but Vankaih Naidu has rejected their demand saying that stern action would be taken against those party workers who would not support Agarwal, party's official candidate.
  According to party sources, the BJP rebel group held a meeting at Golghar and decided to field Pandey as an independent candidate.
  Addressing the meeting secretary of the University Teachers' Association Dr Chandra Bhushan Ankur said office bearers of Commissioner Bar Association, Oil Traders Organisation, Nepal Club, Rotary Club and Jay Cee Club have decided to support Pandey.
  Meanwhile, a senior BJP leader Shambhu Sharan Singh, who was denied party ticket, decided to contest the election as an independent candidate from Maniram assembly seat.
  Former BJP MLA TP Shukla is fighting election from Sahjanwa as an independent candidate.
  He may face a tough challenge from the rebels.
  Though Naidu said that opposition to Adityanath's candidates would be treated as opposition to the BJP leadership, it failed to send a clear message to the party workers.

"1276",20032208,"Title: Maoist rebels kidnap British army officials in Nepal.rtf; Date: October 20, 2003 Monday; Text: Maoist rebels kidnapped two British army officers and three Nepalese from a remote mountain village, an official said - the first time the insurgents have reportedly abducted foreigners since their violent campaign began in 1996.
Authorities were expected to launch a search for the men Tuesday.
The British officers were trekking in the area, recruiting young Nepalese men to work as Gurkha soldiers in the British army, Baglung district chief Prem Narayan Sharma said Monday.
The rebels are opposed to Nepalese men working for foreign armies, and call them mercenaries.
The British had camped at Lekhali village, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) northwest of the capital, Katmandu, when they were kidnapped Sunday night along with three Nepalese workers.
The British Embassy in Katmandu confirmed that a team of five British Gurkhas had been out of contact since Sunday, but declined to give more details.
Soldiers and police were to start searching for the men at dawn Tuesday, police official Biswo Niranjan Pradhan told The Associated Press by telephone.
Gurkhas began serving the United Kingdom in 1815 in India, and with Indian independence in 1947 became part of the British army. Nearly 3,600 serve now, and in recent years they have taken part in British operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone.
The rebels, who say they're inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. The government has labeled them terrorists. More than 7,500 people have been killed in the insurgency.
The Defense Ministry said that at least 25 rebels were killed in at least half a dozen clashes with government troops over the past few days.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since the insurgents pulled out of peace talks and a seven-month cease-fire in August.

""The Maoist party has decided to suspend all military actions from October 20 to October 28 to allow the Nepalese to celebrate the Dasain festival ... in response to appeals of human rights groups and individuals,"" a Maoist statement said.
Dasain celebrates the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga who vanquished demons and saved humanity. It is the scenic Himalayan kingdom's most popular festival, bringing together family and friends.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and replace it with communist rule in an increasingly bloody battle that has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
There was no immediate reaction from the government to the ceasefire announcement.
A group of prominent Nepali civilians headed by retired Supreme Court judge Krishna Jung Rayamajhi set up a peace commission this week and called for a truce for the festival.
Violence has surged here since a peace dialogue and ceasefire collapsed in August 2003, with on average eight people dying daily in insurgency-related incidents.
Prime Minister Sher Deuba has said his government wants peace and is waiting for the Maoists to reply to a recent offer of talks.
But Maoist chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda or the ""fierce one,"" said in the statement the ""inability"" to reply to the rebels' demands had ""clearly shown the capabilities of the present government.""
The Maoists' demand for a constituent assembly, which ultimately aims at seeing the world's only Hindu kingdom being declared a secular republic, has scuttled two previous attempts to reach peace.
A growing number of rebel deaths in ""artificial encounters (with security forces) show that the old regime is not at all in favour of a dialogue and peace,"" Prachanda added.
In the latest violence, the army said, 14 Maoist rebels were killed in three clashes in the east and west of the country overnight.
Human rights groups have accused both sides in the insurgency of brutal human rights atrocities.

"174",20032231,"Title: Maoists close office in Kathmandu due to 'harassment'.rtf; Date: July 20, 2003 Sunday; Text: Maoist rebels, who are engaged in peace talks with the Nepalese government, announced Sunday they have closed their public relations office in Kathmandu with immediate effect due to ""harassment.""
The secretary of the public relations office, Bharat Dhungana, issued a press statement announcing the closure, saying it was linked to the government's close monitoring of the rebels' activities.
Dhungana appealed to the public to strongly protest against what he said was regime's intention to foil the peace process.
""We appeal to the people to strongly protest against such a deceptive move … and pressure (the government) to create a congenial atmosphere for the third round of peace dialogue.""
The government and the rebels have held two rounds of informal talks in the past 10 days in a bid to resolve disputes holding up negotiations to end the seven-year conflict, but have made little headway.
The rebels and the government declared a ceasefire in January, halting the insurgency that has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
They have held two sessions of official talks but the last was more than two months ago and no date has been fixed for a third.
Dhungana said he had been ""kidnapped"" in broad daylight while waiting for a bus on the outskirts of Kathmandu last week.
""While under the security personnel's custody, I was blindfolded, tortured and insulted in the course of interrogation forcing me to inform whether or not the Maoist high command is desirious of holding peace talks,"" he said.
Once freed he had sought assurances for his safety from Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, the leader of the government's talks team as well as team member Kamal Thapa, the Information and Communications minister, but this had not been forthcoming.
""They could not give any guarantee for the safety of our public relations office and myself,"" the statement said, giving reasons for the office's closure.

   Ministry of Health has started screening in Birgunj bordering  to India, some 90 km south of capital Kathmandu, Sunaul, some 185  south of capital Kathmandu from Monday. ""We also have screening at  Tatopani border in Nepal-China border, 40 km north of capital,""  Upreti told Xinhua. 
    In an attempt to tackle virus A/H5N1, Nepal had done enough  preparation for the control of it for which we have designated  certain hospitals and isolation centers like in Kathmandu. We have  Teku hospital and Teaching hospital designated to test the  patients. 
    In comparison of A/H5N1, pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus is not  severe. Mortality rate with A/H1N1 flu infection is less than 0.5  percent, said Upreti, adding ""If 200 people get sick, probably  only one percent will die."" 
    ""This is very high in bird flu, 60-80 percent of total infected  die in A/H5N1, so were already prepared our hospitals with the  perspective to control the bird flu so we are best prepared to  deal with the case of A/H1N1,"" he said. 
    ""However, we do not say there will not be loopholes in hospital  so we are closely monitoring those hospitals closely for the  treatment of these cases,"" Upreti said. 
    The A/H1N1 flu pandemic cases has reportedly spread to more  than 140 countries. 
    According to Upreti, crowd is the factor which propagates  infection so any place where there is crowd, its better to avoid  and maintain social distance. 
    Recently Nepal is cooperating with the WHO, United States  Agency for International Development, International Federation of  Red Cross, United Nations Children's Fund, Humanitarian Pandemic  Preparedness (H2P), Nepal Red Cross Society, Save the Children  Nepal and some local level organization to disseminate information  to aware people in community level.

"7349",20118836,"Title: UN approves no-fly zone over Libya.rtf; Date: March 18, 2011 Friday; Text: UNITED NATIONS, March 18 -- Moving swiftly in response to a request by Arab nations, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday paved the way for international air strikes against Moammar Gadhafi's forces, voting to authorize military action to protect civilians and impose a no-fly zone over Libya.
The council acted five days after the Arab League urged the U.N.'s most powerful body to try to halt Gadhafi's advancing military and reverse the realities on the ground, where rebels and their civilian supporters are in danger of being crushed by pro-government forces using rockets, artillery, tanks and warplanes.
The vote was 10-0 with five countries abstaining including Russia and China, which have veto power in the council, along with India, Germany and Brazil. Russia and China expressed concern about the United Nations and other outside powers using force against Gadhafi, and Germany expressed fear that military action would lead to more casualties.
The United States - which in a dramatic reversal joined the resolution's initial supporters Britain, France and Lebanon - not only helped push for a quick vote but pressed for action beyond creation of a no-fly zone to protect civilians from air, land and sea attacks by Gadhafi's fighters.
""This council moved with remarkable speed in response to the great urgency of the situation on the ground,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said. ""This resolution should send a strong message to Colonel Gadhafi and his regime that the violence must stop, the killing must stop, and the people of Libya must be protected and have the opportunity to express themselves freely.""
The resolution bans all flights in Libya's airspace to help protect civilians. It also authorizes U.N. member states to take ""all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory.""
U.S. officials said the resolution provides a strong legal base for enforcing the no-fly zone and for countries to carry out air and sea strikes against Gadhafi's forces.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters in Tunisia on Thursday that a U.N. no-fly zone over Libya would require action to protect the planes and pilots, ""including bombing targets like the Libyan defense systems.""
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the three criteria for taking action - a demonstrated need, clear legal basis and broad regional support - all have been fulfilled.
""This places a responsibility on members of the United Nations, and that is a responsibility to which the United Kingdom will now respond,"" he said.
Libya's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi, whose support for the opposition spurred many Libyan diplomats around the world to demand Gadhafi's ouster, called on the world to respond ""immediately.""
""The lives of the civilians are in danger right now and I expect the international community to move quickly,"" he said.
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said with the ""strong legal base,"" Britain and a number of other countries in NATO and a number of Arab League countries ""will be looking to implement those measures."" Diplomats said Arab countries likely to participate in possible strikes include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.
In Britain, a lawmaker with knowledge of defense matters confirmed that British forces were on standby for air strikes and could be mobilized as soon as Thursday night. The lawmaker declined to be named because the Defense Ministry has not issued official confirmation.
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon told France-2 Television that France would support military action against Gadhafi within a matter of hours after the resolution was approved.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the council had taken ""an historic decision"" to protect civilians from violence perpetrated by their own government. ""Given the critical situation on the ground, I expect immediate action on the resolution's provisions,"" he said.
Immediately before the vote, France's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe urged adoption of the resolution saying sanctions imposed by the Security Council on Feb. 26 aren't enough and ""violence against the civilian population has been redoubled.""
""We have very little time left. It's a matter of days. It's perhaps a matter of hours. We should not arrive too late,"" he said.
In the opposition capital Benghazi, Al-Jazeera satellite TV channel showed a large crowd watching the vote on an outdoor TV projection burst into celebration when the resolution was approved as green and red fireworks exploded in the air.
The resolution came hours after Gadhafi went on Libyan television and vowed to crush the rebellion with a final assault on Benghazi.
In an interview broadcast just before the vote, Gadhafi said, ""the U.N. Security Council has no mandate. We don't acknowledge their resolut"

Excerpt from interview of Nepal Maoist woman leader Pampha Bhusal by Netra Panthi entitled: ""I was of a rebellious nature since a child: Nepal Maoist leader"", published by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 6 July
[Rajdhani] What do you think is a good thing that you have done in your life?
[Bhusal] The role that I have played from my station in reaching this point through direct participation in the struggle against feudal exploitation of the Nepali people that goes back thousands of years.
[Rajdhani] How did you feel when killing people in battle?
[Bhusal] The people's war was needed urgently for the forward movement of Nepali society. The objective reality is that social transformation will not take place without sacrifice. Twelve thousand comrades in arms, leaders, workers and ordinary people have been killed. Thousands who obstructed the liberation war have been killed. I look upon this as a natural course of war. Man's life is the most significant thing. Losing a fellow traveller physically is emotionally painful but intellectually I look upon death as a necessity.
[Rajdhani] How did your political life start?
[Bhusal] As I grew up against a feudal social background, I had longings for social change. I was somewhat of a rebellious nature and would speak out even if I felt the lease injustice. I ended up in organizational work while participating in educational and social movements during the Panchayat era [of undemocratic rule]. I became a member of the communist party some 26 years ago.
[Rajdhani] What is your political objective? How far have you succeeded?
[Bhusal] Total liberation of the Nepali people. The liberation of the proletariat. We are on the ladder of success. We are climbing the steps towards an end to feudalism. We are climbing the ladder of a classless society.
[Rajdhani] Will you engage in politics in the cities or will you go to the villages?
[Bhusal] I am now in the city on political work. I will return to the villages. One has to arrange such things.
[Rajdhani] Did you participate directly in the battlefront?
[Bhusal] There was no direct battlefront participation. There was of course responsibility for planning and policy making before every assault. I did exercise ""command"" from a distance of a few hours from the battlefront.
[Rajdhani] You did of course move about with the people's army?
[Bhusal] During the war it was with the people's army that we moved about. They would provide for our security.
[Rajdhani] You must know a lot about weaponry.
[Bhusal] I know all the weapons. I myself carry ordinary arms like Mauser pistols and also use them. And when needed, I can use SMGs [sub-machine-guns], rifles and SLRs [self-loading rifles].
[Rajdhani] Did you have any difficult days in the people's war because you were a woman?
[Bhusal] No. When the war started I was already in the leadership.

 Kathmandu, 12 December: Convinced that the Druk Bhutanese government is pussyfooting on the Bhutanese refugee issue, the government is thinking of abandoning the bilateral route and formally opting for internationalization of the problem to pressurize Bhutan.
 Bhutan has not responded to Nepal's repeated calls for resumption of the stalled bilateral process to resolve the refugee stalemate due to India's ""tacit backing"".
 ""Curiously, India says we should resolve the issue bilaterally, but it supports the Bhutanese government, which is not willing to go it bilaterally,"" said an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who did not want to be named. ""So we are thinking of internationalizing the issue to pressurize Bhutan, and India to support such a move.""
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 12 Dec 04
But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) is in a fix.
 ""If we wait for the reluctant Druk government to resume the stalled process, it could take months, even years,"" the MoFA official spoke of the dilemma.
 And if Nepal ""internationalizes"" the issue, then not only could Bhutan walk away from the issue, but an ""impatient"" international community, whose ""role has become dubious to say the least"", in the words of a former foreign minister, could insist on local integration of refugees as a primary solution. The other two options are repatriation, the first choice of a majority of the refugees, and settlement in third countries.
 ""We are against any such formula that will end the prospect of refugees returning to their homeland,"" Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya said, when asked for his comment. He declined to elaborate.
 The Nepalese government is staunchly against integration of refugees in Nepal. They say it is akin to penalizing Nepal for no fault of its own, whereas Bhutan is allowed to go scot-free despite the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its own citizens.
 MoFA officials are also irked by Bhutan's recent proposal of taking in, initially, only the refugees in Category 1 (Bhutanese forcibly evicted) which comprise only 2.4 per cent or 293 of 12,183 refugees of Khudunabari camp where verification and categorization have been completed. The Nepalese government, however, has rejected the proposal of repatriating only these refugees.
 What has shifted the balance in Bhutan's favour, officials maintain, is India's backing of Bhutan on the latter's security concern for its officials in the JVT Joint Verification Team after the Khudunabari incident.
 On 22 December last year, enraged and humiliated refugees in the Khudunabari camp had pelted stones at Bhutanese JVT officials after the latter read out ""objectionable and unilateral"" (as per MoFA statement of 25 December) conditions, which the refugees would have to follow once they were repatriated to the Druk kingdom. Two Druk officials and a Nepali policeman were injured in the scuffle.
 Nepal has pledged extraordinary security for Bhutanese officials: from ferrying them in helicopters to facilitating interviews with refugees in Damak or even in Biratnagar or even inside an army barrack.
 Although Bhutan has accepted the probe report into the Khudunabari incident as well as its outcome, it has not been willing to resume the bilateral process.
 An obliged India is going out of its way to appease the Bhutanese government to return the favour - the Bhutanese ""drive"" against ULFA United Liberation Front of Assam and Bodo militants from the camps in Bhutan. The monarch is visiting New Delhi again after his November sojourn: King Jigme Singye Wangchuck is the chief guest for this year's Republic Day celebrations on 26 January.
 While the Druk monarch is in India, Nepalese officials want the Indian government to ponder the fate of over 110,000 refugees in the seven camps of eastern Nepal.

In India alone the number of dead topped 1,000 with new victims reported from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam where 25 of 27 districts are inundated.
There were 21 deaths overnight in three eastern districts hardest hit by the heavy flooding, Uttar Pradesh relief commissioner Umesh Sinha told AFP.
""An estimated 20 million people are believed to be affected in all three countries in what is being described as the worst flooding in living memory,""  the United Nations' children's fund UNICEF said in a statement.
""The sheer size and scale of the flooding and the massive numbers of people affected poses an unprecedented challenge to the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian assistance,"" it said.
A total of 1,028 people have died in India in the annual downpour that begins in June and lasts until September, according to officials and media reports.
""The situation is under control now,"" Sinha said after announcing 1,650 paramilitary and army personnel had been deployed along with civilian rescue teams to help some 1.4 million flood-hit people.
Many rivers were in spate, breaching embankments and dykes, he added.
The weather office in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state, forecast  ""heavy to very heavy rains expected in the next 24 hours."" 
The monsoon regularly brings flooding to South Asia but this year has seen some of the worst in recent times with the north and east particuarly hard hit.
In neighbouring Bihar state, chief minister Nitish Kumar described the flood situation as ""grim"" with more than seven million people cut off by overflowing rivers.
""It's not possible to reach all the people by boat. The only alternative is airdropping relief material,"" Kumar said of the state's worst-hit Darbhanga district.
""Sixteen of the state's 38 districts are under water. That means some 3,614 villages are affected,"" A.K Chowdhury, Bihar chief secretary told AFP by phone.
Flooding has destroyed crops planted over 630,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) and early estimates suggest losses of 450 million rupees (11 million dollars) in the state, he said.
""The flood situation is very very serious, the situation we have now is unprecedented in the past 30 years,"" Chowdhury said.
Further east in Bangladesh, authorities reported another 11 deaths taking the annual monsoon toll to 191.
Disaster management minister Tapan Chowdhury said thousands of army and civilian personnel had been mobilised.
Around 6.9 million Bangladeshis were either displaced or marooned in villages, he said, adding that of those an estimated 200,000 had taken refuge in government shelters.
""We are distributing dried food to people by boat but in some places we cannot reach people because of lack of boats so we are making rafts by cutting banana trees,"" said district relief officer Abul Khaer in northern Sirajganj district.
Nepal has also been badly hit and the death toll rose Friday to 87, the home ministry said.
Some 32 of the Himalayan nation's 75 districts have been affected. Biratnagar, a border town close to India, reported 223 millimetres (8.8 inches) of rain in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, further downstream in eastern West Bengal state and northeastern Assam where 5.5 million people have been hit, matters were improving, a government spokesman said.
""The situation is on the mend,"" Bhumidhar Barman, Assam's relief minister, told AFP. ""We have had no rains in the past 48 hours.""
A Central Water Commission bulletin said water-levels in all the major rivers and their tributaries were receding.
""Some people have already started leaving the 3,500 relief camps and are going back to their villages although a vast majority of the 5.5 million people affected are unable to return as their homes are filled with mud,"" Barman said.

  Koirala, who played a proactive role in the signing of the CPA, urged all members of his party, the Nepali Congress, to ensure that the peace agreement was implemented in totality. ""We should try to ensure that evil forces do not succeed in derailing the peace process,"" Koirala said.
  The pace of change has left many Nepalis optimistic of better times, but wary of the challenges that lie ahead if promises and deals are to be turned into lasting peace.
  ""What until recently was an improbable peace has become a reality,"" the Kathmandu Post said in an editorial. ""The signing on a piece of paper will have no meaning in itself if the stakeholders concerned fail to abide by the accord in its true spirit"", it said, according to Reuters.

 People from different VDCs village development committee areas in the remote mid-western district of Dailekh Mid-Western Development Region, far west Nepal who were taking refuge at the district headquarters as internally displaced people (IDPs) have begun returning to their respective villages with the help of local journalists and rights activists, but are facing severe food shortages, reports said.
 According to reports, the villagers said they discovered that food grains and other supplies from their houses had been looted from their houses after they had fled to district headquarter of Khalanga, fearing Maoist reprisal.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 21 Dec 04
Over 1,600 people belonging to nearly 450 families from Naumule, Toli, Baluwatar, Salleri, Kalika and Dwari VDCs from the district had fled their villages to the district headquarters demanding protection following Maoists abduction and killing of local people for allegedly defying their diktat.
 On 19 November, the Maoists brutally killed Mahendra Subedi, the head of one of the committees formed by local people to resist against the alleged Maoist atrocities. Maoists accused him of encouraging other villagers to retaliate against them, along with five other villagers including an eight-year-old boy.
 Hundreds of displaced people who are still taking refuge at the district headquarters of Dailekh are in deplorable conditions due to lack of proper assistance from the government and other donor agencies.
 According to reports, a total of 150 villagers belonging to 25 families have already returned to Goganpani following an agreement between the local Maoists and journalists after many displaced people refused to heed the Maoist call to return home. Before making the call, the western central command of the Maoists had formed a probe committee to investigate into the 19 November killings of civilians by its cadres.

"5230",20065349,"Title: Nepal king may yet cling on to his crown.rtf; Date: April 24, 2006 Monday 7:47 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra, who late Monday agreed to reinstate the parliament he dissolved in 2002 after massive and violent street protests, may yet get to retain his crown despite his unpopularity.
With western powers and neighbouring India concerned that Maoist rebels would take control of the country should the monarch be forced to abdicate, intense behind-the-scenes talks took place at the royal palace Monday which resulted in the late night announcement, diplomatic sources said.
Last week the US ambassador pointed out that Washington would not like to see the world's last Hindu monarch forced to flee his kingdom clinging to the bottom of a helicopter.
Following his agreement to reinstate parliament however, Washington was more upbeat but called for a commitment by the monarch to return to his ceremonial role and stay out of politics completely.
King Gyanendra was vaulted to the throne in June 2001 in bizarre circumstances when his brother, King Birendra, and other royals were murdered at the palace by a drunken crown prince who later shot himself.
But the unsmiling monarch never attained the popularity of his more genial, well-loved brother, who was seen as a symbol of unity in Nepal.
The monarch, traditionally revered as the incarnation of the Hindu god of protection, Lord Vishnu, sacked the government and seized power in February 2005, saying the move was necessary to crush a deadly decade-old Maoist revolt.
King Gyanendra gave himself three years to restore elected rule and end the insurgency. But he has now been forced to announce he was cutting short his absolute rule after just 14 months.
During that time, he became even more unpopular and the political parties formed a loose pro-democracy alliance with the Maoists.
He was best known before he became king for the nightclub antics of his errant son Paras who is now crown prince.
King Gyanendra had missed the 2001 massacre because he was away in the west of Nepal. Paras was present but escaped unscathed.
Maoist rebels accused the king of stage-managing the killings and at his coronation large crowds shouted slogans against him. An official probe found that Crown Prince Dipendra was responsible for the massacre.
Some observers have compared King Gyanendra's style to that of his autocratic father King Mahendra who staged a coup in 1960 against the then-elected government. Mahendra imposed a party-less system that remained in place until 1990.
King Gyanendra has a reputation as politically shrewd, but is believed to have opposed Birendra's decision in 1990 to reduce the monarchy to a constitutional figurehead.
He was educated at a Jesuit school in Darjeeling, India, and graduated from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu in 1969.
The middle son of Mahendra, he is said to be one of the world's wealthiest royals, with substantial properties and investments abroad. He is known for his keen interests in poetry and the environment.
During political upheavals in 1950, he was declared monarch at the age of five after being left behind as insurance when then-king Tribhuvan -- his grandfather -- fled to India.
The crown reverted back to his grandfather when the family returned a year later and Birendra took over the throne in 1972.
The pro-democracy Kathmandu Post last week warned that already it may be too late for King Gyanendra to prevent the crown being taken away from him for a second time.
""For the king, time has run out,"" it said. ""No ruler can get away by killing innocent people.
""We believe the king has gone to the extent of no return. Even if he restores people's sovereignty as per people's wishes, he may not be able to protect the 237-year-old institution.""

Text of report by Radio Nepal on 11 December
National Human Rights Commission says that the human rights situation remained challenging during Fiscal Year 2062/63 [last year]. In its annual report, the NHRC says that the rights situation remained dire because of the royal rule, the 11-year-long armed conflict and the suppression by the royal government of the movement launched by seven political parties.
The state indulged in disappearing citizens, carried out extra-judicial killing of those in custody, tortured them and even murdered by security forces instead of arresting them. Since individual rights to information was suspended the rights situation had been critical, the report said. Similarly, the cases of abuses increased during the period also because of widespread of violations by Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists. The NHRC says that the Maoists have not implemented any suggestions recommended by the Commission so far and that repeated requests to the Maoists to inform the Commission on the situation of the recommendations thus made have proved futile The government's non-appointment of Commission officials even to this day has made its activities ineffective.

 Bhusal also said the Maoists goals were beyond a constituent assembly and that this was only a stepping stone for their ultimate destination.

King Gyanendra accepted Lokendra Bahadur Chand's resignation and began consulting with members of the nation's five largest political parties to form a new Cabinet.
""My resignation, I hope, will pave way to resolve the present conflict,"" Chand said.
Political leaders planned to meet over the weekend to continue talks on forming a new government.
The king appointed Chand after firing an elected government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba on Oct. 11 for seeking to delay parliamentary elections scheduled for November because of threats from Maoist rebels.
""We told the king the only way out of this political crisis is by forming a new government and reinstating Parliament,"" Narayanman Bijuchche of the Nepal Workers and Peasant's Party said after the meeting.
Bijuchche hinted that Chand's successor could be Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, the second largest political party.
The main opposition parties called Chand's appointment unconstitutional and began a series of protests this month. Although the king has the authority to dismiss the elected government, critics say he went too far in firing Deuba.
On Wednesday, about 5,000 people protested in Katmandu and marched toward the parliament building.
They were blocked by police who used batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least two dozen were injured, including former parliament members and important political leaders.
Gyanendra ascended the throne in 2001 after his brother, Birendra, and eight other members of the royal family were gunned down by the crown prince, who then took his own life.
Deuba was fired after he moved to postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for November 2002, citing security concerns about the communist rebels. More than 7,000 people have been killed since their insurgency started in 1996.

Surkhet [west Nepal]: Following continuous Maoist interference, thousands of residents of Birendranagar in Surkhet have been prevented from paying their telephone, electricity and other utility bills.
People are suffering because of the Maoist demand for a 50 per cent share of the revenue collected. The rebels went to the offices of Nepal Electricity Authority and Nepal Telecom to push through their demand, and created obstructions in the revenue collection points of some other offices.
Nepal Telecom has not been able to collect charges for three days due to the Maoists, while the Electricity Authority says there has been a reduction in the number of customers coming to pay their bills as there is a sense of fear due to the collection of fees in the presence of the police.
Likewise, Maoists have been raising taxes from some other areas in Surkhet after removing the district development office and the district forest office, the offices concerned said.

"6173",20072928,"Title: Nepal 's Ex-Rebels Quit Government.rtf; Date: September 18, 2007 Tuesday 9:09 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's former rebels quit the government Tuesday and threatened widespread protests, sparking a political crisis that threatened to undermine this Himalayan nation's peace process.
The one-time rebels, known as the Maoists, say they have no plans to renew their armed revolt.
They were planning a mass gathering in central Katmandu later Tuesday where they were expected to detail their plans for protests against the government, which they say has been too slow to declare Nepal a republic and meet their other demands.
The withdrawal from the government was confirmed by senior minister Ram Chandra Poudel, who is a member of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the administration.
""The Maoist ministers gave their resignation and left. In the notice, they have alleged that the coalition government has failed to function in the spirit of the agreements reached earlier and have not been able to prepare for upcoming elections,"" Poudel told The Associated Press.
Leaders of the top four parties in the government, including the Maoists, met at the prime minister's residence Tuesday in a last-ditch attempt to avert a political crisis.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Maoist party leader Prachanda who goes by one name and leaders of the Nepali Congress Democratic and United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal met until early afternoon, when the negotiations broke down.
The former rebels had been threatening that they would walk out of the eight-party coalition government by Tuesday if the prime minister did not meet their demands, including one that Nepal become a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy.
They also are demanding that a commission investigate the disappearances of their supporters during their decade-long conflict against the government, which ended last year, as well as salaries for their former fighters and their integration into the national army.
The Maoists, who gave up their armed revolt last year to join the peace process and enter the government, have been demanding the Himalayan nation be immediately declared a republic. It has long been a monarchy, although the king currently holds no real power.
Other coalition partners have disagreed, saying it should be left for a special assembly to be elected in November to decide on Nepal's future political system while it rewrites the constitution.
The rebels linked up with the political parties last year, joining pro-democracy street protests against King Gyanendra's authoritarian rule. The demonstrations forced the monarch to give up direct rule.
The Maoists later declared a cease-fire, signed a peace agreement and confined their combatants and weapons to United Nations-monitored camps. They joined Nepal's parliament in January and the government in April.

 Kathmandu, 2 December: The ambassador of France to Nepal, Claude Ambrosini, said here today that the solution to the Maoist problem couldn't be attained through the ""sole use of arms"".
 The French envoy said that proper conditions had to be created to ensure political stability, which would be ""returning to the democratic multiparty system under the constitutional monarchy regime"", and the renewal of the dialogue between the government and the Maoists.

Vehicles stayed off the roads, forcing commuters to walk to their destinations.
Schools and college were closed, with thousands of students staying home. Shops and private businesses were also closed. Only a few pharmacies were open in Katmandu.
The rebels called the strike to mark the anniversary of their insurgency, which has claimed over 8,500 lives. They say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state.
Friday marks the eighth anniversary of the conflict.
General strikes ordered by the rebels are usually successful, because people are afraid to defy the rebels, considered ruthless toward those who do not comply with their calls.
Soldiers and policemen have been patrolling the streets and security has been beefed up due to the anniversary.
Bomb disposal units responded to at least two calls in the morning but found them to be hoaxes, police said.
Fighting has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August. The rebels walked out of peace talks and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.

Last January, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed during a visit here to provide new weapons to Nepal to bolster the Himalayan kingdom's antiterrorism campaign.
Washington has also pledged $17 million in military training and equipment, including light weaponry and night-vision gear.
The 3,000 M-16 A-2 assault rifles will replace the Nepalese army's traditional self-loading rifles, the source said.
Nepal had earlier procured about 5,000 M-16 guns, which its uses mainly to train Nepalese soldiers for U.N. peacekeeping missions. Another 500 sub-machine guns imported from Belgium are also expected to arrive this week.
Nepalese human rights organizations have criticized the government's procurement of modern weapons, saying it will escalate the violence and result in more killings of innocent civilians.
There are also widespread fears the new weapons could fall into rebel hands.
Maoist rebels have no known source of arms and supplies, but they have captured weapons from security forces during raids at police posts and army barracks.
According to unofficial figures, the rebels have so far snared more than 1,000 weapons, including light machine guns and Belgian-made automatic rifles.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996, demanding a new constitution to replace Nepal's current basic law.
They want to overthrow the country's monarchy and establish a one-party communist republic in Nepal.
According to government figures, more than 7,200 Nepalese have been killed since the outbreak of the communist insurgency.

Deuba was met at the airport by India's junior foreign minister E. Ahmed.
The Nepalese premier's five-day official visit comes amid increased violence in Nepal as Maoist rebels step up their efforts to overthrow the monarchy and impose communist rule.
As part of their campaign the Maoists have vowed to force the closure of 35 companies, including some Indian-run firms, by Friday on top of 12 they shut last month.
Deuba is due to meet his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Defence Minister P. Mukharji and other leaders.
India, which supplies weapons, military equipment and training to Nepal's ill-equipped security forces, shares a porous nearly 1,600-kilometer- (990-mile) long border with the Himalayan kingdom.
The Maoists, who already control vast areas of countryside, last month staged a week-long blockade of Kathmandu that they enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.

"1248",20032437,"Title: Nepal 's Maoist rebels and govt to sit for first round of formal talks.rtf; Date: April 27, 2003 Sunday; Text: Nepal's government and Maoist rebels are expected to sit down for a first round of formal peace talks later Sunday.
Teams from both sides will meet at 4:00 pm (1015 GMT) at a four-star hotel near the royal palace.
The venue was being guarded by plain clothes armed police officers, witnesses said.
The rebels and the government declared a ceasefire on January 29 and said they were willing to hold talks to end seven years of bloody insurgency.
The first round was originally planned for April 21, but the rebels pulled out at the last minute, complaining no substantive issues had been put on the agenda.
On Thursday government negotiator and Minister for Communications Ramesh Nath Pandey met with two Maoist leaders to set a new date.
""The informal talks we held with two Maoist negotiating team members K.B. Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa were very useful and created a congenial atmosphere for the official talks,"" Pandey said.
""Both His Majesty's government and the Maoist negotiators are participating in the peace dialogue fully understanding the need to protect national unity and also recognise the aspirations of the Nepalese people,"" he said.
Maoist sources said the first round of talks would include political issues.
""We are highly confident that there would be no obstacles now to start first round of peace dialogue between us and the officials,"" a highly placed Maoist source said.
""The official negotiators have agreed to start talking on all issues, including political issues, in the very first round of peace dialogue,"" the source said.
""The main thrust of the first round of peace talks will be political issues and the strict honouring of the Code of Conduct (CoC) for the talks and release of Maoist prisoners.""
According to the 22-point CoC, signed in March, both sides: are committed to finding a peaceful solution through dialogue; will stop violent activities including strikes and kidnappings; will gradually release prisoners; will not obstruct the transport of food and medicine; and will help displaced people return home.
Another Maoist source said they would be proposing the appointment of two neutral facilitators -- human rights activist Padma Ratna Tuladhar and ex-speaker Daman Nath Dhungana -- to be included in the peace talks.
The Maoist ""people's war"" for a communist republic has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996.
A previous attempt at peace talks in 2001 stalled after three rounds over the Maoist demand for the abolition of the monarchy.
But observers said the chances for peace seemed better this time around as the Maoists have toned down their rhetoric and said they were prepared to negotiate with the monarch, King Gyanendra.
""We want Nepal's king to be a patriotic and popular monarch working for the country and the people, like the Cambodian monarch, (King Norodom) Sihanouk,"" Maoist leader and negotiator Babu Ram Bhattarai said in an interview with AFP Friday.
Bhattarai came out of seven years of hiding last month, indicating that the Maoists were serious about the talks.
But the peace process has been complicated by the political situation in the Himalayan kingdom.
On October 4 King Gyanendra dismissed the elected prime minister, citing incompetence, and appointed a royalist interim government.
The Maoists and political parties say the government does not have a mandate to negotiate with the rebels.

"6633",20083747,"Title: Chinese Security Forces Swarm Tibet.rtf; Date: March 16, 2008 Sunday 6:09 AM GMT; Text: Soldiers on foot and in armored carriers swarmed Tibet's capital Saturday, enforcing a strict curfew a day after protesters burned shops and cars to vent their anger against Chinese rule. In another western city, police clashed with hundreds of Buddhist monks leading a sympathy demonstration.
The violence erupted just two weeks before China's Summer Olympic celebrations kick off with the start of the torch relay, which passes through Tibet. China is gambling that its crackdown will not draw an international outcry over human rights violations that could lead to boycotts of the Olympics.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on China ""to exercise restraint in dealing with these protests,"" while the State Department issued a travel alert for Americans in the region. Her statement also called for China to release monks and others jailed for protesting.
The latest unrest began Monday on the anniversary of a 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Tibet was effectively independent for decades before communist troops entered in 1950.
Initially, the protests were led by Buddhist monks demanding the release of other detained monks. Their demands spiraled to include cries for Tibet's independence and turned violent Friday when police tried to stop a group of protesting monks. Pent-up grievances against Chinese rule came to the fore, as Tibetans directed their anger against Chinese and their shops, hotels and other businesses.
It was the fiercest challenge to Beijing's authority in nearly two decades.
China's official Xinhua News Agency reported at least 10 civilians were burned to death on Friday. The Dalai Lama's exiled Tibetan government in India said Chinese authorities killed at least 30 Tibetans and possibly as many as 100. The figures could not be independently verified.
In the Tibetan capital Lhasa on Saturday, police manned checkpoints and armored personnel carriers rattled on mostly empty streets as people stayed indoors under a curfew, witnesses said. The show of force imposed a tense quiet.
Several witnesses reported hearing occasional bursts of gunfire. One Westerner who went to a rooftop in Lhasa's old city said he saw troops with automatic rifles moving through the streets firing, though did not see anyone shot.
Foreign tourists in Lhasa were told to leave, a hotel manager and travel guide said, with the guide adding that some were turned back at the airport.
""There are military blockades blocking off whole portions of the city, and the entire city is basically closed down,"" said a 23-year-old Canadian student who arrived in Lhasa on Saturday and who was making plans to leave. ""All the restaurants are closed, all the hotels are closed.""
Even as Chinese forces appeared to reassert control in Lhasa, a second day of sympathy protests erupted in an important Tibetan town 750 miles away.
Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Buddhist monks and other Tibetans after they marched from the historic Labrang monastery and smashed windows in the county police headquarters in Xiahe, witnesses said.
Also Saturday, fresh demonstrations by Tibetan exiles and their supporters sprouted up in neighboring Nepal, New York, Switzerland and Australia.
The Chinese government is hoping a successful Olympics will boost its popularity at home as well as its image abroad. But Beijing's hosting of the Olympics has already attracted scrutiny of China's human rights record and its pollution problems.
So far, international criticism of the crackdown in Tibet has been mild. The U.S. and European Union called for Chinese restraint without any threats of an Olympic boycott or other sanctions.
""What is happening in Tibet and Beijing's responses to it will not affect the games very much unless the issue really gets out of control,"" said Xu Guoqi, a China-born historian at Kalamazoo College in Michigan.
International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said Saturday he opposed an Olympic boycott over Tibet.
""We believe that the boycott doesn't solve anything,"" Rogge told reporters on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. ""On the contrary, it is penalizing innocent athletes and it is stopping the organization from something that definitely is worthwhile organizing.""
China restricts access to Tibet for foreign media, making it difficult to independently verify the casualties and the scale of protests and suppression.
Yet the details emerging from witness accounts and government statements suggested Beijing was preparing a methodical campaign one that if carefully modulated would minimize bloodshed and avoid wrecking Beijing's grand plans for the Aug. 8-24 Olympics.
The China-installed governor of Tibet vowed to deal harshly with the protesters in Lhasa, but said no shots had been fired and promised that ""calm will be restored very soon.""
""Beating, smashing, looting and burning we absolutely condemn this sort of behavior,"" Champa Phuntsok, an ethnic Tibetan, told reporters in Beijing.

"957",20031357,"Title: China, India agree to settle border disputes; Vajpayee visits Buddhist site.rtf; Date: June 25, 2003 Wednesday; Text: After signing a commitment to settle border disputes with Beijing, India's prime minister flew Wednesday to central China to visit an ancient Buddhist site - a symbol of cultural ties between the former Asian rivals.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's trip to Luoyang, a former imperial capital, came in the midst of a six-day visit to China that both sides describe as an effort to build closer ties after decades of Cold War mistrust.
Relations between Beijing and New Delhi have improved in recent years as they focused on trade, downplaying border disputes and such divisive issues as China's alliance with Pakistan, India's adversary in three wars.
The agreement announced Tuesday calls for China and India to reopen a stretch of their Himalayan border where they fought a 1962 war and have high-level envoys settle other territorial disputes.
Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said the agreement was a ""very important step forward.""
It calls for a reopening of trade between Tibet and the Indian territory of Sikkim.
The status of Sikkim, located between Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, has been a sticking point in relations. Once an independent principality, it was annexed in 1975 by India, but China never recognized it as an Indian possession and claims part of the territory as its own.
The agreement gave no sign that China had recognized Sikkim as Indian territory, and Sinha wouldn't give any more details.
Trade between the two sides totaled US$5 billion (NZ$8.6 billion) last year, and China says its imports from India in the first four months of this year were double the same period of 2002.
In Luoyang, Vajpayee toured the 1,500-year-old Longmen grottos, where thousands of Buddhist figures are carved into cliffs and caves. Buddhism, which originated in India, spread 20 centuries ago to China, where it became a core element of the country's culture.
Vajpayee invoked Buddhism on Monday in a speech in Beijing as a sign of historic Chinese-Indian ties, calling for a modern partnership in trade and diplomacy.
On Tuesday, Vajpayee said President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders were committed to building ""stable, enduring and forward-looking ties of friendship.""
Sinha quoted Hu as telling Vajpayee that his visit sent a message to the world that ""China and India are coming closer together.""
A declaration issued by Vajpayee and his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, said India recognized Tibet as part of China.
It said India won't allow ""anti-China political activities"" by Tibetan exiles, but Sinha said that would not affect the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader who lives in exile in India.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising against communist rule. China accuses him of agitating for independence.

The countries including economic giants Japan and China but also impoverished nations such as Laos agreed Thursday to improve coordination between their ministries of health and environment, and work to establish national frameworks to fight environmental health problems.
""We needed political will and we got that today,"" said Supat Wangwongwatana, director general of Thailand's Pollution Control Department in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.
""Fourteen countries committed to cooperate and work to combat environmental problems and improve the health of the people,"" he said. ""That's an achievement.""
No money, however, was committed during the two-day meeting dubbed the Bangkok Declaration on Environment and Health nor did the countries set any specific goals.
Water pollution and hazardous waste were also identified as environmental problems that impact people's health.
The ministerial forum, the first of its kind in the region, comes as a growing number of health problems are being linked to environmental changes, especially global warming associated with greenhouse gases.
The World Health Organization estimates climate change has already directly or indirectly killed more than 1 million people globally since 2000. Another 800,000 deaths worldwide each year have been linked to air pollution.
Last month, health officials from more than a dozen countries gathered in Malaysia to hear how rising temperatures were sparking more deadly landslides in Nepal, a rise in dengue fever cases throughout Asia, and increased flooding in India and Bangladesh.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N. network of 2,000 scientists, predicted earlier this year that droughts caused by rising temperatures will lower crop yields and raise malnutrition in some areas, and spark a surge in diseases such as diarrhea.
People living in low-lying coastal areas will also face more storms, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater that is vital for drinking, it said.
The ministers said environment and health problems had previously been tackled separately by most countries, but with Thursday's declaration they hoped that would change.
""Since the capacities of countries in the region to deal with environmental problems are limited, we need to have better intersectoral coordination,"" said Vallop Thainuea, an official from Thailand's Ministry of Public Health.

At least 376 people have died as a result of recent monsoons and floods in India and Bangladesh, including at least nine people who drowned when their boat sank Monday in India's northeastern Bihar state. Another 29 are missing, said N. Swaran Kumar, the district magistrate.
The U.N. Children's Fund warned in a statement that children are especially vulnerable to the ""looming health crisis.""
""Entire villages are days away from a health crisis if people are not reached in the coming days,"" Marzio Babille, UNICEF's health chief in India, said in the statement. ""Children, who make up 40 percent of South Asias population, are particularly susceptible.""
The threat of waterborne disease is high because wells have been contaminated by floodwaters, said L.B. Prasad, director-general of health in Uttar Pradesh state.
More than 1,000 people are reported sick, mainly from cholera and gastroenteritis in the Maharajganj, Gorakhpur and Bara Banki districts of India's northern Uttar Pradesh state, officials said.
UNICEF said millions of children were likely to be affected, but did not give a specific total. In Bihar, India's worst-hit state, the agency said stagnant waters had put about 11 million people, including 1.5 million children, at risk of contracting waterborne diseases.
In Bangladesh, there were 1,400 reported cases of diarrhea in the past 24 hours, said Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization.
The World Food Program and UNICEF have been distributing emergency food supplies to thousands of people in Bangladesh and Nepal, said WFP spokesman Simon Pluess in Geneva.
In India, UNICEF has provided oral rehydration and water purification tablets as well as emergency medical supplies, the agency said.
The Indian air force stepped up relief efforts, dropping supplies for 2 million people cut off by some of the worst flooding in Bihar in 30 years.
Authorities have been criticized for being too slow to respond to the crisis with too little aid.
Hundreds of angry villagers in the Darbhanga district of Bihar briefly kidnapped a senior official and the local police chief, only releasing them after receiving promises that an aid distribution center would be set up there, said Upendera Sharma, a local government official.
Since the start of the monsoon in June, the government says more than 1,200 people have died in India alone, with scores of others killed in Bangladesh and neighboring Nepal.
So far this year, some 14 million people in India and 5 million in Bangladesh have been displaced by flooding, according to government figures.
Officials have blamed the flooding on an unusual monsoon pattern, which UNICEF said called ""startling"" in magnitude and intensity.

 Following widespread criticism, the Maoists on Friday 8 October withdrew strikes in public transport in Udaypur district east Nepal , which was in place from Sunday. The rebels, however, have declared that the strikes in industries will continue.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 8 Oct 04
According to reports, Maoist leaders have told the local media that the strike in transport companies have been called off ""in view of the difficulties faced by common people in the face of Dashain festivals"".
 The rebels, meanwhile, continue to disrespect the calls made by the business communities, human rights organizations and the labour organizations. Leading industries including Udaypur Centre Factory remain closed due to the strike called by the Maoist-aligned All Nepal Trade Union Federation.

"4270",20052669,"Title: Two major opposition parties move to drop support for Nepal 's monarchy.rtf; Date: August 29, 2005 Monday 6:11 PM GMT; Text: Leaders of two major opposition parties in Nepal abandoned Monday their support of the country's 15-year-old constitutional monarchy in anger at King Gyanendra seizure of power in February.
A key committee of the country's oldest democratic party, the Nepali Congress, omitted support for the system from the party's statute for the first time in its 60-year-old history, members said.
Their decision will be put to a vote at the party's general convention beginning Tuesday.
""We have removed constitutional monarchy from the partys objectives,"" senior Congress leader Ram Sharan Mahat said.
""The relevance of monarchy will be kept open from now on and the party is not bound to constitutional monarchy now,"" he said.
""Constitutional monarchy was a sort of compromise between the king and the political forces in the country and since the king has violated the norms, we are not bound by the monarchy any more,"" he said.
The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), a royalist as well as leftwing party, made a similar decision.
A meeting of the party's central committee adopted a resolution to push for a democratic republic and an end to the ""autocratic monarchy,"" party general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said.
King Gyanendra's seizure of power and sacking of the elected government had undermined the ""historic people's movement"" that led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1990, he said.
The constitutional monarchy form of government, agreed after huge pro-democracy protests, replaced the 240-year-old monarchy's absolute grip on power.
The king's power grab meant it was ""quite natural for a republic issue to assume utmost importance in Nepal's political scenario,"" Nepal said in a statement.
He also reiterated his party's decision to hold talks with Maoists rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to establish a communist republic, on forming a broad front against King Gyanendra.
The Nepali Congress has also indicated its support for the alliance against the king.
King Gyanendra said after he took power and sacked a four-party coalition government in February that his action was prompted by the government's failure to curb the Maoist insurgency, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives since it was launched.

"2207",20045119,"Title: Nepalese protesters urge king to return executive powers.rtf; Date: April 1, 2004 Thursday 200404010554; Text: Thousands of Nepalese marched through central Kathmandu on Thursday, calling on King Gyanendra to return the executive powers he seized in October 2002.
 An estimated 50,000 people from six political parties participated in the march, shouting slogans against the king. The organizers said more than 150,000 took part in it.
The protesters carried placards that read 'Down with Regression' and 'We want a republic, not monarchy,' while chanting 'Long live multiparty democracy.'
 The political parties protested against what they call the 'regressive step' King Gyanendra took Oct. 4, 2002. At that time, the king dismissed then Prime Minister Sher Baradur Deuba and seized executive powers for himself.
 The organizers charged that the government blocked several thousands of protesters from across the country from entering the capital to participate in the march.
 Following the march, party leaders including Girija Prasad Koirala, president of the Nepali Congress Party and a former prime minister, staged a sit-in at the main road leading to King Gyanendra's residence, the Narayanhity Royal Palace.
 'This is an important day to end the king's autocracy and restore democracy in Nepal,' Koirala told reporters.
 The parties are demanding the transfer of the executive powers held by the king to a government of political parties which had members in the dissolved parliament.
 The House of Representatives was dissolved in May 2002 for an election in November of that year, but it was not held.
 King Gyanendra, currently on a tour of western parts of the country, said last Sunday he would hand over governance to popular representatives after a parliamentary election.
 He also said he aims at 'initiating' the process of holding a parliamentary election by mid-April 2005.
 Political parties, however, say they anticipate no election can be held in the foreseeable future because the nation is fighting against a communist insurgency.

 Press Statement
 It is already known to everybody that the domestic reactionaries who have been protected by imperialists and expansionists for centuries have been forcing an unjust war - against the desire of Nepali people for peace, independence and change. It is to end this unjust war that has been forced on the people - against their desire for peace - by the old regime that we have been leading the people's just war for the past nine years.  Forget about the old regime's ability to make the people fully sovereign. Its capacity to do has already been made clear by its inability to provide a clear and concrete answer to the six questions we put to remove the serious doubts that the people and the country may have had because of its monotonous ranting about peace and dialogue. The fact that the old regime has been taking more military assistance from imperialists and expansionists, and murdering people and creating terror throughout the country in the name of artificial clashes, shows that it is not geared towards actual dialogue and peace, but instead it is clear that it is using them as bogus propaganda to prepare itself for a vicious war.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 15 Oct 04
It is in this context that our party has declared a halt to all offensive military activities for the traditional Dashain festival, from 4-12 Kartik 20-28 October , to honour the requests by various human rights activists and organizations, civil society and the people.
 Through this statement we call on all the party rank and file, the People's Liberation Army and all other people's party organizations to remain fully alert against any possible treachery, betrayal, dishonesty and ruthlessness of the scheming reactionary regime, and to refrain from carrying out any offensive military activities, but remain in active defence.

The group, carrying portraits of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and placards reading ""Respect human rights in Tibet"" handed over an appeal to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kathmandu.
""This silent march programme was organised to symbolise China's oppression in Tibet and to pay homage to all those who sacrificed their lives for the Tibetan cause,"" said Doma Tsomo, a member of Nepal Tibetan Solidarity Forum.
""We're demanding fundamental human rights including the restoration of cultural and religious freedom in Tibet. The United Nations should act promptly to investigate what is going on inside Tibet,"" Tsomo said.
Nepal has witnessed anti-China protests almost daily since demonstrations in the Tibetan capital Lhasa on March 10, the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule, were followed by rioting four days later.
Police estimated Monday's crowd, who were also carrying candles, at around 3,000 people.
Unlike previous protests, police did not break up the demonstration or detain any protesters.
Sandwiched between India and China, Nepal recognises Beijing's ""One China"" policy that regards Tibet and Taiwan as integral parts of its territory.
Nepalese officials have repeatedly said no anti-China activity will be allowed on its soil as it seeks to preserve friendly ties with the impoverished Himalayan nation's giant northern neighbour.
Nepal is home to about 20,000 exiled Tibetans who began arriving in large numbers in 1959 after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India following the abortive uprising.

Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 9 December
Kathmandu, 8 December: Around 570m rupees will be accrued as arrears from the budget released so for the management of the Maoist fighters.
The arrears are going to accrue as the verification of the combatants living in the seven main cantonments and 21 satellite camps revealed that one-thirds of the fighters were missing. With the reduced count of the number of fighters, the said amount released for the support of the encamped fighters is going to be accounted as arrears.
The first verification carried out by the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) had found that there were a total of 30,852 fighters in the camps. Money for the support of the fighters was being released on the basis of that number. The council of ministers had decided to provide 60 rupees per person per day as support expenditure for the fighters. The Maoist commanders had been receiving the money directly.
The Finance Ministry source said that the government had paid allowances for four months since the government decision of giving 3,000 rupees per fighter per month. After the second round verification of the six camps done by the UMMIN, 15,512 fighters were verified in six camps out of the total of 25,546 fighters.
According to the preliminary report of the UNMIN submitted to the government, 6,807 fighters were not found in the camps. Another 3,627 combatants were disqualified as they were underage. The report states that only 60 per cent of the fighters were qualified. Fourteen per cent of the disqualified fighters will have to leave the camps. The report is silent about the rest of the 26 per cent of the combatants.
Verification is under way at the camp located at Shaktikhor of Chitwan district [in central region]. Based on the report of the UNMIN, the government has estimated that the total number of the Maoist fighters would be approximately 18,000.
""Though the total number of fighters is 18,000, the support budget is being released for 30,852 combatants. Therefore, the amount that went for the missing or disqualified 12,000 will be accounted as arrears,"" said a senior official at the Finance Ministry. The Maoists have presented the details to the government showing that the 30,852 fighters were receiving the allowances.
The arrear amounts that went for the daily allowance of the fighters amounts to 313.3m rupees. Similarly, the arrears in monthly allowances paid to the combatants would total 154.2m.
The advance amount of 461m rupees paid to Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara has not be accounted and verified. Out of this amount, receipts and bills for 71m rupees meant for construction, 14m rupees for purchase of furniture and 40m rupees for administrative spending have not been received.

The activists opened fire when they were stopped by the paramilitary Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which is deployed on the borders with Bhutan and Nepal, at the Bhagwanpur checkpost.
After the clash, the Madhesi activists hid themselves in a house in a nearby village, as the SSB and local police launched a combing operation.
""The operation continued for two and a half hours. We informed the local police of Bhagwanpur as well. They reached on time and helped us in the operation. We recovered a revolver, rupees 36,500 Indian currency and ammunition from them,"" said B.S Walia, Deputy Inspector General, SSB.
The arrested Madhesis have been identified as Ganesh Dhobi, Ramanand Koeri and Vijay Koeri.
""While we were crossing the India-Nepal border, SSB security guards at the border arrested us,"" said Dhobi, an arrested Madhesi.
The Madhesis want greater autonomy for the Terai, Nepal's breadbasket and industrial hub.
The Madhesis have been demanding more positions in parliament, political parties, government and security agencies. They say their community is under-represented by ""political elites"" from Nepal's mountains.
Madhesis say they have been sidelined after a peace pact between the government. Maoist rebels aimed at ending a decade of civil war in which 13,000 people died.

 Dhangadhi far-west Nepal , 26 December: Maoists have held captive a Nepal Television programme presenter, Shivani Singh Tharu. They freed her safely after four days.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 27 Dec 04
She had reached Achham far-west Nepal to conduct research on the condition of conflict-affected women of the area for her Master's Degree thesis. She had been filming the folk life of the local people. She was rescued by Kantipur reporter J. Pandey and brought back into contact with her family.
 Four days after they reached the district, the two journalists were asked by the Maoist government chief Sarad, through a letter, to come to the rebel headquarters at Bhatkatiya. When they followed the order and reached there, Pandey and Shivani were put in undeclared captivity. They were not allowed to meet with anybody.
 The Maoists had threatened Tharu with death, accusing her of being a special police inspector and infiltrating into their area. When Pandey spoke against the charge on behalf of Tharu, he was also threatened.
 Tharu said that she was forced to admit being an inspector. She was freed on condition that she quit the job. They were released on Sunday 26 December after a long ordeal of mental torture.
 When asked about Shivani's affiliation with the Special Police Department, chief of the department Devi Ram Sharma said, ""Kantipur cannot be a proxy for Shivani. If she was in difficulty, her family or the Maoists should have contacted us.""

[By Yang Ming-chu and Sofia Wu]
Tokyo, May 16 (CNA) - A Tibetan activist of Republic of China nationality who was arrested in Japan April 26 for attempting to disrupt the Olympic torch relay in Nagano was released Friday after paying a fine of 500,000 Japanese yen (about US4,899 dollars).
Tashi Tsering, vice chairman of the Taiwan chapter of the Tibetan Youth Congress, was arrested after he attempted to seize the Olympic torch from Ai Fukuhara, a Japanese table tennis player, during the torch's trip through in Nagano in central Japan.
After his release, the 42-year-old Tibetan activist said he felt sorry for breaking Japanese law during the torch relay but believed his move would inspire people around the world to perceive the importance of the Tibetan issue.
Tashi is from a Tibetan family that took refuge in India after China took control of Tibet in the 1950s. He came to Taiwan in the 1990s and has since obtained ROC citizenship.
""I appreciate the Taiwan government's generosity in granting me a passport so that I can live in Taiwan and travel to Nepal, Germany and other countries to take part in pro-Tibet independence activities,"" Tashi told CNA in an interview.
During his detention, Taiwanese officials posted in Japan have visited him and offered legal aid in the judicial proceedings.
Following his release, Ko Se-kai, Taiwan's representative to Japan, met with Tashi to extend his regards and greetings. The Tibetan activist is scheduled to depart Tokyo for Taipei Saturday.

""The seven parties have unanimously decided to boycott the municipal elections,"" said alliance spokesman Arjun Narsingh K.C., who is also a member of the Nepali Congress Party.
""All of the king's actions are unconstitutional, so we are not taking part in any of his activities,"" he said after an alliance meeting on the outskirts of Kathmandu.
The grouping had decided that any member who contests the polls would be expelled from party ranks, he added.
King Gyanendra announced the municipal elections in April after a storm of international criticism over his February 1 seizure of power, which he said was needed to end a bloody Maoist revolt in the impoverished Himalayan country.
The monarch, who has given himself three years to restore democracy, said the polls were part of an effort to ""reactivate the democratic process"".
King Gyanendra said in April he had ordered elections to be held in Nepal's 58 municipalities before mid-April next year. The Nepali calendar year runs from mid-April to mid-April.
Critics of the king's plan to hold muncipal polls said in April it was a ""cosmetic facade to camouflage the lack of democracy"".

The Ram-Janaki temple at Nijgadh town in Bara district south of Kathmandu was completed only a few months ago with financial contributions from locals, who have been enraged by Tuesday night's destruction, the source said.
In the other attack, a bus reserved for Buddhist pilgrims was set on fire when it was returning Tuesday from Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, by Maoist rebels who first ordered devotees to get off, the source said.
None of the Buddhist pilgrims was hurt although the bus was badly burnt.
""We were not told the reason for setting the bus on fire but it could be due to the fact it was used for the transportation of security personnel in the past,"" a commuter said.
In another incident, two rebels were killed in a clash with security forces Tuesday night in the Ghandruk area of western Nepal, the source said.
Security, meanwhile, has been beefed up in important trekking areas used by foreigners in the northwestern Himalayas, such as Dhaulagiri and Annapurna.
Suspected Maoists last week robbed five Belgian trekkers travelling in the area, a security source said.
The Maoist ""people's war"" has claimed more than 8,300 lives since 1996. Violence has surged since the rebels pulled out of a seven-month ceasefire in August.

"6487",20082572,"Title: London mayoral candidate Livingstone on Muslim integration, UK Mideast policy.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: May 2, 2008 Friday
Text of report by Saudi-owned leading pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat website on 1 May
[Report by Manal Lutfi, from London: ""Mayor of London to Al-Sharq al-Awsat: I Do Not Believe in Compulsory Integration of Muslims; British Muslims Ought to Learn from Jews""]
Today Londoners will elect the mayor and the local council of their city. The electorate will choose between the current mayor, Ken Livingstone, who belongs to the Labour Party; the Conservative Party Candidate Boris Johnson, who is a former editor of the right-wing weekly magazine The Spectator, and presenter of a comedy programme on British Television; in addition to the Liberal Democrat Candidate Brian Paddick, and other candidates whose chances of winning are virtually non-existent. The real competition is between Livingstone and Johnson. 
Al-Sharq al-Awsat asked for an interview with Johnson, but his media team declined on the pretext that the candidate ""needs to talk only to Londoners.""
Mayor of London Ken Livingstone considers that there is no relationship between his former and current jobs. Before he was elected as the first mayor in the history of London, when the post was created in 2000, he was a prominent food critic in the Evening Standard newspaper, and was a professional taster of food in a number of the most prominent British restaurants. However, the effects of his old profession are clear in Livingstone's speech; he utters no sentence without using the expression ""kitchen,"" ""taste,"" or ""curry."" When Livingstone talked to Al-Sharq al-Awsat about his vision of London, its status, and its ethnic diversity, he said: Can you imagine London without the diversity of its restaurants, without the curry?
Livingstone completely rejects the claim that London's status as a world capital is deteriorating. He explains that London now is on par in the competition with New York over the place of the first financial capital of the world.
The mayor of London does not need a political party, as his political experience indicates this. In 2000, when he was elected Mayor of London, he was the first person to occupy this post. The post was created eight years ago, when he was dismissed as a member of the Labour Party; nevertheless, he won as an independent candidate against the one supported by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Then he won a second term in 2004; at that time he had joined the Labour Party again.
Today, Londoners vote for the third term in elections whose outcome is not clear until now. Today London is more divided than at any previous time into a heart and extremities. The heart is Central London in which the popularity of ""Red ken,"" which is one of the most well-known nicknames of the mayor because of his left-wing tendency. In this heart reside most of the religious and ethnic minorities from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Arab world. As for the extremities, they are the rural areas outside London in which the London middle class lives, which mostly favour the Conservative Party Candidate Boris Johnson.
For this reason, Livingstone more than anyone else knows the importance of the Muslim vote for his election campaign and for his chances of winning. ""The road to the London Town Hall passes through the Muslim votes,"" because the Muslims in London constitute approximately 10 per cent of the 7.5 million Londoners. Thus, Livingstone has visited a large number of mosques, and met the leaders of the Muslim groups in Britain. Livingston says that he is keen on the political participation of the Muslims in London, because London identity today cannot be separated from the religious and ethnic groups living in it. Despite the restrictions from which some Muslims suffered after the attacks of 7 July 2005, which have put anew the issue of integration and identity to the test, Livingstone explains that he does not want the Muslims or others to be integrated in a way based on erasing their cultural peculiarities.
In an interview conducted by Al-Sharq al-Awsat with Ken Livingstone during his election tour of Brick Lane in the East End of London, he says: ""I do not believe in compulsory integration of the Muslims that means abandoning their religious traditions or culture. What we want is a city in which Muslims can preserve their cultural and religious identity, and engage in the economic and political life of London. I believe that the model we can consider in this context is the Jews. The Jews came to London in the eighties of the 18 Century. Some of them have become completely integrated in the British way of life without ignoring their Jewish roots, but many of them are keen on wearing Jewish clothes, do not marry anyone except Jews, and practice their religious rites. Every Jew chooses the way suitable for him to integrate in Britain. I would like the same thing for the Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs. Every Muslim should be free to choose the way he lives in London. As long as all Muslims vote "

 Presenter Islamic preacher Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi has condemned the acts of abduction and killing by armed men, who are supposedly Muslims, and which lead to the victimiszing of civilians. In a news conference in Doha, Al-Qaradawi said that the perpetrators of such actions harm Islam and the causes of Muslims.
 Al-Qaradawi We wanted to clarify the Islamic position represented by the position of the ummah's Muslim nation scholar, and the World Union of Muslim Scholars on all these issues. This position disavows such actions and their perpetrators. It advises them to fear God for the sake of their religion which has been unjustly branded as a terrorist religion. They should fear God for the sake of their nation which is being harmed in Nepal because of their actions; people in Nepal have burnt mosques, harmed Muslims and burnt Saudi, Qatari and Pakistani airlines there. They also tried to attack the Egyptian Embassy. What brought this on? Those people who claim that they are doing Islam good are in fact harming it.
Al-Jazeera TV, Doha, in Arabic 1335 gmt 9 Sep 04
Presenter In a news conference, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi denied having issued a fatwa sanctioning the killing of US civilians in Iraq. He said that what he had said in this connection is not a religious fatwa because a fatwa has a special context and implications. He added that those who targeted him in the recent campaign are fishing in troubled waters.
 Al-Qaradawi The principle which I endorse and insist on is that killing a civilian who has nothing to do with military affairs is not sanctioned under any circumstance, nor is it sanctioned to abduct or hold him hostage. This is a firm principle, dear brothers. Furthermore, what I had said does not constitute a fatwa. I never mention killing but resistance in my Friday sermon, lectures, Al-Jazeera talk show and books. I never talked about killing. It is up to the judiciary to decide whether a person should be killed. To kill someone, we need a court that would convict that person and declare that he deserves to be killed. My position on these issues is well-known. However, if there are people who want to take a word from here and a word from another context in order to build palaces on sands, they would be fishing in troubled waters or rather making the waters troubled in order to fish in it, saying that Shaykh Al-Qaradawi has issued a fatwa. I have not issued a fatwa.

"4506",20061112,"Title: LATE ADMISSION OF NAXAL THREAT_ BJP.rtf; Date: September 6, 2006 Wednesday 2:16 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI , Sep 06 -- Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary Arun Jaitley on Tuesday charged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with belatedly acknowledging the seriousness of the threat to internal security posed by naxal violence. 
  So far, the magnitude of the problem had been ignored by the United Progressive Alliance that had, in fact, tried to forge alliances with various extreme Left organisations in different States, he added. 
  Mr. Jaitley indicated that the three-day party national executive committee meeting in Dehra Dun from September 7 would focus on internal security, including naxalism and terrorism, and the agrarian crisis that was driving farmers to suicide. 
  He said no political resolution would be adopted as the political situation would be covered by the opening address of party president Rajnath Singh. The Vande Mataram controversy would also figure in Mr. Singh's address. 
  There is a strong view in the BJP that ahead of the Assembly elections in four States early next year, the party should focus strongly on people-oriented bread and butter issues and problems arising out of threats to internal security that directly affected people. Leaders feel that other issues only serve to divert attention. 
  Mr. Jaitley said it was common knowledge that there was a Maoist corridor from Nepal to the heart of India, and as many as 13 States were now in the grip of naxal violence. The nature of the attacks was different from other acts of terrorism in that sometimes ""hordes of people"" participate in them, sometimes successfully taking over police stations, jails, government offices and even entire villages and towns. Naxalism was somewhat controlled in the 1970s, but now it was a major problem, he said. 
  A special session at the executive meet would be devoted to terrorism and the naxal problem, Mr. Jaitley said, noting that, for the first time, Dr. Singh had virtually admitted that intelligence gathering was poor and the naxal problem was in danger of getting out of hand.

 The seven party opposition alliance has termed the government's response to the Maoists' move to go for cease-fire as ""irresponsible"" and ""against peace"". A meeting comprising top leaders of the alliance in Kathmandu on Tuesday [6 September] alleged the government of engaging in a conspiracy of prolonging its life in the pretext of conflict.
Nepalnews.com website, Kathmandu, in English 6 Sep 05
Former prime minister and Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala was not present in the meeting. He is said to be taking rest at his own residence. Koirala had fainted while leading a peaceful pro-democracy rally in Kathmandu after police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The seven party opposition alliance has been organizing demonstrations in Kathmandu for the last few months against the royal takeover.
 The opposition alliance has also decided to send a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, through the UN office system in Kathmandu, saying that the Nepalese monarch or any member of the royal government did not have authority to represent Nepali people in the forthcoming UN General Assembly. ""We have said in the letter that this is an unconstitutional and illegitimate government and hence, has no authority to represent Nepal or the Nepalese at the UN,"" former foreign minister and Nepali Congress leader Dr Ram Sharan Mahat told reporters after the meeting.
 In its delayed response, the government expressed doubt over the sincerity of the Maoists move to observe unilateral cease-fire. The government's spokesman and minister for information and communications, Tanka Dhakal, said Monday that given their past track record, the government could not take their statement at face value. On Saturday, Maoist chairman Prachanda said in a statement that his party had decided to go for unilateral ceasefire keeping in view of Nepali people's desire for peace.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 2 March
Kathmandu, 1 March: The Royal Nepalese Army has been granted the public transmission frequencies for operating FM radios.
The Ministry of Information and Communications on Wednesday [1 March] allotted the 89.6, 96.4, 101.8 and 103.3 megahertz frequencies to the army.
The band of frequencies ranging from 88 to 108 megahertz has been reserved for public radio transmission purposes.
According to International Telecommunications Union regulations, frequencies below 88 megahertz are allocated for security purposes and those above 108 megahertz are reserved for aviation purposes.
Journalists who are in the movement for press freedom have criticized the army's plan to operate FM radios as a government ploy to eliminate radio stations being operated lawfully.
""Operation of FM radios by the army is quite surprising. This is a government design to infringe upon the public transmission frequencies,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri, president of the Federation of the Nepalese Journalists.
The coordinator of the Save the Radio Movement, Raghu Mainali, said that the military use of the universally accepted public frequencies is an autocratic move to hijack people's rights.
""This shows that the rulers give priority to propaganda rather than to the free flow of news,"" Mainali said. The step aims to control the frequencies that belong to the people and to disseminate propaganda, he said.

"7876",20116983,"Title: Need for Rehabilitation Framework.rtf; Date: August 1, 2011 Monday; Text: Nepal, Aug. 1 -- Recent discourses on Nepal's peace process reveal that noble yet ambitious undertaking by then Seven Party Alliance (SPA) and the Maoist Party to bring an end to the decade-long protracted conflict some five years ago has now come to its critical juncture where the parties across the negotiating tables are consolidating themselves on ideological positioning and partisan interests. Critical agenda on the table for logical conclusion of the long-drawn peace endeavor has been the integration and rehabilitation of Maoist army combatants. Rehabilitation of ex-combatants, which demands greater commitment and coordination of much more resources and planning, has been unduly undermined because of the political grandstanding and positioning over much talked about integration complexities; the norms, numbers and modality. 'Secretariat of the Special Committee for Supervision-Integration and Rehabilitation of Maoist Combatants' has not been able to move ahead with its planned survey.
While there appears to be some superficial discussion on the value and content of the rehabilitation packages, any intelligent guess leads toward assumption that rehabilitation will be planned for and initiated at the eleventh hour through an ad-hoc process, unable to meet its intricate complexities and challenges. Learning from established literatures and institutional understanding, rehabilitation (reintegration) is a process by which ex-combatants acquire civilian status and gain sustainable livelihood, employment and income. It essentially is a social and economic process with an open time-frame, primarily taking place in communities at the local level as a part of the general development of a country and a national responsibility, which often necessitates long-term external assistance to the individuals undergoing rehabilitation.
Literatures exemplify that when wars end, armed forces are generally downsized and armed groups disbanded and disarmed, as signs that peace has come; but more importantly because of the daunting costs of maintaining militaries. Rehabilitation of ex-combatants within the purview of broader national recovery strategy from post-conflict situation will undoubtedly underpin the restoration of political stability. If demobilization is poorly implemented, as is evident from the lessons learnt globally and personal observations, former combatants will become a major source of lawlessness, posing in turn a significant obstacle to long run socio-economic recovery and more importantly restoration of the rule of law. It is even more relevant in Nepali context to keep in mind the possibility of the ex-combatants being lured by the mushrooming armed groups. Rehabilitation is definitely time consuming and costly and for that reason is often neglected but it is important to consider that successful outcomes will have significant implication on the sustainability of any peace endeavors and sought after post-conflict peace and prosperity.
Based on the information in the media originating in particular from the Maoist quarter, it appears that the majority in the Maoist Army strive to be considered for integration. Despite the fact that there is an option for voluntary retirement 'Golden Handshake' for combatants not being integrated, studies and researches have shown that a significant number in the PLA, not just the war wounded and disabled, opt for and will need rehabilitation support, the fact corroborated by general understanding that there will be a ceiling as to the number for integration, anything between 5-10,000 and Golden Handshake for all is neither the viable option.
Irrespective of the context in which the rehabilitation of ex-combatants is envisioned, experts and experiences have demonstrated rehabilitation must be seen as a part of political process of consolidating peace and not merely as a technical activity; the need is to tailor the programs to local realities, critical factor being a credible and effective national ownership, leadership and responsibility. Success of any rehabilitation initiative demands accurate identification of target group, criteria and benefits to be offered. Also crucial for meaningful implementation are the importance of adequate sensitization and realistic appraisal of available local and external resources-support in terms of funding and technical capacities.
While the progress in integration and rehabilitation issues continue to be held hostage awaiting higher-level political negotiations making somewhat difficult for planning, it is imperative that concerted efforts are directed toward at least brainstorming over pragmatic national framework if not establishment of an implementing structure. It will not be wrong to advocate that rehabilitation faces more challenges than integration, which already has some form of institutional basis to be built upon, despite its apparent technical complexities.
Whatever the number, at the end of the day, rehabilitation of i"

Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said the two sides remained ""at loggerheads"" over the former rebels' demands for electoral reform and the immediate abolition of the monarchy, which are holding up the progress of the 11-month-old peace process.
A parliament session on Thursday ended with no progress, and officials said a meeting scheduled for Sunday would be delayed for two days to allow time for more closed-door talks.
""We agreed to postpone the session for two days to speed up our discussions with the other political parties leaders to reach a concrete understanding,"" Mahara told AFP.
""We have intensified our talks and we are hopeful of reaching some kind of agreements in those two days,"" he said.
The country's biggest party, the Nepali Congress, has said it will continue to block the demands, arguing that the Maoists are straying from the terms of the landmark peace deal they signed last November to end a decade of civil war.
The party argues that issues like the future of the Himalayan country's unpopular King Gyanendra should only be decided by a nationwide election.
Nepal's second largest party, the Unified Marxist-Leninist communists, said the peace pact was jeopardy.
""If the seven party alliance (the mainstream parties and the Maoists) is divided, the whole peace process will derail and establishment of democratic republic will be impossible,"" senior Unified Marxist-Leninist Amrit Bohara said.
Crucial polls on the country's political future were cancelled last week because of the deepening rift.
The Maoists also stormed out an interim government in mid-September, arguing that the polls -- which were scheduled for November 22 -- were stacked against them because of the electoral system.

 Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 26 July
 The seven party opposition alliance that is opposing the 1 February royal takeover has condemned the decision of the controversial Royal Commission on Corruption Control (RCCC) to jail former premier and Nepali Congress (Democratic) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and NC (D) leader Prakash Man Singh for a period of two years and fine them 90m rupees each.
 ""The RCCC was constituted in an unconstitutional way. The decision of the commission, too, is unconstitutional and politically motivated. Hence, this house condemns and regrets at the said decision,"" said a motion passed unanimously by a ""mock session"" of the parliament Tuesday [26 July] afternoon. Seven opposition parties had convened the ""mock session"" at the Birendra International Convention Centre as part of their on-going peaceful movement against the royal takeover.
Nepalnews.com website, Kathmandu, in English 26 Jul 05
Supporters of the former premier and NC (D) activists clashed with police and chanted anti-monarchy slogans at Pulchowk this afternoon as soon as they learnt about the RCCC verdict. In its unanimous verdict, a three-member panel of the commission, led by its Chairman Bhakta Bahadur Koirala, had sentenced Deuba, Singh and two other officials two years in jail and a fine of 90m rupees each - holding all of them responsible for alleged irregularity while awarding contract of the access tunnel construction of the Melamchi Water Supply Project.
 ""This is a conspiracy and a politically motivated decision,"" Deuba told reporters emerging out of the commission building Tuesday afternoon. ""The decision is aimed at the character assassination of all those politicians who speak out against 1 February royal takeover,"" he added. Responding to another question, Deuba said he could not even imagine that the commission would have awarded him and his colleagues jail sentence without the consent of King Gyanenndra.
 His colleague and former prime minister Prakash Man Singh also challenged the commission's verdict saying that it was biased and politically motivated. ""We will continue our fight politically after consulting our colleagues in the seven-party alliance,"" he added. This is the first time since 1990 that a popularly elected (former) prime minister has been jailed on charges of corruption.
 When asked how he was feeling after being handed down a jail sentence, Deuba said it was nothing new for him. ""I have been jailed several times in the past,"" he recalled. Former minister Singh said to be in jail itself would be the part of the pro-democracy movement. ""The king has made the world laugh by constituting a commission in the 21st century that has been empowered to arrest, prosecute and hand out verdict (on corruption cases),"" said Singh.
 NC (D) workers were equally angry. ""We have got nothing to say with the Commission. It has only followed the directives of the king,"" an NC (D) activist told Nepalnews in Pulchowk on condition of anonymity. Four student activists affiliated to NC (D) were reportedly arrested by police at Putalisadak area Tuesday evening while they were protesting the commission's verdict. Police are yet to confirm the reports of arrest. The NC (D) has said it will continue its protest against what it calls ""illegal detention"" of its leaders. Officials said former premier Deuba and former minister Singh are likely to be sent to central jail within a couple of days

 Kathmandu, 28 July: Gastroenteritis, which has been spreading across Nepal for the past three months, has claimed the lives of more than 300 people. However, the disease is yet to be brought under control in several areas that are most affected.
 Epidemiology And Infectious Disease Control Department has however, put the death toll at 184. Despite gastroenteritis affecting 35 districts, the department says only 29 districts have been affected by the disease.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 29 Jul 04
""Because the information channels through which the department receives information are slow, the number of death appears less,"" a department source said.
 There are also accusations that the department has implemented measures without consulting experts despite the rapid spread of gastroenteritis. ""The department has focused more on the information campaign rather than controlling the spread of the disease,"" one expert said. The disease has affected the western region the most. Cases of gastroenteritis have also surfaces in flood-affected district since Sunday 25 July .
 Meanwhile, Health Minister Ashok Rai on Wednesday telephoned the head of the Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Control Department, Dr Mahendra Bista, and instructed him to dispatch medical teams to Kalikot district immediately, a Health Ministry source said. The minister also asked for regular briefing on the situation in that district.
 According to the department, a total of 14,871 people have been affected by gastroenteritis since the disease first surfaced three months ago. ""Our statistics show that of those affected by the disease, 184 people have died,"" Dr Bista told Kantipur.
 The department has also claimed that it has buffer stocks of medicine in all five development regions to control the outbreak of gastroenteritis. But sources said medicines have not reached the affected area as required. Dr Bista admitted there were difficulties in the mid-western region.
 The department has also claimed that rapid response teams were currently working in areas where the spread of the disease is still out of control. It is thought that the spread of the disease will be brought under control by mid-August. The disease has mostly affected children under the age of 10 and people over 40 years old.
 According to the statistics of the Department, 25 people have died in four village development committees in Baitadi district far west Nepal and nearly 400 people are affected by the disease. The disease has been brought under control in only two village development committees so far.
 Similarly, the disease is yet to be brought under control in several village development committees in Kalikor, Surkhet, Humla,Dolpa, Salyan all mid-west Nepal and Rautahat and Dhanusha districts both in south central Nepal .
 The Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Control Department says the disease will diminish once the cooler season starts. The main reason for the spread of the disease is said to be contaminated water and lack of proper hygiene.

 Excerpt from editorial by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 5 September
 The three-month unilateral cease-fire declared by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) on 3 September is a positive development given the country's political atmosphere. In his statement, chairman of the Maoist party Prachanda said that the objective of the truce is to respect the aspirations of the people for peace and democracy, as well as to erase prevailing misunderstandings about the Maoist campaign.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 5 Sep 05, p8This is the third time the rebels have declared a truce. During the past two cease-fires sporadic incidents of violence were reported.
 The seven political parties currently rallying on the street have welcomed the Maoist move. The government's response is not yet known. Civil society wants to see immediate peace initiatives. The first step for the warring sides is to sit at the negotiating table.
 Bearing in mind past experience, it is natural to be suspicious about the rebels' motives. People have seen the Maoist move as being sensitive to the desires of the people. The Maoists are still sticking to their old position that revival of parliament is not going to resolve the problem. They want everybody to go for the election of a constituent assembly. The roundtable conference seems to have been dropped from their agenda this time around. The bottom line is that the Maoist problem should be solved politically. The Maoists should prove that they are serious about resolving the problem peacefully. [Passage omitted on need for Maoists to be honest.]

"3387",20043966,"Title: Novelty in Congo_ U.N. Investigates a Massacre.rtf; Date: December 24, 2004 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Crime scenes in eastern Congo are not normally cordoned off with yellow police tape. Investigations are almost unheard of. The blood just washes away, children scoop up the shell casings or misplaced machetes, and the witnesses, if there are any, just try to forget.
 But here on an overgrown hilltop that used to be a militia camp, a bamboo fence encloses a dozen sites where mass killings are thought to have taken place. Gathered around the area recently, peering into pits containing human bones, were prosecutors from Congo and from the International Criminal Court intent on bringing justice.
 The mere fact that the killings are being investigated is a rare and welcome development in this lawless region, where massacres have become the order of the day.
 There are countless towns like Ndrele, places where so many unspeakable acts have taken place for so long that most people had lost hope of living a normal life. But United Nations peacekeepers, alarmed by the allegations of atrocities, broke with their normally passive approach in early December and ordered a raid on Ndrele.
 Their forces easily routed the militias and proved, at least for now, that there is no inevitability to the lawlessness here, that it is possible to take back the eastern Congo from the militias, provided there are enough troops to enforce the peace. 
 On a recent afternoon Uyera, a plump grandmother, sat on the side of the main dirt road selling mandro, a fermented drink made of corn. She told how local militias used to stop and gulp down as much as they wanted. When she asked for payment, they scoffed and walked away. 
 Theft was commonplace when the militiamen from the Armed Forces of the Congolese People ran Ndrele. A woman selling fruit says she had to give some to whichever armed man came by. At the end of the day, other guerrillas would insist on a portion of her profits. They called it taxation.
 The men would beat or kill anyone who dared to resist. Rape was a constant danger. One activist, Sofi Aromborac, has a list of 282 girls and women who have been raped over the past two years. ''Even if you were an old woman like me, you could be raped,'' she said.
 Concerned about the rising abuses, United Nations peacekeepers, most from Nepal, surrounded the militia base on the hill overlooking the town in early December and ordered the fighters to surrender. When they refused, the two sides exchanged fire, with the guerrillas eventually breaking through the soldiers' line and retreating.
 It was the largest military engagement involving Congo peacekeepers since they were deployed here in 2000, United Nations officials said. It was followed by a raid on another militia camp 12 miles away, in Mahagi. In that case, the militias retreated even more swiftly.
 The results have been startling. Ndrele has settled into something resembling normalcy. On a recent market day, thousands of people from surrounding villages swarmed into town under the watchful eye of the peacekeepers. One man whose son had been killed by the militia years ago said it was the first time in five years he had dared come to Ndrele. 
 The women in the market said that they were selling more than ever and that, best of all, they no longer had to share their wares and their profits with the militias.
 Besides reassuring residents, the raid instilled fear in the militiamen. More than 100 have come to a disarmament camp that the United Nations set up in September to reintegrate combatants into society. Those who do not come now face the wrath of local residents, who have begun rounding up anyone they regard as a guerrilla. At least 10 have been killed. 
 Mangara Ukethwengu, 20, had been with the militia in Ndrele but decided to give up. As he walked along the road to go to the transit camp, however, residents set upon him with machetes, leaving gashes on his arms, head and groin. 
 ''I can understand why they're angry,'' said Mr. Ukethwengu, who was recovering in a makeshift prison cell at the military base in Mahagi. ''The militia has been hurting them and they wanted to hurt me.''
 Local religious leaders have called on the population to stop the brutality. After all, it is not certain how long the 100 or so Nepalese solders who now patrol Ndrele plan to stay.

    Flood and landslide triggered by torrential rainfall in various parts of Nepal during recent weeks have so far claimed more than  91 lives and affected lives of approximately 235,000 people.
    The annual monsoon rain which began since June this year also  disrupted transportation and electricity supply and destroyed  crops worth millions of U.S. dollars.
    Although the department of meteorology said that monsoon rain  would subside within the next few days, there is still a  heightened risk of increased mortality and morbidity in the days  ahead due to outbreak of communicable diseases and other factors  such as snake bites.
    The rising flood water is increasing the risk of water borne  diseases such as viral fever,typhoid and dysentery.
    ""There is also the ever-present threat of mosquitoes breeding  on stagnant floodwaters and the spread of malaria and encephalitis, "" warned the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS).
    The NRCS surveys indicated that the recent flood have caused  extensive damage in 28 of Nepal's 75 districts,particularly in  seven southern plains districts.
    The National News Agency RSS reported Thursday,more than 34  Village Development Committees and Nepalgunj municipality of Banke district,some 370 km southwest of Kathmandu, have been widely  affected by the incessant rain.
    Nearly 41,000 people of the district have been completely  affected by the downpour and flood, among which 2,311 households  were entirely affected and more than 1,500 families displaced.
    The NRCS said that more than 200 houses have collapsed due to  the incessant rain in Banke district alone.
    Meanwhile,various government and non-government organizations  have launched campaign for relief and rehabilitation measures in  the wake of floods and landslides.
    The Nepali government on Sunday announced to release about 770, 000 U.S. dollars to provide relief package in the disaster-hit  region.
    Similarly,the government of the United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided 50,000 U. S. dollars, through USAID/Nepal, for the local purchase and  transport of emergency relief supplies to save the children.
    The United Nations system in Nepal has also responded rapidly  to the request of the Nepali government for assistance.
    The United Nations Population Fund has provided food and non- food items to 1,000 flood victims while United Nations  International Children's Fund provided emergency supplies  including water purification tablets from some 30,000 people in  flood and landslide affected areas. The UNICEF has also dispatched 6,000 packets of oral rehydration salt through the NRCS to address the onset of diarrhea and dysentery that may arise due to  contamination of water.
    Similarly, the United Nations Mission in Nepal which is working for verification of arms and armies in Nepal has responded to the  government request to make its choppers available to reach the  disaster-hit region.

Maoist Chairman Prachanda says the number of Maoist arms were found to be less in comparison to the number of combatants because the United Nations refused to register weapons like socket bombs and grenades. Arguing that there are many examples in the world where the number of rebels' arms has been found to be less than the number of troops, Prachanda claimed the Maoists have not hidden their weapons.
Speaking at a press conference organized by the Rupandehi District [western Nepal] chapter of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists in Butwal today, Prachanda also rejected government claims that the Maoists did not provide details about how the money provided to the rebels by the government was spent.
We don't know how to commit corruption, Prachanda said.
Prachanda said big elements that want to bring division in society were active and such elements were involved in the minor incidents that have been happening in the country's politics recently, and requested that everyone be aware of such elements. He urged everyone to be united for establishing republicanism and ending feudalism.
Prachanda arrived in Rupandehi on 23 February to address a Maoist mass meeting in Butwal on 24 February.
