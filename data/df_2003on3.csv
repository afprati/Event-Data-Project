"529",20032452,"Title: Nepal extends curfews amid new violence after Maoists end truce.rtf; Date: August 31, 2003 Sunday; Text: Nepal's government extended curfews and deployed armed guards for political leaders as Maoist rebels and soldiers fought two deadly clashes, days after the peace process collapsed, officials said Sunday.
Rebels ambushed an army patrol Sunday at Melarani village in Surkhet district, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, triggering a daylong gunbattle, an army official said.
""Our preliminary reports are that seven Maoists and three soldiers were killed,"" the official said.
He said a similar clash Saturday in the southeastern Udaipur district left two Maoists dead and three soldiers wounded.
Fourteen of Nepal's 75 districts are now under dawn-to-dusk curfew after nine more districts were added Saturday, amid fears the isolated Maoist attacks could give way to nationwide fighting.
""The number of districts coming under curfew is increasing every day and a curfew could even be imposed in the Kathmandu Valley if the Maoists resume their subversive activities,"" home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said.
The Maoists on Wednesday walked out of a seven-month ceasefire and peace talks after the government refused to agree to an assembly to redraft the constitution.
Since their withdrawal from the truce, the rebels have been blamed for a series of assassination bids against prominent political figures, both from the current government and previous ones.
In response, the government has authorised police protection for leading politicians, a member of Nepal's cabinet said.
Armed guards were seen Sunday guarding the Kathmandu offices of Nepal's two largest mainstream political parties, the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist.
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa met at the weekend with top leaders of his National Democratic Party to figure out the government's next move, with some aides urging him to call for a nationwide emergency that would allow security forces more leeway to preempt attacks.
The government has already renewed its classification of the Maoists as a terrorist group, which means rebel leaders could be arrested on sight.
The Maoists were taken off the terrorist list as a goodwill gesture when the ceasefire was reached in January.
Among the assassination bids blamed on the Maoists, an army colonel who was based at the royal palace was shot dead Thursday. One day later, former state minister for home affairs Devendra Raj Kandel was shot five times. Kandel's condition is improving, doctors said.
Last week gunmen ambushed the motorcade of former premier Sher Bahadur Deuba, who had led a crackdown on the rebels in late 2001 and 2002 after an earlier truce collapsed, but he was unhurt.
The Maoist leadership expressed ""sorrow"" over the incident in western Nepal, saying ""spies and security forces,"" not Deuba, were the target.
Suspected rebels also set fire to the ancestral home of Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, who led the government team in three rounds of peace talks, the last of which broke down August 19.
The Maoists launched a ""people's war"" in 1996 aimed at overthrowing the constitutional monarchy. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.

"4377",20066472,"Title: American , Serbian asked to leave Maldives deny fomenting unrest.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: September 12, 2006 Tuesday
Text of report by Sri Lankan-based Maldivian Minivan News website on 12 September
Two foreign nationals were asked to leave the Maldives at the weekend, after officials accused them of ""undermining the national unity"" of the country.
But the men, an American and a Serbian, told Minivan News that they were simply on holiday in the Maldives and dismissed government allegations of wrongdoing.
They said that they had been ""politely asked"" to leave the Maldives by the authorities but stressed that they had not broken any laws and were not charged with any offence.
The men - both experts in non-violent resistance techniques - had been visiting Addu Atoll. They said that whilst on holiday they had ""exchanged ideas"" with opposition activists about how to conduct peaceful protests.
""I am from a country which was in a similar situation to the Maldives,"" said the Serbian man, who asked not to be named. ""I wasn't a member of OTPOR [anti-Milosevic movement], but I did work closely with them.""
""All over the world people are trying to figure out how to change their societies peacefully and without conflict... [ellipsis as published] and that can be a difficult thing to do,"" added the American man.
""In most countries - India, Nepal, Sri Lanka - it's normal for citizens to talk about the problems they face. But in some countries you are not allowed to talk about your problems. So these people need to learn how to work in an atmosphere of fear and how to bring that fear down.""
""If you can reduce fear on both side, then people can come to an agreement,"" the American said.
Controller of Immigration and prominent DRP [ruling party] Majlis [parliament] member Ibrahim Shafiu told Haveeru [Daily] that the decision to ask the men to leave was taken because he had received reports alleging that the men had been briefing a gathering of youngsters in Addu on ''how to face the security forces and continue the recent acts of violence in the atoll''.
""We questioned them after bringing them to Immigrations,"" Shafiu said. ""They agreed that they had met groups of young people and given them such information. A condition for granting a tourist visa is that they could be expelled from the country if they did, or were suspected of doing, anything to undermine national and religious unity in the Maldives,'' he added.
Shafiu claimed that the men would not be subject to a full investigation ""so as not to waste time"".
But the American denied the allegations: ""We never did anything to bring instability into the country. We didn't break any laws. We are not members of OTPOR. We were not deported. We just exchanged ideas with people. A government official explained to us that Maldives is 'a democracy'. Yet, after that meeting we were constantly photographed and then we were politely asked to leave. The government said they were worried we were undermining the stability of the country but they didn't explain how.''
""The situation in the Maldives is very similar to the situation in Serbia before the fall of Milosevic,"" said the Serb. ""We were not advising the people of Addu of anything. But we did exchange ideas with them. I spoke about Serbia, and how we managed to change things through non-violent means.""
The Serb added: ""I said: we wouldn't have referred to the police as 'Golhaa Force' [""Golhaabo"" is a nickname for President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom] because the police are not the guilty ones. They are just doing their job. In Serbia, we did not go after our countrymen, our neighbours or our brothers. Instead, we talked to the police.""
""In Serbia, we never threw rocks at the police. It would have been the wrong thing to do. It's very important not to do that. Why, people may ask: 1) Because you'll lose - the police have all the weapons and training to fight violently; 2) It causes an increase in fear on both sides and makes a solution more difficult; and 3) the general public will not hear your political message, instead they'll just see the violence,"" the Serb continued.
""If one puts themselves in the position of the police, and you see a crowd running towards you throwing stones, you are likely to respond with violence,"" added the American.
""In Serbia, by acting peacefully we changed the behaviour of the police. The police realized that the people didn't want to fight with them - they only wanted things to change. The Serbian police were a very, very aggressive security force but they changed,"" said the Serb.
""In Maldives we saw that the people in the opposition had the energy and foresight to use non-violent methods. They are very patriotic and very proud of their country,"" said the American.

The Patan Appellate Court on Thursday rejected Charles Sobhraj's appeal against the December ruling that found him guilty of killing of a Western tourist in the Nepalese capital Katmandu in 1975, the statement said.
In his appeal, lawyers claimed Sobhraj, 59, was not in the country at the time of the murder.
Judges Krishna Shrestha and Atmaram Bhattarai said evidence presented in the case showed he was in Nepal and was sufficient to prove his guilt, the statement said.
Sobhraj's lawyer in Paris, Isabelle Coutant Peyre, said in a statement that she would ask French authorities to intervene. She also said she would inform the United Nations human rights committee of the decision, which she called ""a new Nepalese violation of all the international principles on judicial matters and fair trials.""
The Frenchman has in the past admitting to killing several Western tourists, and is believed to have killed at least 20 people in Afghanistan, India, Thailand, Turkey, Nepal, Iran and Hong Kong during the 1970s. He denied murder in last year's trial.
Sobhraj was held for two decades in New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar prison accused of murder, but was deported without charge to France in 1997.
He resurfaced in September 2003 in Katmandu, where he was arrested at a luxury casino.
His nickname stems from his reputation for being a talented disguise and escape artist.

 Regarding the revision of the present Nepal-India extradition treaty, government heads of both the countries are going to hold informal discussion in New Delhi.
 Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa is going to New Delhi on Sunday 23 November in course of visiting the SAARC South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries.
Spacetime, Kathmandu, in Nepali 18 Nov 03 p 1A Foreign Ministry source said that apart from SAARC issues, there will be discussion on bilateral problems with India's initiation.
 The source said that the extradition treaty has been placed as the main topic in the Indian agenda presented for bilateral discussion. During the bilateral discussion to be held between Prime Minister Thapa and his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee, along with the extradition treaty, terrorism control, border problems, army patrolling of both countries along the border, dry port operation, and transportation management are other main topics.
 Earlier there have been two foreign minister level talks but no concrete decision has been made on the extradition treaty. The Extradition Treaty Revision and Bilateral Legal Advisory Meeting had ended inclusively as the draft of the meeting contained a few proposals against international norms. Foreign Ministry officials have a suspicion that India wanted a prime minister-level informal discussion to ratify this. Regarding the treaty revision, there has already been agreement on most of the clauses but Nepal has been declining the Indian proposal about extraditing a third country citizen to India. Likewise there has not been agreement on another clause about permitting the security officials of one another's country to carry out investigation and arrest criminals in each other's country.

    The separatists tried to throng the visa office of the Chinese  Embassy beside a street choked with heavy traffic, shouting  anti-China and ""Tibet Independence"" slogans. 
    Nepali police blocked the rally, but some leaders of the  separatists climbed up onto the wall of a nearby cinema,  instigating the others to ignore the police's attempts at  dissuasion. 
    The traffic soon was jammed and the reinforcing traffic  policemen had to evacuate some vehicles on the one-way street. 
    Around 100 Tibetan separatists were detained, Kathmandu Police  Control Center told Xinhua. 
    The detainees are supposed to be released after questioning in  police stations. 
    Tibetan separatists are taking advantage of Nepal, the youngest  republic in the world, at its historic turning point, to carry out  anti-China activities. 
    Although Nepal was declared a republic on May 28 by its  Constituent Assembly, a republican government has yet to be  established. 
    The Nepali government has repeatedly said Tibet is an  inalienable part of China and it will not allow anti-China  activities on its territory. 
    Sarbendra Khanal, Metropolitan Police Range Office chief in  Kathmandu, said in April that Nepali police were simply performing  their duties when assaulted by the Tibetans. 
    Tibetan separatists have staged frequent anti-China protests in  Kathmandu since mid-March. The activities often turned ugly,  leading to disruptions of city traffic and clashes with police  which injured Nepali policemen. 
    Chinese Ambassador Zheng Xianglin said last month that there  were criminal acts of beating and smashing by Tibetan separatists  in Kathmandu against other Tibetans who either refused to take  part in anti-China activities or held different positions from the  separatists.

"2058",20044094,"Title: Maoists exploit vacuum as Nepal political leadership lingers in crisis.rtf; Date: May 28, 2004 Friday; Text: Maoist rebels fighting to turn Nepal into a communist state are exploiting a vacuum as the political leadership lingers in limbo three weeks after the pro-royal prime minister quit, observers say.
The Maoists, who control vast areas of the Himalayan kingdom, have stepped up their calls for strikes, which by stopping normal life demonstrate rebel clout at a time when government influence is tenuous.
""The Maoists and those affiliated with them now have an upper hand with the protests,"" said Madhav Gopal Upadhyay, a veteran pro-democracy activist.
King Gyanendra, who outraged Nepal's major parties by firing the elected government in 2002, opened a dialogue with the opposition after his handpicked premier, Surya Bahadur Thapa, resigned on May 7 under pressure from massive street protests.
But the talks have failed to make headway, and opposition leaders say they will mount new demonstrations.
""With the king unable to reach an agreement with the leaders and appoint a new premier, the movement against him is expected to continue and the Maoists are the ones who will cash in from the uncertain situation,"" Upadhyay said.
The Maoists shut down the Himalayan kingdom from May 18 to 20 in a strike called in part to show solidarity with the opposition demonstrations in Kathmandu.
Pro-Maoist groups have called a series of strikes in regions and by various labour sectors leading up to a new three-day national shutdown set to begin June 10.
One strike that will likely be devastating is due from June 7 to 9 when a Maoist trade union has called on all tourism workers to walk off. Tourism supports 1.25 million jobs in the cash-strapped country of Mount Everest.
The Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimated that the fragile economy suffered 63 million dollars in lost revenue during last month's three-day strike.
Amnesty International on Wednesday accused both the rebels and government of abductions and torture during the insurgency, which has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.
According to press reports, however, the Maoists have quietly maintained contacts with officials close to the king in hopes of negotiating a settlement favourable to them when a new -- and potentially weak -- government emerges.
Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a go-between for the Maoists and the royalist government in talks that broke down last year, declined comment on the reports but said the rebels were ready for a brokered solution.
""The Maoists may opt for a new ceasefire and talks if the government comes forward with sincerity and a willingness to redraft the constitution,"" Tuladhar told AFP.
The government in the failed 2003 talks rejected Maoist demands to call a special assembly that would write a new constitution -- which the rebels believe should end the monarchy and turn the world's only Hindu state into a secular, communist republic.
King Gyanendra has pursued a military crackdown on the Maoists, a more hawkish stance than his brother King Birendra, who was killed with nine other royals in 2001 when the drunken crown prince opened fire at the palace.
The king has accused elected leaders of incompetence at tackling the insurgency.
Analysts said Gyanendra was seeking a leader who would be more effective than the two premiers he has installed but who both quit since he ended elected rule.
""But the king does not want to give up his powers and no self-respecting political party leader wants to dance to the king's tune,"" political analyst Bhaktendra Dhoj Thapa said.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 16 March
[by J. Pandey and Kashiram Dangi]
Liwang (Rolpa) [western Nepal], 15 March: Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist chairman Prachanda on Saturday issued another veiled threat, saying the party's ""war"" would continue if they failed to win a majority in the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) election.
Addressing a Maoist electoral mass meeting at Liwang of Rolpa, the district from where the Maoists started their insurgency, he claimed, however, that it would be a ""peaceful war"".
""Such a war will stop only if we receive a majority in the CA polls,"" he said, addressing the programme which was attended by deputy commanders and other senior commanders of the Maoist 'People's Liberation Army'.
A Maoist hotbed during the armed insurgency, Rolpa on Saturday saw Prachanda's first public address.
""You helped us a good deal during the war,"" he said to locals attending the programme. ""Now, we request you to help us in the election also.""
Prachanda directed his party cadres not to carry out any activities against the election code of conduct. ""As this district is the focal point of all because of its links with the beginnings of the people's war, we should do away with violence and force and influence others through ideas and logic.""
He added: ""If we resort to force during election in Rolpa, many countries like the US can use that in its propaganda against us and conspire on that basis to cancel the poll in other places,"" he said.
Prachanda's public directive comes after the pro-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] weekly Dristi published on Tuesday (11 March) what it claimed was a secret 11-point internal circular issued by the Maoist leadership to YCL [Young Communist League] cadres to adopt all means - including threats, intimidation and violence - to win the election. The Maoists have so far not issued any rebuttal of the news report.
Venting his ire against the Nepali Congress and UML, Prachanda also alleged that the latter were now trying to ""please the US"".
""We tried electoral alliance with the UML in Kathmandu but it aborted due to their snooty attitude and their claim that they would win all the constituencies,"" he said.
Minister for Information and Communications Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Maoist deputy commander Nanda Kishor Pun and other Maoist leaders also addressed the meeting.
Prachanda and his team had come here in a convoy of vehicles from Kathmandu.
Hundreds of locals from almost 20 VDCs [village development committee areas] in the district, after being informed that Prachanda was coming to address the mass meet, gathered at local tundikhel [outdoor arena] to listen to him.

"3219",20044419,"Title: Nepal government frees opposition leaders in sign of resolution to showdown.rtf; Date: May 3, 2004 Monday; Text: Nepal's pro-royal government Monday lifted restrictions on protests against King Gyanendra and released opposition leaders rounded up hours earlier, urging reconciliation to end a month-long showdown.
The olive branch came after at least 28 people were injured in clashes near the royal palace as police fired tear gas at stone-throwing opposition supporters demanding the king restore democratic rule.
""All people should now stop street protests so we can move ahead as we work towards elections by April next year,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters.
The opposition made its own U-turn after the day of violence, saying Girija Prasad Koirala, a three-time prime minister and key opposition leader, was ready for talks with the king, who sacked the elected government in 2002.
""Mr Koirala has agreed to see the king. The meeting will likely take place in the next couple of days,"" said a member of Koirala's Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Himalayan kingdom.
Koirala had been defiant earlier Monday as police took him into custody from his Kathmandu home, vowing to ""continue our movement to restore the people's sovereign rights.""
Thapa said Koirala was released late Monday along with five other opposition leaders detained Monday including Madhav Kumar Nepal, a communist whom the opposition has proposed for prime minister.
Meeting a key opposition demand, the home minister said all restrictions on public assembly would expire Monday.
The government banned protests April 8 saying the gatherings would be infiltrated by Maoist rebels waging a bloody anti-monarchy insurgency in the countryside.
The Maoists have expressed moral support for the protests and Madhav Kumar Nepal has said he met with the rebel leadership in November in a hotel in India to forge a potential alliance against the king.
An official close to the palace said the king, who had accused elected leaders of failing to tackle the Maoist insurgency which was launched in 1996, was ready for a compromise with the opposition.
""The king may be ready to give up his executive powers, although possibly not until new elections are held,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
The king had in late April promised elections by April 2005, infuriating the opposition which demanded the vote be held under a ""neutral"" all-party government.
Opposition leader Nepal had told a rally of 20,000 people Sunday that the opposition demanded the right to select the prime minister. The current premier is royalist Surya Bahadur Thapa, an appointee of the king.
Police also released some 1,500 people rounded up at the protest Monday near Narayanhiti Palace. Demonstration leaders had vowed a stronger campaign against the king after their leaders were taken into custody.
""By arresting our leaders, the distance between the king and the political parties has widened and we will mount our protests with a new vigour,"" Narayan Man Bijukchhe, leader of the Nepal Workers and Peasant Party, told the crowd as police carried him off.
The protest was called to mark the one-year anniversary of the opposition's pledge to oust the royalist government through demonstrations.

    Kathmandu valley holds the tri-ancient capitals of Nepal,  capital Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur, all of which cater a large number of domestic and international tourists.
    ""Although there are no red light areas, flesh trade is  flourishing. According to recent estimates, there are between 4, 000 and 5,000 female sex workers in the Kathmandu valley,"" states  the study conducted by the Daywalka Foundation and Center for  Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities.
    ""Though we have not undertaken any official survey, our  estimates roughly match with this survey figure,"" Senior  Superintendent of Police and chief of the crime branch of the  Metropolitan Police, Upendra Kanta Aryal, said Thursday, adding, "" We have taken action against roughly the same number of female sex workers.""
    According to the report, concentration of traffickers is high  in the valley in general and the capital city in particular. As  the city is the main business and economic hub of the country, the influx of job-seekers and migration of rural youths either for  higher education or employment is very high.
    Poverty, lack of employment opportunities, migration, low- paying jobs and gender discrimination, lack of female education  and lack of awareness are causing girl-trafficking to flourish in  the country, according to the study.
    It also states that the traffickers lure women, children and  men in the name of better opportunities and other attractions and  finally force them into the flesh trade.
    There are four tires of traffickers -- master trafficker,  primary trafficker, secondary trafficker and spotters.
    The master traffickers are the kingpin in the trafficking  hierarchy and control the supply chain.
    The traffickers usually trap girls and women with false  marriage proposals and attractive jobs, says the study. ""The  trafficker or his accomplice projects himself as the potential  bridegroom, convinces the parents and the girl, opts for marriage  rituals and then trafficks the victim.""
    About 7 percent out of the total of 2,210 prisoners serving  jail terms in the Kathmandu valley in cases related to human  trafficking. Most of the imprisoned male traffickers are from  Sindhupalchok, Nuwakot, Dhading and Makawanpur districts, all  neighboring the Kathmandu valley.
    The study also states that poor law enforcement is to blame for rise in these crimes.

The selection of the country's first post-royal head of state would have paved the way for Nepal's Maoists, who hold the most seats in a recently elected assembly but do not have a majority, to form a government.
But no candidate won the 298 votes necessary in a secret ballot in the country's constitutional assembly, according to figures provided by the legislative body.
The candidate with the biggest number was Ram Baran Yadav, who won 283 votes, according to a statement provided by the assembly.
Republican Ramraja Prasad Singh, the candidate backed by the Maoists though not a member of the party, won 270 votes, the statement said.
A third candidate won no votes, leaving the two others to battle it out for the largely ceremonial post again next week in a fresh vote.
""Since no candidate gathered a simple majority for the presidential post, repolling will take place on Monday morning at 8:00 am (0215 GMT),"" Kul Bahadur Gurung, who chairs the assembly, announced late Saturday.
Both candidates who secured votes are ethnic Mahadhesis who hail from the troubled lowland area bordering India known as the Terai, where demands for an autonomous federal state have seen frequent deadly clashes.
Singh, who was arrested two decades ago for throwing small bombs at parliament and the palace as part of an anti-royal protest, was earlier pegged as the favourite by political analysts.
The country has been stuck in political limbo since the assembly, which will write a new constitution for Nepal, sacked unpopular king Gyanendra and abolished the 240-year-old Hindu monarchy in a landmark meeting on May 28.
Interim prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala has since resigned, but with no one in power to accept his resignation, the elderly centrist has lingered on as a weak caretaker.
The three main parties, who are also leading a two-year-old peace process that saw the Maoist rebels lay down their arms after a decade-long struggle for a republic, had hoped to select a president by consensus.
But political infighting led to a falling out and to Saturday's election.
The new president will take over some of the ceremonial duties previously performed by ousted autocratic king Gyanendra.
In the past seven weeks, as arguing continued over the symbolic post, Nepal has been largely ungoverned.
The Nepali fiscal year ended on July 15 without a new budget, although the assembly did approve a supplementary spending bill.
The country has lurched from strike to strike, over fuel prices, wages and working conditions.
But once a president is in place, that will pave the way for the formation of a government headed by a prime minister, most likely Maoist leader Prachanda -- whose group is still classed as a ""terrorist"" organisation by the United States.
""The president will accept the resignation of the (interim) prime minister and then the Maoists can form a government,"" explained Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the Nepali-language news weekly Samay.

Text of report by Radio Nepal on 12 January
[Presenter]: The House committee formed to probe the Belbari murder incident has said that army personnel misused weapons and their uniform to rape and brutally murder Sapna Gurung in Belbari last year. 
A member of the committee, Pari Thapa, said this today during a session of the interim legislature while presenting the probe report. 
[Thapa]: A team of army personnel led by Chief of the Unified Security Base in Belbari Captain Pralhad Thapa Magar [25/4/2006] is reported to have left to lay an ambush [against the then Maoist rebels]. At the same time, several soldiers arrived at Sapna Gurung's home during the night, abducted her to an uninhabited spot and raped her. The incident establishes the fact that the Nepalese army personnel abused their position, weapons and uniforms by brutally murdering Sapna Gurung. 
Another regrettable incident was found to have taken place the next day when locals gathered regarding the incident were haphazardly fired at by local security forces. 
Six people were killed, 10 incapacitated by injuries and 38 received wounds in the shooting. 
Sapna Gurung was abducted, raped and murdered during the incident that took place the first day. The information was collected from those who witnessed, saw and understood the incident and the facts surrounding the incident. 
[Presenter]: The committee has told the government to punish those involved in the incidents according to the law and report to the House. 
The probe committee also concluded that the government should provide compensation and relief packages to the victims of the incidents. 
To guarantee the victims' right to live, their education, health and employment, the government must form a central monitoring agency to oversee the providing of relief and compensation to them, the report recommends. It also recommends a local relief assistance committee for the purpose.

"4871",20065239,"Title: Mediators from Asia's intractable conflicts to talk peacemaking.rtf; Date: November 25, 2006 Saturday 6:36 AM GMT; Text: Mediators who have tried to settle Asia's most intractable conflicts will gather in Singapore Monday for a closed-door ""retreat"" to discuss peacemaking, organizers said.
The Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD Centre) will co-host the three-day meeting with Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), HD Centre said in a statement.
Among those scheduled to attend are government representatives from Sri Lanka, where escalating fighting has claimed thousands of lives in the last year, frustrating peace efforts brokered by Norway.
Norway is also sending a mediator to the Singapore retreat, said Andy Andrea, HD Centre's head of communications.
He said representatives from the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are also to attend.
The MILF has opened peace talks with Manila but they are now deadlocked. Last weekend the two sides exchanged fire on the southern island of Mindanao, breaking a three-year-old truce.
Andrea said governments from Japan, Indonesia, China and Singapore were among the others sending representatives.
Thailand is also to send delegates as deadly violence continues in the Buddhist kingdom's Muslim-majority southern provinces, despite conciliatory moves taken by the government that assumed power after a September military coup against Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
""Twenty of the world's most eminent mediators will meet behind closed doors in Singapore for three days to discuss challenges posed by armed conflicts in Asia, look for peacemaking opportunities and share practical experiences of mediating between warring factions all over the world,"" the HD Centre said in its statement.
Former United States deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage is to give a keynote speech on Monday entitled ""Does the US have the credibility to resolve, and mediate conflict?""
""Asia has become an invaluable source of peacemaking experience and lessons,"" Armitage said ahead of the speech.
""The current climate of terror has clouded global vision on the peaceful resolution of armed conflict, and the implications for future action must be very carefully considered,"" he said. ""People attending this retreat have an important contribution to make.""
The independent Geneva-based HD Centre, established in 1999 as the Henry Dunant Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, aims to prevent human suffering in war.
In 2002 it concluded a ceasefire agreement between separatist rebels and government forces in the Indonesian province of Aceh.
HD Centre says it is involved in trying to promote reconciliation in Myanmar, was engaged in a long-running effort to bring about a negotiated solution to conflict in Nepal, and in the Philippines has engaged the government and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in talks.
The HD Centre, which has been involved in mediation efforts in other parts of the world as well as Asia, has had a regional representative in Singapore since 2004.
It has announced it will open an Asian regional office in the city-state next Wednesday.

 Minister for Agriculture Hom Nath Dahal has said the government has not been able to invite international mediators because the Maoists are unwilling to give up their arms and their politics of violence.
 Speaking to the press in Pokhara today, Minister Dahal said even if there are no talks with the Maoists, elections would have to be held to resolve the Maoists problem because there were no other alternatives. He argued that without elections there would be no administration and that this was the reason why the government was going to hold the elections.

"2091",20044391,"Title: Nepal opposition in huddle as king's deadline to pick PM nears.rtf; Date: May 31, 2004 Monday; Text: Nepal's opposition leaders were in hectic discussions Monday to select a candidate for prime minister as a deadline set by King Gyanendra to resolve a protracted political standoff ticked closer.
The king late Sunday gave political parties until 5:00 pm (1115 GMT) Monday to recommend a prime minister who could fight a Maoist insurgency and bring the opposition into the government for the first time in two years.
The five main parties, whose street protests led the king's handpicked premier Surya Bahadur Thapa to resign on May 7, held separate meetings early Monday and will later hold a joint session.
""They are going to discuss the king's statement and see if they can nominate a candidate,"" senior opposition leader Bharat Mohan Adhikhari said.
The king had infuriated the political establishment in 2002 by firing the elected government for ""incompetence."" He opened a dialogue with the opposition after Thapa's resignation, but without any breakthrough.
Former foreign minister C.P. Bastola, who supports the opposition, said the king likely imposed his deadline because of a visit to Kathmandu planned at the weekend by the new foreign minister of giant neighbour India, Natwar Singh.
""Officially Singh will be here on a religious pilgrimage but it's clear he will also be observing the political situation,"" said Bastola, who has also been Nepal's ambassador to New Delhi.
The palace statement said the candidate for prime minister should be a ""person with a clean image who can form an all-party government, establish peace and initiate a process for elections within the year.""
The king has accused elected leaders of failing to tackle the Maoist insurgency which seeks to overthrow the monarchy. More than 9,500 people have died in fighting since 1996 and the rebels control much of the countryside.
The opposition last year named as its consensus prime ministerial candidate Madhav Kumar Nepal, a communist who was the main opposition leader in the dissolved parliament.
But the rival Nepali Congress party had increasingly called for one of its own to become prime minister and Madhav Kumar Nepal said last week he was ready to renounce the premiership if there was no opposition consensus on him.
The two largest opposition parties are united against the king, but have sharp differences on how to move forward.
Nepal's Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist wants new elections, while the Nepali Congress wants the restoration of parliament, where it held a majority.

This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Holiday Books issue of December 2002. It is meant to suggest some of the high points in this year's fiction and poetry, nonfiction, children's books, mysteries and science fiction. The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings.The complete reviews of these books may be found at nytimes.com/books.
FICTION & POETRY
     ABANDON: A Romance. By Pico Iyer. (Knopf, $24.) A graceful novel whose hero, an English graduate student of Sufi mystical poetry who hopes to uncover that within himself which passeth show, heads first for California and later for Iran, where he and the woman he is traveling with improve their understanding of mystical poetry and of themselves. 
 ALL OVER CREATION. By Ruth Ozeki. (Viking, $24.95.) A sophisticated novel in which dread and hope coexist and the end of nature is envisioned through the impact of genetically modified crops on a potato-growing family and the representatives of pro- and antimodification factions who descend on their Idaho potato farm.
AMERICAN WOMAN. By Susan Choi. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A fictional account of the intersection of the radical activist Wendy Yoshimura with the fugitive Patty Hearst, who appeared to have adopted the values and perspectives of the revolutionaries who kidnapped her in 1974. The revolutionary life, it turns out, is mainly squalor and dulled anxiety; time outwears everything, and rapidly too.
AND NOW YOU CAN GO. By Vendela Vida. (Knopf, $19.95.) A swift, spare first novel of self-discovery whose heroine is the victim of a terrifying crime (but no grave physical damage). She returns to everyday life through a number of low-pressure encounters whose significance is rendered without being raised to the false cosmic.
ANJA THE LIAR. By Thomas Moran. (Riverhead, $25.95.) Moran explores the moral climate of the post-World War II era through characters (Anja, a girl from Krakow who was once a Nazi informer; a German engineer; a murderous woman who ran a Chetnik unit) who, like their nations, have had experiences so extreme there is no prescription for recovery.
ANY HUMAN HEART. By William Boyd. (Knopf, $24.95.) A novel whose hero, a minor British writer and art dealer (and secret agent), becomes a sort of stoic Everyman for the 20th century, meeting almost everyone (Ian Fleming, Picasso, Hemingway, the Duke of Windsor, Virginia Woolf) and traveling to almost everywhere; he has many successes in life, each one closely attended by yet another fall.
BANGKOK 8. By John Burdett. (Knopf, $24.) A talky, entertaining novel set in Thailand about two decades after the Vietnam War, full of cops, crooks and prostitutes; its narrator, a Bangkok police detective and son of a respectable prostitute, solves a locked-door murder not through deduction but by meditation and a sensitivity to reincarnation.
BAY OF SOULS. By Robert Stone. (Houghton Mifflin, $25.) A highly concentrated (for this author), wholly unnerving novel whose hero, an unhappy professor of English specializing in literary ""vitalism,"" becomes desperately involved with an exotically attractive woman who thinks she has lost her soul and hopes to retrieve it in a voodoo rite.
BEST FRIENDS. By Thomas Berger. (Simon & Schuster, $24.) Contemporary life takes another hit in this, the 22nd novel by the author of ""Little Big Man""; its chief characters, in a variation of the eternal triangle, are two well-offmen (one much weller than the other) and one wife, who appears for a long time to be losing a game she is winning.
BLISS. By Ronit Matalon. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) A tense, often stormy novel involving two women in Israel; one, a fury on fire over Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and its own Arab citizens, destroys her family by her near-to-madness conduct; the other, who must go to France to join relatives in mourning, aimlessly waits out her grief.
THE BOOK AGAINST GOD. By James Wood. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Wood, a distinguished British critic interested in the expansive 19th-century novel about big things like literature and faith, has bitten the bullet and written a big-thing novel, his first, which has to do with literature and faith but is also, thank goodness, laden with wit, forceful images and English eccentrics.
THE BOOK OF SALT. By Monique Truong. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A lush, fascinating, expansive first novel about exile, concerning a gay Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris; he Frenchifies their apple pie while observing with an aching heart how much better adapted to expatriation they are than he is.
A BOX OF MATCHES. By Nicholson Baker. (Random House, $19.95.) Baker employs his specialty as a novelist, the exhibition of life where no life seems to be, to explore the consciousness of a man who rises early, lights a fire and sits around in a mindful state every morning till his matches are all spent.
THE BUG. By Ellen Ullman. ("

British official Jeffrey James - accompanied by British ambassador to Nepal Keith Bloomfield - held discussions with India's Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran on Wednesday, spokeswoman Kitty Tawakley said.
She didn't give any details of the talks.
India, Britain and the United States, key allies of Nepal, have been putting pressure on King Gyanendra to restore democracy after his Feb. 1 seizure of power.
The three countries have welcomed the recent lifting of a state of emergency by the king, but urged him to reconcile with his political opponents and further ease restrictions he imposed.
Both India and Britain suspended military aid to Nepal after the takeover, but New Delhi recently showed a willingness to resume arms supplies. Analysts and international rights activists said the lifting of emergency measures by the king was a ploy to revive military aid.
The British Embassy in Katmandu said Thursday there was no change in Britain's decision to resume weapons sales, despite Gyanendra's recent moves that included the release of some adversaries jailed after his power grab.
British military supplies to the Royal Nepalese Army and two joint projects involving reforms to the police department and the prime minister's office remain on hold, said spokesman Mitra Pariyar.
Some 3,000 politicians, student leaders, journalists and rights activists were arrested to prevent any political mobilization against the monarchy after Gyanendra seized power. Hundreds of activists remain in detention, and the king still rules directly without an elected government or parliament.

The blast occurred around 6:30 p.m. in Mainapokhari village of the Dolakha district, about 100 kilometers southeast of Kathmandu, the police said.
They blamed the Maoist rebels for the blast since they usually target police, army and security forces.
The insurgents may have thought the passenger bus was carrying security forces when they laid the mine, they said.
Later, the rebels also blew up another passenger bus in the Dhading district, about 100 km west of the capital, the police said, adding that no one was killed or injured because the rebels had ordered the passengers to get off the bus.
Maoist rebels also murdered a reporter of the Nepalese national news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti in the Sindupalchowk district of eastern Nepal on Sunday, the news agency reported.
Gyanendra Khadka was picked up from a local school while he attended a meeting with school teachers, the agency quoted the district's chief government official Rudra Nath Basyal as saying.
The rebels tied Khadka to a pole on the school's playground and killed him by slitting his throat with a sharp-edged weapon, the official added.
Government forces, meanwhile, waged fierce battles with insurgents in mountainous areas across the kingdom all day Sunday, the government said. The fighting left at least a dozen rebels and seven police and army soldiers dead.
Heavy fighting between government troops and rebels was going on overnight Sunday in the mountainous Rolpa district in midwestern Nepal and Solu at the foot of Mt. Everest.
The rebels have intensified their attacks on police and army positions after abandoning cease-fire and peace talks with the government last month.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal.
More than 8,000 people have been killed in the seven years of fighting between the government's security forces and the rebels.

  Hussain, Maria said, had worked for Chhota Shakeel and was wanted in an extortion case. Both Shinde and Hussain had allegedly gunned down a local politician and a builder in Lucknow in 2006 at the behest of Shakeel, Maria added.
  The motive behind the killing remains a mystery as Feroze Yakub Khan, the former Rehman aide who allegedly paid the three suspects, is absconding. Rehman, who had an international notice issued against him, was arrested in 2006 from Nepal. Maria said Khan supplied the arms to the three men. A cache of arms, including an Italian-made 7.65 mm Beretta pistol, two magazines, three countrymade crude bombs and 150 gm of low-intensity explosive power - was found on Husain at the time of his arrest, the police said. During interrogation, he allegedly confessed to the killing and named his accomplices.

Official sources here today informed that keeping in mind last year's damage, both in terms of loss of human lives and damage to property worth several thousand crores of rupees, the state administration had decided to remain 'fully alert' even before the first monsoon shower hit the state, particularly the northern districts bordering Nepal. Referring to the steps already taken in this regard, the sources said all senior district level officials, including the chief engineers of irrigation department, had been asked to remain present at the flood control rooms round the clock to 'guide and direct' junior level officers to take effective measures like maintaining constant vigilance and undertaking repairs of all river embankments on top priority basis. 
All the flood control rooms have also been equipped with latest communication facilities and walkie-talkies have been provided to the field officers and executive engineers to help them remain in direct contact with the departmental top brass, the sources said. Moreover, they said, from June 15 the control rooms would maintain round-the-clock chart of daily rainfall, the water level in every rain-fed river and other related data to help combat the menace of annual floods. More than 300 people had died and standing crops and property worth about Rs 2,000 crore were damaged during last year's unprecedented flood fury in nine north Bihar districts due to release of huge amount of water from the reservoirs in Nepal.

"1046",20032088,"Title: Call for peace resonates at 13th NAM Summit.rtf; Date: February 24, 2003, Monday; Text: KUALA LUMPUR, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- A deafening call for global peace emanated from the Putra World Trade Center here Monday as leader after leader at the 13th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit pressed for a peaceful resolution to conflicts.
They stood at the rostrum condemning threats of aggression and oppression as the Middle East stood on the brink of a likely US- led attack against Iraq. They also watched in horror at the developments in Palestine.
At the same time, the leaders said Iraq should comply with the United Nations Security Council resolution to destroy Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction to avert war.
Iranian President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami said Tehran opposed the use of force to change any regime in any country. He was referring to the US intention to get rid of President Saddam Hussein.
""The current frightening world atmosphere makes it imperative for the Non-Aligned Movement to opt for a more affirmative approach toward achieving a peaceful world, a far cry from the struggle for independence in the bygone era of the Cold War,"" he said.
Sixty-three Heads of state or government of NAM member countries gathered here Monday morning to open the summit, which will last until Tuesday.  
Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said global security should be sought through nuclear disarmament, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction as well as balanced and progressive conventional disarmament.
She also called on Saddam Hussein to urgently negotiate a win- win settlement that would ""spare the heroic Iraqi people the agonies of a devastating war.""
Agreeing that weapons of mass destruction do need to be eliminated, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said it was essential for Iraq to comply fully with the obligations it had accepted, including disarmament.
""As a fellow member of NAM, this is our sincere advice to Iraq. We also expect that if Iraq fully complies, the sanctions against that country should be lifted,"" he said.  
Touching on terrorism, Vajpayee called for the conclusion of negotiations at the United Nations on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, in an apparent reference to the United States, said the threat of a military action by a powerful country, let alone just to act on the basis of or simply to demonstrate its might or superiority, was clearly a mistake.
""No matter how powerful the country is, that does not give it the right to act unilaterally against the other,"" said the president whose father Sukarno, the first Indonesian president, was among the founders of the 47-year old Non-Aligned Movement.
Noting that many regions of NAM continued to experience conflict, particularly in Africa, Mozambican President Joaquim Alberto Chissano urged all the NAM members and the international community as a whole to lend their unconditional support to those still in conflict to search for peaceful settlement.  
Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the island republic believed that all actions in respect of Iraq by the United States and others should respect international law and resolutions of the Security Council.
""In this crisis, we must not lose sight of the humanitarian aspect. The Iraqi people have suffered enough,"" he said.
Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong called on the United Nations to push back by all means the war for the sake of world peace.
""We also call for an end to power politics, embargo and sanctions against a number of countries, which have, for many years, caused tremendous hardships and sufferings for their people, particularly those imposed against Cuba,"" he said.
Nepalese Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand echoed the sentiments expressed by other NAM leaders by calling for a durable solution to enable Palestine and Israel to live as neighbors within secure and recognized boundaries.
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction had loomed larger while regional conflicts, unilateral tendencies, distrust and intolerance had caused greater friction and instability in various parts of the world.
""Progress towards disarmament has stalled,"" he said, adding that while NAM continued to tackle traditional security issues, it must, at the same time, give equal attention to critical economic and social issues that affect human security and development.
Zambian President Levy Patrick Mwanawasa appealed to the people of Israel and Palestine to return to the negotiating table and revive the peace process.
Formally founded in 1961, the Movement is the largest grouping of developing countries outside the United Nations. Its summit held approximately every three years provides member states with a platform to address diplomatic, economic, developmental and social issues of the day.

"7872",20113120,"Title: Review_ The Glass Menagerie.rtf; Date: June 18, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU, June 18 -- Up for a second and last run this weekend at Patan's Kamalmani Theatre, 'The Glass Menagerie' is a production that is not to be missed.
The play is about a dysfunctional family, abandoned 16 years ago by a husband and father, struggling to survive during a time of economic turmoil.
The desperation of these individuals, and the tension between people who love each other but drive each other to madness, is staged beautifully in this play.
Director Eelum Dixit and cast present a powerful rendition of Tennessee Williams' heart-wrenching classic 'The Glass Menagerie' that holds strong from its melancholy beginning to its tragic end.
Dixit himself is in the role of the play's narrator Tom Wingfield, a writer haunted by the memory of the family that as a younger man he could not help but abandon (as his father did before him).
At the time during which this ""dimly lit memory play"" is set - the Great Depression era of the 1930s American South - Tom is an aspiring poet of 22 who feels trapped in the warehouse job that he holds to support his overbearing mother and fragile sister.
Dixit's rendition of Tom is agonizing. He performs brilliantly the conflicting interests and the perhaps unavoidable escapism of a young man who loves his sister deeply, but who cannot bear the life that would keep him faithful to her.
In the role of Tom's mother Amanda is Riva Thapa, who makes her theatrical debut with this production.
Thapa conveys well the tension between Amanda's flamboyance and her instincts of a survivor. Raised as a member of the American South's plantation aristocracy, Amanda falls on hard times because of the husband she chooses: a man who drinks and gambles, and then abandons her and their children completely.
Amanda feels her family's current situation, compounded by its experience of the Great Depression, as a painful indignity, and schemes and struggles in vain to secure better lives for her children.
Thapa's Amanda flits tempestuously between anger, joyousness and desperation.
While her rapid-fire speech helps conjure Amanda's tiresome and incessant chatter, one sometimes wants for Thapa to slow down, as this may better convince the audience that her words are indeed coming to her in the moment in which they are neurotically spoken.
Shristi Ghimire plays the shy, fragile, and potentially mentally-unstable Laura, who cannot bear to do anything that brings her in contact with unfamiliar people and who lives instead in a dream world populated by the glass animal figurines that she collects.
Ghimire has an incredibly expressive face, body and voice, whether her character is speaking affectionately of her glass collection, is petrified at the idea of facing her high school crush, or is trembling with fear as her mother and brother scream at each other over her head.
The final character in this play is Jim, the childhood crush who appears unwittingly in the Wingfields' living room when Amanda finally convinces Tom to bring home a young man from the factory to meet Laura, hoping that the meeting might develop into a romantic involvement, and then finally the financial security of marriage.
Arpan Sharma as Jim is easy to like but not overwhelmingly charming, and thus befitting of this arbitrary ""emissary from the world of reality"" who has, through no qualities of his own, become an object of obsession for the Wingfields.
Given certain clues in Jim's lines, however, (his power-hungriness; the coarse way in which he speaks of his ex-girlfriend; his declaration that he always spits out his gum when the flavor runs out, implying a similar way with women) one is left feeling that Sharma's character would have benefitted from being played with a bit of a harsh edge.
While Laura's fragility is both emblematic of and dramatizes the Wingfields' precarious situation, and Jim provides the crucial turn to the plot in the penultimate scene, when both Amanda's and Laura's dreams seem to lie shattered like the glass unicorn that he breaks, it is the tension between Amanda and Tom that propels the play forward.
Amanda's constant nagging, her hawkish watch over her children's every move, and the delusional optimism that she smothers them with, make the Wingfield apartment (represented here by a split-level stage) palpably claustrophobic.
As much as does the need to provide for his mother and sister in hard times, this apartment, dominated by an overbearing mother, comprises the ""two by four situation"" in which Tom feels trapped.
The fight scenes between Tom and Amanda are incredibly charged, and the moments of tender understanding that they share are all the more sweet because of the bitter violence of the rest of their interactions.
We are thus able to see in these characters people who care for each other but-given the circumstances, given the people they are, given how insurmountable the tragedy in which they are immersed seems to be-are unable to do what is right by the other.

"588",20032122,"Title: Floods kill 19 more in India , thousands of villagers lose everything.rtf; Date: September 23, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Lightning strikes and heavy rain destroyed homes and killed 19 people in India's largest state in 24 hours, officials said Tuesday, adding to the monsoon misery in which many villagers have lost everything - their homes, livestock and crops.
The deaths took the toll in monsoon flooding across India to at least 872 people since mid-June. Across South Asia, at least 1,517 people have been killed, well over the 1,000 who died last year. At least 193 have died in Bangladesh, while 216 have perished in Nepal. Pakistan has recorded at least 236 deaths.
Rains are tapering off throughout India, but monsoons are expected to continue through Sept. 30 and the downpour has already been the second highest in 100 years, the Indian weather office said.
Two children and a man were killed and three others injured when a wall collapsed on them in Jaunpur, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Lucknow, capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, said government spokesman Dipti Vilas. In Ghazipur, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of Lucknow, three people were electrocuted and two died in a house collapse, she said.
""Reports of house collapses are still pouring in from different parts of the state. Over 25,000 houses are estimated to have been damaged and a population of over (3 million) has been affected in the rains and floods so far,"" Vilas said.
In Bara Banki, 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Lucknow, five people were killed and five others were injured when a two-story building collapsed. The other deaths happened elsewhere in the state.
Uttar Pradesh received heavy rains Monday, with Lucknow recording 41 millimeters (1.6 inches), the state meteorology department said. More rains were expected this week, said R.K. Verma, head of the department.
After Monday's rains, overflowing sewage water entered many residential areas of Lucknow, forcing people to flee.
""Pumps are being used to flush out the sewage water,"" said municipal official R.K. Maheshwari.
Uttar Pradesh has been ravaged by the worst flooding in a decade. More than 3,000 villages have been marooned, relief department officials say. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, taking their cattle, meager rations and some clothes.
For many, the floods have taken all they had.
Sukhai Ram's newly purchased cow, whose milk he planned to sell to pay off a loan, died after a snake slithering in the floodwaters bit the animal.
""It was a thoroughbred cow and as she was to bear a calf next month. I would have paid back the loan I had taken for purchasing her,"" Ram said.
Thousands of people have taken shelter in schools and government buildings.
""We are ruined. We have lost all our belongings - the house, the crop, utensils and even clothes,"" said Madho, who like many Indians uses only one name.

""I got full assurances from them on agreements on the alleviation of poverty, the control of drugs and the control of terrorism,"" Thapa told reporters at Kathmandu airport.

Badri Bahadur Khadka, chief of Health Education and Promotion Section at National Health Education, Information and Communications Centre said the act would come into effect 90 days after the president signs it. He added that the directive would be a major public health initiative on the part of the ministry. Khadka also said the ministry would complete the directive within six months.
""The bill will be a major tool to reduce tobacco related ailments like cancer, heart problems and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases that cause 51 per cent of the deaths in the country,"" said Khadka.
According to MoHP, Nepal collected around Rs 3.77 billion in revenue from tobacco products last year, whereas it spent around Rs 47 billion for treatment of tobacco related diseases. In Nepal, over 25,000 people die every year due to tobacco related diseases.
According to the bill, it is mandatory to allocate 75 per cent of the space on cigarette packs or wrappers for pictorial health warning.
Similarly, only licence holders are allowed to sell tobacco and under-18 children and pregnant women will not be sold such items.
The bill has banned advertisements and publicity campaigns of tobacco products in any media and gathering. It has also banned smoking and tobacco use in public places, work places and public vehicles.
In addition, the bill has provisions of health tax fund from tobacco products and anyone violating the law will be fined Rs 5,000 to Rs 100,000.
Khadka said a pictorial warning would be handed over within six months to the Ministry of Industry, which would coordinate with tobacco companies accordingly.
He said the bill would be more focused on behavioural change rather than punishment.
Nepal signed the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003 and ratified it in November 2006. With the ratification, Nepal will be bound to draft a domestic law restricting production and trade in tobacco products.

"1684",20043148,"Title: Wildlife convention approves African hunting quotas for black rhinos.rtf; Date: October 4, 2004 Monday 11:28 AM GMT; Text: A global summit here tasked with regulating trade in endangered species on Monday permitted Namibia and South Africa to each kill five endangered black rhinos per year, a move conservationists warned could lead to wider abuse.
The move will allow wealthy hunters to kill the endangered rhinos and export them as trophies, such as stuffed animals and heads, which would be banned from being resold.
Both countries told the 13th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that only male black rhinos over 30 years old would be targeted, arguing that aging dominant males often prevented younger males from mating, leading to inbreeding and a population slowdown.
But wildlife groups including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the UK-based Born Free Foundation protested the move, warning that it set a dangerous precedent which paved the way for abuse by poachers.
""This says it's alright for a rich white hunter to shoot a rhino for a trophy but not for a local person to use it as a traditional dagger handle or medicine, and if the law seems unjust it is much harder to enforce,"" Born Free spokesman Ian Redmond told AFP.
""There are already too few rhinos in the wild. In the 1960s there was a population of 65,000 and now we're looking at 3,000 or so black rhinos,"" he said.
Countries including the Central African Republic, Mali and Nepal had pushed both nations to consider exporting the animals instead of killing them, a move supported by activists such as Redmond.
""A better use of those so-called surplus animals would be to begin the re-colonisation of former habitats,"" he said.
The WWF also raised concerns about how money earned from the hunting of South Africa's black rhinos would be spent.
""We are not convinced the money generated from the potential income will benefit local communities,"" the WWF said in a statement released after the decision.
Black rhino numbers fell by up to 90 percent during the 1970s and 1980s according to the WWF, which puts the current African population at about 3,600.
The catastrophic decline was caused almost solely by demand for their horns in Middle Eastern and Asian markets, according to the group.
Namibia's quota was raised from 100 to 250 leopards a year, while South Africa's was doubled to 150.
Both nations also had trophy hunting quotas lifted for leopards, which wildlife groups said was a lesser concern because of their abundant numbers.
Some 1,500 delegates have gathered in the Thai capital to debate 50 changes to the global treaty, including limits on trade in species such as the great white shark, the Irawaddy dolphin, and African and Asian elephants.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 12 June
Pokhara, 12 June: US Ambassador to Nepal James F. Moriarty, in a hard-hitting speech targeting the Maoists, said today the Maoists have not changed their old behaviour even after joining the government.
Speaking at a programme organized by the Community Information Centre in Pokhara today, Moriarty said: ""We were optimistic that the Maoists would change their behaviour after joining the interim government. However, the Maoist parliamentarians continued threatening other parties' parliamentarians, gheraoed [blockaded] speaker and entered the parliament with arms.""
""Pushpa Dahal [Maoist chairman Prachanda] remarks clearly show that they do not like politics of mainstream,"" said Moriarty.
Coming down heavily on the Maoists, Moriarty said: ""Cleaning garbage from a park should not absolve anyone of the crimes of abduction, extortion or physical abuse.""
Moriarty added that Nepal's peace and democracy are in danger as groups including the pro-Maoist Young Communist League (YCL) were continuing abduction, attacks and killings.
He also criticized the activities of the Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha, including seizure of private property and killings. He labelled such activities as criminal. He warned such unruly activities will derail Nepal's peace process if anything derails it rather than by his remarks as accused by some leaders.
Saying that this year will be a revolutionary one for all Nepalis, he said: ""If the election to constituent assembly (CA) was held fairly, it would be a giant step forward for the establishment of peace and democracy in Nepal.""
Moriarty also assured that the US support for the CA polls will continue.
Moriarty said that Maoists' behaviours and the ethnic division they have created were main obstacles to the establishment of sustainable peace, prosperity and democracy in Nepal. He added: ""Maoists have continued recruiting and training children rather than accepting the mainstream politics.""
He further said: ""The [Communist Party of Nepal] CPN-Maoist calls itself a political party. However, Maoists continue donation collection, threatening and abductions with the help of its own army, the YCL.""
He said: ""There is not any difference between the Maoist leadership and YCL. Their activities are similar. Prachanda said the YCL did not attack me in Damak. But they were carrying placards of the YCL.""
In a press release issued by the American Centre in Kathmandu, Moriarty was quoted as highlighting two main obstacles to Nepal's peace, prosperity and democracy; the first being the Maoists' failure to bring their conduct in line with the standards of mainstream political parties in multi-party democracy and the second being ethnic division.
""Pushpa Dahal and the rest of the Maoist leadership have an historic opportunity before the CA election to prove to the Nepali people and the world that their party is really committed to democracy and peace. Maoist assurances that they are peace loving democrats have been proven hollow daily by the violent actions of their cadre. If the Maoist want the people's trust and support, they must win it through democratic competition and free elections - and not through violence,"" Moriarty said.

Crown Prince Dipendra, the 29-year-old heir to the Himalayan kingdom's throne, was blamed for the palace massacre on June 1, 2001.
After shooting his family, the prince, who was allegedly drunk and high on drugs, apparently turned the gun on himself.
Though a palace investigation did not specify a motive for the killings, palace officials have said Dipendra quarreled with his mother over his choice of a bride.
The massacre brought in new King Gyanendra, marking the start of three years of political turmoil that saw a succession of three prime ministers, an increasingly vicious war between the army and Maoist rebels, and almost daily street protests in the capital of this Hindu kingdom.
Nepal has been without a working government for more than three weeks now, and the political parties and the king have not been able to reach an agreement on a new prime minister.
Memorial services were held across the country. People placed flowers on memorials and prayed for the peace of the souls of the slain royals.
In the capital Katmandu, hundreds of people visited the statue of Birendra at a busy intersection despite a transport strike called by communist insurgents. They burned incense while Hindu priests sang holy songs.

 Kathmandu, 27 August: Former chief justice Bishwanath Upadhyaya said that the Royal Palace would be an obstacle for UN mediation to resolve the country's violent conflict. Stressing the need to forge consensus for UN role, Upadhyaya said: ""There are games going on to fuel the conflict and the palace could become an obstacle for solution.""
 Speaking at a programme Friday 27 August in Kathmandu, he said that the Nepalese have not been able to solve the conflict created by themselves, hence UN mediation was necessary. ""Those powerful nations that have been providing us with financial assistance have also shown concerns towards the problem. In such a situation, all forces should unite and solve the problem,"" he said.

Speaking at the same programme, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist) CPN-UML said that the delay in holding peace talks would solidify militarization in the country. Saying that foreign intervention would also increase along with militarization, Madhav Kumar Nepal said: ""If we lose this opportunity to restore peace then we won't be able to stop the country from going to the dogs.

Deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown said there was promising news from Italy and Finland. But he stressed that more European nations are needed for the vanguard force of 3,500 troops that the U.N. wants on the ground by Aug. 28 to help ensure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah militants in south Lebanon.
Italy formally endorsed sending troops to Lebanon but did not commit itself to specific numbers, though Prime Minister Romano Prodi has said the country could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers. Finland formally decided to send up to 250 peacekeepers to Lebanon, but said they would not be deployed until November.
At a meeting of 49 potential troop contributing nations on Thursday, the only countries to offer mechanized infantry battalions, which will be the front line of the expanded force, were three Muslim countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia and Nepal, which is predominantly Hindu.
Many countries said they wanted to study the operational plans for the force and the rules of engagement before making any decisions. They include several European countries Spain, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Portugal and Turkey as well as Morocco, New Zealand and China, U.N. diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed.
Malloch Brown said all potential troop contributors were being sent copies of the concept of operations and rules of engagement so governments could study them over the weekend and decide whether to contribute to the force.
""The core thing that capitals have to get over the hump on ... is that it is not an offensive force, it's not going to go in there and attempt large-scale disarmament"" of Hezbollah fighters, he said.
The United Nations said Thursday it needs 3,500 troops on the ground in 10 days to help the 2,000 U.N. peacekeepers already in Lebanon oversee the deployment of the Lebanese army throughout the south, which Hezbollah controls, and ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.
The U.N. resolution that led to Monday's cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah after a brutal 34-day war authorized up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers to help the 15,000 Lebanese troops extend their authority into the south for the first time. The aim is to create a buffer zone free of Hezbollah fighters between the Litani River and the U.N.-drawn border, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) to the south.
Malloch Brown stressed that the final decision on the composition of the force will be made by the United Nations ""but as a matter of good form in peacekeeping, you want a force which is broadly acceptable in its composition to both sides.""
That's why the United Nations has been seeking ""a Muslim-European or European-Muslim force"" as the core because the combination provides ""a legitimacy that satisfies both sides to this conflict,"" he said.
""We want this force that we deploy to have a kind of multinational, multilateral character so that it enjoys the confidence of both sides,"" he said.
""The particular appeal I want to make today is that Europe comes forward with troops for this first wave,"" Malloch Brown said.
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Dan Gillerman told the AP that ""the resolution makes it very clear that the force will have to be agreed on by Lebanon and Israel.""
""This is a force which the U.N. can compose but not impose,"" he said.
""Israel has not ruled anybody out, and is not in any way ruling out Arab and Muslim countries,"" Gillerman stressed. ""It would, in fact, welcome the participation of Arab and Muslim countries. However, the participation of countries who are hostile to Israel or do not recognize Israel's right to exist would be unthinkable.""
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar, whose country chairs the 56-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, said Israel should have no role in deciding which countries make up the force.
Gillerman noted that Albar was recently quoted as saying that Hezbollah should be rearmed.
""I doubt whether Israel, Lebanon or the Security Council would welcome the participation of soldiers whose mission is to rearm Hezbollah,"" he said.
France, which commands the current 2,000-strong force known as UNIFIL, had been expected to make a significant new contribution that would form the backbone of the expanded force. But French President Jacques Chirac disappointed the United Nations and other countries by announcing Thursday that France would add just 200 combat engineers to its current 200-member contingent in Lebanon.
U.S. President George W. Bush expressed some disappointment Friday with France's decision.

By NEELESH MISRA
Associated Press Writer
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) Nepal's communist rebel chief has issued a roadmap for peace that seeks the release of political prisoners, the dissolution of Parliament and the Constitution and the restructuring of the national army.
Prachanda said in a statement Saturday that he would participate in direct talks with the government after his team of three negotiators carried out a preliminary dialogue.
The roadmap reiterates several of points already agreed between the Maoists and the seven political parties that led a national movement to end King Gyanendra's authoritarian rule last month.
Several of those points including a cease-fire and the naming of peace negotiators have already been accomplished. The others include dissolving Parliament and the Constitution; creating an interim constitution and government, determining voting areas, holding constituent assembly elections under international supervision, and ""restructuring of the state"" to include both the rebels and the royal army.
The new government has promised to try to bring Maoist rebels into the political mainstream after a decade-long insurgency that has killed 13,000 people.
On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli told the AP that he believed Nepal would have a constituent assembly within 12 months and a new constitution by November 2007.
Also Saturday, the government raised concerns that royalist elements might be trying to thwart the gains made after weeks of fierce nationwide protests last month that forced the king to relinquish direct rule.
""We are keeping a close watch on the people who are conspiring against (the) democracy system and the recent changes,"" said Home Minister Krishna Sitaula. ""We will go after these people and not spare them.""
He did not provide further details.
Last week the government ordered the arrest of several former ministers from King Gyanendra's ousted regime, and suspended police and intelligence chiefs. The actions were taken on the recommendation of a judicial commission investigating them and others for allegedly ordering or supporting human rights abuses during last month's demonstrations.
Gyanendra seized power in February 2005 after sacking an interim government, but after weeks of anti-monarchy protests in April, he reinstated Parliament and appointed a prime minister selected by the seven-party alliance.
The new government has matched the rebels' unilateral three-month cease-fire and dropped terrorism charges against the guerrillas. However, sporadic rebel attacks have continued.

 Hyderabad, 14 October: India's two major left extremist groups, Peoples War Group PWG and Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) Thursday 14 October announced they have merged and floated the Communist Party of India (Maoist) outfit, but said the new entity was not ready for a cease-fire.
 The extremists' public announcement came a day before they were to hold discussion with the Andhra Pradesh government, after the government initiated negotiations with them. ""The merger took place on 21 September. We will be going to the talks with our new identity of CPI (Maoists),"" said state secretary of former PWG Ramakrisha in this capital of southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 1739 gmt 14 Oct 04
""Except Andra Pradesh, there is no possibility of talks with any other state government, including West Bengal,"" said Gadai Naskar, central committee member of the newly-formed party, in the eastern metropolis of Kolkata. ""By going to the talks, we are not declaring any cease-fire. It is necessary both for us and the Andhra Pradesh government to talk. We are going to the parleys at the demand of the masses while the government wants us to adopt parliamentary democracy,"" he told newsmen. ""Talks are a part of our tactical line, extremism is not a problem, it is a solution,"" Naskar said.
 Left extremist elements are active along the eastern belt of the country in West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand states, as also in Andhra Pradesh, and have been carrying on armed confrontation with the government for many past years.
 No decision was taken yet on whether Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and Janashakti, the other two groups involved in the talks, would join the new outfit, Ramakrishna said, but added that efforts were on to consolidate all extremist splinter groups on one platform. He said the immediate task would be to build up the ""people's army"" and base areas by intensifying the current ""agrarian revolutionary guerrilla war"" throughout the country.
 For this purpose, he said, it had been decided to convert 14 ""guerrilla zones"" in different districts into ""base areas"", including in Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chattishgarh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Karnataka.
 Naskar said CPI(M) had become a revisionist party after the split of the undivided Communist Party and there was no basis for talks with the Left Front government headed by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in West Bengal.
 Denying there was any Maoist corridor from Dandakaranya to Nepal, Ramakrishna said, ""We are sympathetic to the Maoist struggle in Nepal and condemn the moves of Indian government to send equipment to that country.""
 MCC, which has a strong base in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, would jointly undertake a state-wide mass contact programme to explain the reasons for the merger and hold a public meeting in Hyderabad on 16 November in which leaders from various states will take part.

Belbari, Morang [district in east Nepal]: Chairman of the Communist party of Nepal (Maoist) Prachanda has said as the pro-parliamentary parties now in government are acting on cue from American imperialism and Indian expansionism, there is a danger that the peace talks between the government and the Maoists can fail. [passage omitted] 
Addressing party workers and locals in Rameti VDC [village development committee] of northern Morang district Monday [5 June], Prachanda said, ""Some ministers in the present government are intermediaries of the Americans, and they are working to sideline the Maoists, make the peace talks fail and take credit for themselves only, all on cue from the Americans and Indians."" He accused the pro-parliament parties in the government of lambasting the Maoists out of fear that if constituent assembly polls take place the Maoists will come out on top.
Stating that the seven parties are acting contrary to the spirit of the l2-point understanding with the Maoists, Prachanda said that in order to steal a march on the Maoists they have been breathing artificial life into an already dead parliament and acting pretentiously by taking major decisions. He was of the opinion that the talks will arrive at concrete decisions only after parliament is dissolved, the constitution scraped and an interim government formed. The parties are trying to activate a dead tiger by talking about a ceremonial king, and added that as long as there is no republic there will be no political way out.
If the parties are not ready to accept a republic as per the feelings of the Nepalese people as expressed through the popular movement and the spirit of the people's war, the Maoists are ready to wage war to the end, he pronounced. The Maoists want not just a republic as in India but land reform, ethnic self-determination and special rights for the dalits and women and self-rule under a federal republic, he said. He also claimed that the political parties would become finished if they try to undermine the Maoist movement.
Claiming also that only the name of the Royal Nepalese Army has been changed but not its character, Prachanda said, ""If the present government is ready to respect the feelings of the people let it show this by taking action against [Chief of Army Staff] Pyar Jung Thapa."" [passage omitted] 
Also present on the occasion were Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai, and others. [passage omitted]
Although the cease-fire code of conduct includes a clause that says armed troops will not be present during open public assemblies, the program venue was surrounded by armed Maoist guerrillas.

Text of commentary by Irfan Siddiqui headlined ""Don't say this"" published by Pakistani newspaper Jang 28 July
""Maulana Fazlur Rehman's statement that the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is about to become separate from Pakistan was a shock to the people. Is it true that the anarchy in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA] has reached such a state whereby Pakistan is about to disintegrate? This impression is perhaps not true despite Maulana's pain for the country.""
""There is no doubt in the fact that dictatorship leaves behind itself tremendous deprivations, disappointments, frustration, and despair for the people while saying adieu to the nation. A dictator thinks that he is constructing a spectacular edifice of revolution for the welfare of the people through his rich intellect, unlimited wisdom and enormous patriotism. Flies buzz around him and he starts thinking that he has been sent as a messiah who should lead the nation until he breaths his last. That is why he continues to rule the people for decades while violating every fibre of the constitution and the law. To prolong his rule into eternity, he continues to resort to rabble-rousing. The air starts echoing with his praise that comes from the sycophants but the feeling of loneliness prevails upon him when the dictator loses his teeth or he is forced to step down in disgrace. Only then, it is realized that no problem of the nation was solved. However, a new crop of problems appears in a ripe state. The annals of the history are full of such precedents from Ayub Khan to Parvez Musharraf. The misadventures of dictators have engulfed half of Pakistan. The misadventures did not let the nation harness its collective power. The misadventures did not let the political leadership to mature into a stalwart leadership. The misadventures made the constitution a piece of trash. They alienated the federating units. The misadventure made democracy a spectacle before the world. The misadventure made our dear homeland a haven for the debauched from all over the world.""
""The picture is clear before us. Did we have the kind of challenges before 12 October 1999 that we have today? Were we ever in such a conundrum before 12 October 1999 that we are living in now? President Musharraf is still sitting on the throne but the issues of his dictatorial regime are standing before us like robust snakes. One of the big issues is that the situation of FATA where the anarchy is spreading fast to such an extent that the writ of the state has disappeared. Why do we have this issue and how it has become complicated? Only an independent commission would tell that President Musharraf has been fanning this fire for the last seven years to create a justification to remain in power. The United States meanwhile has been patting his shoulder.""
""War on terror or the policy about FATA has been either at his or the exclusive discretion of the United States. He did not set up an advisory committee or board in this effect. So much so that he did not allow the prime minister, cabinet or parliament that came into being in the aftermath of the 2002 elections to raise questions about these issues. As far as the people were concerned, they were never the priorities of a dictator.""
""The military leadership could not dare to disagree with him because Musharraf was the army chief. Thus, the house of dictatorship had no door or ventilator from where a gust of any reasonable suggestion could have entered. The situation was such that the US officials would come to Islamabad carrying an order from the ""king"" and the dictators in Islamabad would simply implement it. Parvez Musharraf did not consult anyone at the time when the United States ordered him to send the Pakistan Army to the tribal areas. Mohammad Ali Jinnah had declared the tribal people as the ""trusted unpaid soldiers"" of Pakistani borders. Musharraf ignored Jinnah's words and deployed 80,000 soldiers in the tribal areas. Beating his chest with pride, he said: ""It is me who has deployed the army in the tribal areas after 100 years.""
'Today, our 100,000 soldiers are engaged in the tribal areas. Whereas, only a half of this strength consists of the allied forces in Afghanistan from 40 different countries. Our soldiers are guarding 1,000 checkpoints whereas there are only 100 checkpoints on the other side. And yet, we are condemned.""
""We have forgotten a principle i.e. every action has a reaction. There had to be a reaction for the US aggression on Afghanistan. We joined the US forces and became part of this aggression. Therefore, we will have to face a little bit of music. Why were there no suicide attacks earlier? Why were there no attacks against the music shops and barbers' shops? Why were no schools and government installations attacked earlier? Why were there no parallel states earlier? Why was the land of FATA not producing people like Mullah Mohammad, Baitullah Mehsud, Mangla Bagh and Maulvi Omar ear"

Landslides and floods have killed 24 and left seven missing, while lighting killed another 25, said Kumar Poudel, chief of the Natural Calamity Disaster Management Center in Katmandu.
Due to the remoteness of many areas, it has been difficult to get information and send relief supplies, Poudel said. Some villages in this Himalayan kingdom have no roads or communication links, and can only be reached by walking for days.
Bad weather makes it difficult to fly supplies into the mountains.
Monsoons, which started in mid-June, kill hundreds of people in Nepal every year.
Workers are clearing landslide debris blocking a major highway linking Katmandu with other parts of Nepal.
The highway is a crucial link for the capital's residents as it is used to bring essential supplies, including food, from southern cities and adjoining India.

"6751",20083843,"Title: Security Council, US slam Darfur attack.rtf; Date: January 9, 2008 Wednesday 8:39 PM GMT; Text: The UN Security Council and the United States Wednesday slammed a recent attack on a supply convoy of UN-African Union troops in Darfur as a senior UN official said Sudan admitted responsibility for the incident.
Libya's UN envoy Giadalla Ettalhi, the council chair this month, said after consultations on Monday's attack in west Darfur that all 15 members ""made it clear that the attack on UNAMID (the UN-AU peacekeeping force) was unacceptable and must never happen again.""
He added that all members ""expressed their condemnation of any aggression on UNAMID or any other peacekeeping forces.""
""The United States condemns the January 7 attack by the Sudanese Armed Forces on United Nations peacekeepers who were traveling in a supply convoy in Darfur,"" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington.
Saying the attack ""against peacekeepers in white vehicles clearly displaying UN markings is unacceptable,"" he said in a statement that it ""demonstrates the need for a stronger arms embargo for Sudan.""
Jean-Marie Guehenno, head of the UN peacekeeping department, told the  council that a Sudanese area commander had confirmed that ""a Sudanese armed force unit fired upon a clearly marked UNAMID convoy"" in west Darfur.
But earlier Wednesday, Sudan's UN envoy Abdalmahmood Mohamad instead blamed Chad-backed rebels for Monday's attack.
He pointed the finger at Darfur rebels of the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) which he claimed was strongly supported by the Chadian government.
The council was expected to adopt a US-drafted statement formally condemning the attack.
Guehenno said the ""disturbing"" attack showed that the Darfur situation was ""very volatile, very dangerous"" and that ""that we need strong capacities that we do not have.""
UNAMID, which took over from an African Union mission on January 1, did not return fire or sustain troop casualties in the attack, and said it was investigating the incident jointly with Sudan.
""If we had had helicopters capable of flying at night and quickly reinforcing a convoy under attack, of course we would have been in a position  to deter, probably the attack would never have occurred,"" Guehenno said.
He renewed his plea to member states to provide 24 crucial transport and light attack helicopters for UNAMID and for Khartoum to end its apparent foot-dragging in approving key non-African contingents for the force.
The UN official said Khartoum had formally rejected assigning a Scandinavian engineering unit to UNAMID and had yet to approve a Thai infantry battalion and two Nepalese special forces contingents.
Wednesday, Sweden and Norway said they had withdrawn their offer to contribute 400 troops for the Scandinavian engineering unit which was to have helped build up Darfur's infrastructure in the early stages of the mission.
When fully deployed, UNAMID is to become the UN's largest peacekeeping operation with 20,000 troops and 6,000 police and civilian personnel.
But only around 9,000 troops and police are currently in place.
Guehenno also said UN chief Ban Ki-moon discussed technical hurdles with Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir over the weekend and that the two leaders would continue their discussions at the AU summit in Addis Ababa later this month.
The UN official also expressed concern about an upsurge of fighting along the Chad-Sudan border.
""The recent upsurge in fighting in Eastern Chad and West Darfur and the mobilization of JEM and Sudanese forces around Geneina are a cause of grave concern. This sends an extremely negative signal with regards to the prospects for a political settlement to the crisis in Darfur,"" he added.
Monday, Chadian air force planes attacked a Chadian rebel base across the border, southwest of El-Geneina in Darfur, Chadian officials said.
Sudan said Monday that Chadian aircraft had bombed positions in the west of strife-torn Darfur early Sunday, killing and wounding civilians.
The attack followed a threat Saturday by Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno to pursue and strike Chadian rebels inside neighboring Sudan and repeated charges that Khartoum was trying to destabilize his country.
At least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war, famine and diseases and more than two million have fled their homes since the ethnic minority rebels took up arms against Sudan's Arab-dominated regime in February 2003.

"4525",2006924,"Title: India pledges economic assistance to Nepal.rtf; Date: June 7, 2006 Wednesday 1:46 PM GMT; Text: India's prime minister has promised his Nepalese counterpart an economic package to help the new government rebuild the troubled Himalayan country, an Indian official said Wednesday.
The assurance came during talks between Indian premier Manmohan Singh and Nepal's prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala in New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna told reporters.
Koirala outlined Nepal's requirements following months of political turmoil in his country and Singh ""conveyed India's full support within our means for Nepal's economic recovery and reconstruction efforts,"" Sarna said.
""The government of Nepal is in need of political stability and economic recovery and India is committed to that...
""Details of the (economic) package are being worked out. There will be  short terms measures of an immediate nature and long term measures which will be addressed in the package,"" he said.
""The idea is to respond to the needs and priorities of the people of Nepal.""
Another Indian official who did not wish to be identified said the package would be a combination of grants and soft loans worth millions of dollars though media reports put the figure at 22 million dollars.
Koirala, who is seeking aid to restore stability to his troubled nation, arrived in New Delhi Tuesday on a four-day visit, his first foreign trip since taking power in late April after King Gyanendra handed back power to parliament after 14 months of direct rule.
Koirala is accompanied by an 18-member delegation, which includes his finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat and Nepalese business leaders.
Officials said Kathmandu was also likely to ask for India's backing in peace talks with Nepal's Maoist rebels.
New Delhi expressed support for Nepal's political parties during the country's pro-democracy protests, but was also criticised for being too close to King Gyanendra.
Sarna said Nepal had not asked for a resumption of military aid from India suspended after King Gyanendra seized power on February 1 justifying the move as necessary to end a bloody Maoist insurgency that has claimed 12,000 lives since 1996.
""We support the peace efforts of the government of Nepal and the Maoists and we believe that the Maoists must abandon violence and must accept the discipline of multi-party democracy,"" Sarna said.

Donald Camp, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs, arrived in Nepal for a two-day trip and flew directly to Pokhara, a resort town in west Nepal, where the king is vacationing.
Details of the meeting were not immediately available.
The United States has been pressuring the king to initiate dialogue with political parties amid protests against his authoritarian rule.
The monarch seized control of the government on Feb. 1, 2005, a move he said was needed to quell a bloody communist rebellion and bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene.
The country's major political parties have since demanded democracy be restored, but the monarch has conceded little ground instead he has cracked down on protests and opposition politicians.
His refusal to compromise has also sparked an unlikely alliance between the rebels and an alliance of seven major political parties who have vowed to topple Gyanendra's rule.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have fought for a decade to establish a communist Nepal. The insurgency has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.

Releasing a report titled ""Time for Equality at Work,"" the International Labor Organization said most governments worldwide have recognized that discrimination - especially on grounds of race and gender - is a problem that creates barriers to employment.
""Formal condemnation of discrimination is virtually universal, and action to stop discrimination at work has been taken in many places,"" said ILO chief Juan Somavia.
The 136-page study cites decades of lawmaking in North America and Europe and more recent anti-discrimination rules in developing countries such as India or post-apartheid South Africa.
""Still, discrimination remains a constantly evolving 'moving target,' and we have a long way to go on the road to equality,"" said Somavia.
ILO expert Manuela Tomei, the report's main author, told reporters, ""Nobody has been able to measure discrimination directly.""
She said she relied on ""proxies for discrimination,"" like varying income levels of different groups. The report draws on government data and research by the World Bank, anti-discrimination organizations and universities.
ILO said that many individual members of minority groups - black Americans, Australian Aborigines, Gypsies in Europe or people at the bottom of the caste system in India and Nepal - have benefited from affirmative action and other anti-discrimination measures.
Still, when such rules exist, the ILO study says most minority members work in lower-skilled or lower-paid jobs than their majority counterparts - even when both groups have the same level of education. This reinforces assumptions among recruiters, managers and other employees about the jobs minorities are ""best suited"" for.
Governments should do more to ""convince employers that ending discrimination makes good sense,"" said Tomei.
ILO also cited research in the United States which found that firms with affirmative action programs also had more streamlined and efficient recruitment procedures for all their employees.
In many developing countries, job discrimination undermines social and political stability and hits economic growth, said ILO.
Tomei said that discrimination ""acquires more insidious forms"" as countries pass laws to battle its formal side.
In most nations, companies are no longer allowed to state in job advertisements that they refuse applications because of race or gender, Tomei said.
""Advertisements might now ask for people who look good, or have a pleasant appearance,"" she said, noting that these are often code words meant to exclude minorities - and older workers - from the majority.
Women, who currently make up around 67 percent of the world's labor force, are by far the largest group being discriminated against, the report says.
Laws on equal pay have failed to go hand in hand with genuine equality in access to employment.
""No matter the sector, the size of the enterprise or the area of the world, women earn less than men"" because they are more likely than men to work in the lowest-paid and least-secure jobs, said Tomei. Worldwide, they are employed in a narrower range of occupations than men.
In many developing countries they also face barriers to education, land ownership and loans, blocking their economic options.
In rich countries where women are equally or more educated than men, the ""glass ceiling"" often blocks their ultimate rise to the top, the report says.

 He said the government is very committed to establishing peace according to the wishes and hopes of the people, and he said he only hoped that the Maoists would have the courage and the will to understand the sufferings of the Nepalese people and help bring about a permanent peace in the country.

In often short and crisp answers to Bijay Kumar's questions regarding the peace talks between the government and the Maoists, the prime minister said the prospective peace talks would be kept away from the glare of the media, a view which was emphasized by the government's spokesperson, Dr Mohammad Mohsin, after the first meeting of the high-level peace committee last month.
 When asked about the early stages of the Maoist problem, when the Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai had personally met him to put a 40-point agenda to resolve the insurgency, the prime minister said in a solemn voice that he had never expected the Maoist problem to take such a serious turn as it stands today.
 In an answer to a question regarding why the peace process was not moving forward, he said it would make more sense to delay the peace talks than hold a dialogue that was destined to break down.
 Regarding different views being expressed in public by members of the cabinet regarding arrangements for and against a unilateral cease-fire, the prime minister only went on to say the media was not making things any easy as heard , and he refused to express his opinion.

Excerpt from unattributed report headlined: ""Nepal must become federation of nine states, says Maoist woman leader"" by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 29 May
Palpa, 28 May: Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) central member Pampha Bhushal has said that a framework has been prepared for running the country as a federation nine states through the medium of a democratic republic. A federal state is needed for inclusion of all the communities and ethnic groups at all levels in Nepal and for giving them equal rights to governance, women leader Bhushal made it clear.
Addressing a public gathering organized by the Palpa unit of the Maoists at [local] Tundikhel grounds in Tansen [town], central leader Bhushal said the talks which have commenced should be concluded soon and an interim constitution framed through a larger national political conference. After that, parliament, the [present] government and the constitution of 1990 should be scrapped and elections held for a constituent assembly, she said.
Stating that the Maoists would fully adhere to the 25 point code of conduct announced on Friday [26 May], she said that unless constituent assembly elections are held immediately, America could again revive the autocrats. Remarking that the Maoists were compelled to take up arms in the past as their 40 point demand was ignored, she said if the talks now are taken as a sign of weakness, the situation will become frightening.
Addressing the public gathering, Maoist central member and people's liberation army western division deputy commander Janardan Sharma (Prabhakar) said that they would stop raising voluntary taxes and donations from the people if this turns out to be an obstacle to constituent assembly elections. They have come to the peace talks with a framework for turning Nepal into a Switzerland, which was prepared by the party central meeting, he disclosed.
Commander Prabhakar urged Prime Minister Girija Prasad  Koirala to make it public if he is coming under international pressure and pressure from the palace. Explaining the destruction of the historic Palpa palace, the Maoist leader said they were forced to torch the palace as there was a feudal regime inside. [Passage omitted]

"4405",20065373,"Title: Hard work ahead if Nepal 's peace deal is to hold_ analysts.rtf; Date: November 22, 2006 Wednesday 8:22 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebels and central government must continue to make tough compromises if a landmark peace deal ending a decade of civil war has any chance of holding, analysts said Wednesday.
Although seasoned observers agreed Tuesday's peace accord has given the impoverished Himalayan nation good reason to celebrate, most stressed the desperate need to end the climate of political violence.
""The peace deal has begun to heal the wounds that have battered Nepalis over the past decade,"" said Rabindra Khanal, a political science professor from Nepal's Tribhuvan University.
""The two sides need to work closely together to ensure that the upcoming constituent assembly elections are held in a free and fair manner,"" he said.
Organising next year's elections -- in which voters will choose members of a body to rewrite the constitution -- will not be easy as the rebels still control large swathes of countryside, analysts note.
The elected body will also decide the fate of King Gyanendra, whom the Maoists are determined to see the back of. But many mainstream politicians hope he can retain a ceremonial role.
Kapil Shrestha, another politics professor from Tribhuvan University, said issues such as the king and elections will remain thorny.
""The rebels are now part of the political mainstream, and there is no doubt that this is a milestone. Nevertheless, the peace in Nepal totally depends on how the two sides implement the agreement,"" Shrestha said.
Kanak Mani Dixit, editor and publisher of Himal South Asia, a respected English language news magazine, pointed out that the Maoist army -- regardless of their public disavowal of violence -- still had ""many contradictions that they have to deal with"".
""The road ahead will not be rosy,"" cautioned the editor as he nevertheless joined an overnight candle-light celebration in the heart of the city.
""The Maoists... should be given credit for coming this far. What will happen to their militia will be the next step,"" he said.
While the Maoists have agreed to contain their army in camps supervised by the United Nations, there has not yet been any plan on what to do with the unarmed rebel militia, estimated at around 20,000 people.
The Kathmandu Post newspaper also mixed jubilation with caution.
A front page editorial praised the deal and labelled rebel leader Prachanda a ""true hero"", and said aged Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala deserved a Nobel Peace Prize.
But ""the peace accord will be a success only if people feel peace in the air,"" it added.
""There should therefore be no more extortion, abductions, intimidation, torture, disappearings or any other sort of rights abuse,"" wrote Prateek Pradhan, the newspaper's chief editor.
Both sides in Nepal's civil war have been accused of serious human rights abuses, and of the 12,500 fatalities in the war, around half were killed by the army and security services, and half killed by the rebels.

"6438",20073590,"Title: Bhutan holds mock elections in preparation for next year's first-ever vote in isolated kingdom.rtf; Date: May 28, 2007 Monday 8:53 AM GMT; Text: The isolated kingdom of Bhutan took another step toward democracy Monday as voters lined up for the final round of a mock parliamentary election, officials said.
The vote is part of a ""dress rehearsal"" for a 2008 election in Bhutan, part of a remarkable transformation of the 100-year-old monarchy that is changing the world's last Buddhist kingdom into a democracy.
""Observers from the U.N., India and Denmark are monitoring the elections and we expect this final phase of the mock polls to pass off without a hitch,"" said Kunzang Wangdi, Bhutan's Chief Election Commissioner.
Last year, Bhutan's king declared his intention to step down in 2008, allowing national elections and parliamentary democracy. Under the new plan, which becomes effective after next year's vote, the king would become head of state and parliament would have the power to impeach him by a two-thirds vote.
The mock election is between the Druk Yellow party, which promises the ""preservation of Bhutan's culture and tradition,"" and the Druk Red party, which would push ""industry-led development.""
Only 51 percent of the registered voters voted during the mock election's first round of polling on April 21, but authorities hoped Monday's turnout would be larger. Officials said they expected close to 300,000 registered voters to participate out of a population estimated between 700,000 and 2.2 million.
Nepal-based separatists have threatened to carry out bomb attacks in Bhutan during Monday's mock voting, and Bhutanese authorities have deployed soldiers to maintain calm.
Nepalese newspapers have published warnings by the Bhutan Tiger Force (BTF), the armed wing of the Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist), a group formed by Bhutanese refugees currently living in Nepal.
More than 100,000 Nepali-speaking people from southern Bhutan have been living in refugee camps in Nepal after fleeing Bhutan in the early 1990s. They fled after Bhutan launched a crackdown on their anti-monarchy and pro-democracy movement.

"5541",20066731,"Title: Tens of thousands defy curfew and protest on Katmandu 's outskirts.rtf; Date: April 21, 2006 Friday 9:54 AM GMT; Text: Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the outskirts of the Nepalese capital on Friday, again defying a government-imposed curfew a day after security forces opened fire on demonstrators.
An anti-king protester wounded in Thursday's violence died, raising the death toll for that day to four and the overall number of demonstrators killed by security forces during two weeks of often violent street protests to 14.
At least three big rallies were reported Friday on the ring road that circles Katmandu, and which falls within the curfew zone. Hundreds of police backed by armored vehicles and trucks lined the ring road, creating an uneasy standoff.
As the tension grew, an Indian envoy who met with King Gyanendra on Thursday said he expected a ""major announcement"" on Friday that could defuse the situation.
""It is our hope and expectation that perhaps by the end of the day some major announcement will be made,"" Karan Singh told reporters Friday after briefing Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his visit to Nepal.
""We are hoping that there will be some major step toward reinstating democracy,"" Singh said. He gave no other details.
Gyanendra, who seized absolute power 14 months ago claiming it was necessary to defeat a long-running Maoist rebellion, has come under intense pressure to move back toward democracy.
The crisis has escalated steadily since a general strike began two weeks ago and protesters hit the streets daily, leaving the Himalayan country paralyzed and at its most volatile since the king seized power.
On Friday, An Associated Press photographer saw at least 50,000 protesters on the march from the Gangabu area just northeast of the city. Local news media reported tens of thousands were also demonstrating in the Kirtipur area to the south.
They all were headed toward Kalanki, an area on the city's western edge where police fired on protesters Thursday, killing at least three on the spot and wounding dozens more.
About 10,000 protesters were already gathered at Kalanki, where demonstrators had splashed in large red and white letters on the pavement: ""Martyrs' square, long live the martyrs.""
""Long live democracy! The blood of the martyrs will not go to waste,"" protesters chanted, waving political opposition party flags.
Government notices issued early Friday said the 9 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew must be observed in Katmandu, its suburbs of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and in the resort town of Pokhara, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the capital.
The notices warned people to stay indoors during the curfew and said those who violate it will be shot.
They said the curfew was imposed ""to protect the people, property and peace.""
The protester who died at a hospital Friday was among 26 people shot at Gulariya, 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Katmandu, during Thursday's protests.
He was the 14th person killed by fire from security forces since opposition parties launched the general strike on April 6.
A Defense Ministry statement said security forces had to fire on Thursday because the situation was getting out of control.
It said 13 policemen were wounded in clashes with protesters who vandalized government offices and tried but failed to set them on fire.
At the Model Hospital, where many of the wounded protesters including three of those killed were taken, doctors wore black bands to protest the shootings.
""It was terrible,"" said Dr. Sarita Pandey. He said 66 wounded people, eight in critical condition, were brought in Thursday.
He said the injured included a 10-year-old boy with a gunshot wound and 5-year-old beaten by police.
About 100,000 people walked from surrounding villages to march peacefully along the main road that circles Katmandu, littered with bricks and burning tires.
A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to policy, said Friday's curfew was necessary to prevent more violent protests.
Katmandu residents rushed to markets for food and other supplies before the curfew began. Shortages of fresh food and cooking fuel continued due to the general strike.
Notices posted around the city asked government workers to report to work before the curfew began.
Associated Press writer Matthew Rosenberg contributed to this report.

"4811",20063098,"Title: Landmine clearance could head off-track as funding shrinks_ study.rtf; Date: September 13, 2006 Wednesday 9:37 AM GMT; Text: Efforts to clear the landmines that litter the world's past and present conflict zones are under threat because of a funding shortfall, a new report warned on Wednesday.
Landmine use by governments and rebel groups fell in 2005, and more land was cleared of the deadly devices than ever before, said the Landmine Monitor Report.
But finance for mine action declined for the first time, raising the risk that international efforts could head off-track, said the study by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).
""Record demining was reported in 2005,"" said Stuart Maslen of Norwegian People's Aid, who edited the mine clearance section of the report.
""But landmines remain in over 78 countries and seven territories. Global mine action funding will need to be sustained if states are to complete mine clearance in time.""
The ICBL issues regular reports on the global landmine situation and scrutinises the implementation of and compliance with the landmark international mine ban treaty of 1997.
In 2005, deminers cleared more than 740 square kilometres (289 square miles) -- an area the size of New York City, and more than in any other year since major international mine clearance efforts began in the late 1980s.
More than 470,000 landmines were removed and destroyed, said the report.
But the European Commission, United States and eight other major donors decreased their support for mine action in 2005, said the report.
In 2005, global mine action funding totaled 376 million dollars, 23 million dollars less than the previous year.
Funding for clearance programmes fell by around half in Iraq and by a quarter in Afghanistan.
A total of 151 countries have ratified the mine ban treaty, and are due to review progress at a conference next week. Forty countries remain outside it, including China, Russia and the United States.
Some 29 signatory nations still have to meet deadlines to clear all antipersonnel mines on their territory by 2009 or 2010.
Thirteen are not on track to meet this target, including heavily-mined nations such as Bosnia, Cambodia, Mozambique, and Thailand, the study said.
""The longer states take to clear these mines, the longer these mines wait in the ground for innocent civilians to step on,"" said Jody Williams, who spearheaded the anti-landmines campaign in the 1990s and shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize with the ICBL.
Three governments continue to deploy antipersonnel mines, the study said: Myamnar, Nepal and Russia.
In addition, rebel groups in at least 10 countries use antipersonnel mines or mine-like ""improvised explosive devices.'
Reported mine casualties in 2005 were 7,328 -- an increase of 11 percent from 2004 -- including around 2,000 fatalities. Some 80 percent of the victims were civilians.
However, the study said, the recorded figures probably account for only half the real number.
Colombia, with 1,100 victims, had the highest number of recorded casualties.
Up to 500,000 people alive today have survived a landmine explosion and millions more are potential victims because they live in mine-affected areas.
""In addition to overcoming physical and psychological trauma, many survivors also struggle to achieve social acceptance, gain meaningful employment and ensure their rights as disabled people are respected,"" said Katleen Maes of Handicap International, who edited the report's section on victims.
