"1",20022528,"Title: Musharraf, Vajpayee carry enmity to SAARC banquet.rtf; Date: January 4, 2002 Friday 200201041329; Text: The leaders of India and Pakistan, which have massed troops along their borders, put their mutual enmity to public gaze Friday night during a palace dinner hosted for seven South Asian leaders gathering in Nepal for a summit meeting.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India did not shake hands nor did they greet each other during a group photo session prior to the banquet hosted by Nepalese King Gyanendra.
Musharraf and Vajpayee stood on the extreme left and the extreme right of King Gyanendra. After the photo session, Vajapyee looked straight and entered the banquet hall, followed by Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and then Musharraf.
Indian External Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said Friday Vajpayee has no plans to meet bilaterally with Musharraf during the South Asian summit.
'There are no indications of bilateral meetings between India and Pakistan so far,' Rao said.
Rao said it is not that India has closed the doors to talks with Pakistan, 'It is just that the atmosphere is not conducive for bilateral talks.'
She also ruled out bilateral talks at foreign ministers' level between the two countries for the present.
Musharraf told reporters shortly after arriving in Kathmandu on Friday evening that he would not seek a meeting with Vajpayee in the Nepalese capital as 'there can be talk only if there is willingness on the two sides.'
'You cannot have a one-sided dialogue,' he added.
Pakistani presidential spokesman Major Gen. Rashid Qureshi said the seven government leaders will retreat for a few hours Saturday afternoon to a hotel, giving them an opportunity to interact and meet each other on the sidelines of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit.
The duration of the seven-nation summit, originally scheduled to start Friday afternoon, has been reduced from three to two days due to the delay in Musharraf's arrival from Beijing.
Summit sources said Musharraf was originally due in Kathmandu by Friday noon but his flight from China was delayed by fog. He flew to Nepal via China because India has banned Pakistani aircraft flights over its territory as part of measures taken since the Dec. 13 attack on the Indian parliament.
India has accused two Pakistan-based militant groups of staging the attack, and Indian and Pakistan forces have been massing along the so-called Line of Control in the divided territory of Kashmir and along their international border.
SAARC officials said the inaugural session of the 11th SAARC summit has been postponed until 10 a.m. Saturday.
SAARC -- comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- was formed in 1985 to promote regional cooperation and economic development.
The spiraling tension between India and Pakistan is expected to overshadow other issues discussed among the leaders in Kathmandu.
The 11th summit was originally scheduled to be held in Kathmandu in November 1999. But it was postponed at the request of India, which was unwilling then to share the platform with Musharraf, who had taken power in a military coup a few months earlier. The two countries' forces clashed in the Kargil area of the disputed territory of Kashmir that same year.
At the summit, the leaders are expected to approve a report on measures to combat terrorism and sign two conventions -- one on promoting child welfare and the other on cooperation in combating crimes against trafficking of women and children for prostitution.
The summit is expected to yield a pledge to finalize the draft framework for the free trade zone by the end of this year.

Nearby, foreign tourists, their numbers swelling, swim and dine at the posh Cambodiana Hotel, mostly unaware that it once sheltered desperate, starving refugees.
Elsewhere, French colonial buildings boast a fresh coat of paint and potholed streets a new, smooth surface. That's thanks to Cambodia's hosting of what is billed as the largest international gathering in its history.
The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, meets with four key partners - China, Japan, South Korea and India - for a three-day summit beginning Sunday.
Official Cambodia - and others, too - say the event shows the country is taking its place in the international community after nearly three decades of isolation, war and the bloody Khmer Rouge revolution.
""We have to regain our place in the world. What we try to do is reinject into our image Cambodia as a nation of peace, political stability, a tourist destination and an attractive place for foreign investment,"" says Chem Widhya, a senior Foreign Ministry official.
The clash of armed troops was last heard five years ago during a coup by current Prime Minister Hun Sen. Since then, political stability has been largely restored, and the economy saw 7 percent growth in its gross domestic product over the past three years.
More than 700,000 foreigners will have visited Cambodia by the end of the year, compared with 186,000 in 1998. Further increases are expected soon, especially at the temples of Angkor in northwest Cambodia.
The capital of Phnom Penh buzzes, its languid charm replaced by feverish enterprise and a yearning to be globally connected.
There are DJs from Paris, Nepalese curries, American-style fast food and an Australian-run wine bar in the city of more than 1 million people. Private schools teaching computer skills and English are a major industry.
""Cambodia has come a long way in the last decade. Key reforms are being introduced. The foundations of a market-based economy are being put in place,"" says Urooj Malik, who heads operations of the Asian Development Bank in Cambodia.
But there's still a long way to go. Some 36 percent of the country's mostly rural 8.5 million people live on less than $1 a day and a great, potentially dangerous gap exists between Phnom Penh's rich elite and the impoverished villagers. The average Cambodian male dies at 57.
The economy continues to be mostly dependent on foreign aid - about $3.6 billion over the last decade. And while impressive laws and plans for streamlining the government have been set down, corruption, vested interests and a shaky bureaucracy make implementation difficult.
""Cambodia has reached a crossroads - the question now will be enforcement of legislation,"" Malik said. ""Painful decisions need to be made.""
Cambodia lost its once-respected role on the world stage in 1970. That year, the U.S.-backed government began fighting the communist Khmer Rouge, who triumphed five years later and instituted a reign of terror.
A generation of intellectuals and technocrats was decimated and Phnom Penh, once known as the Paris of the East, became a ghost town.
A Vietnamese invasion followed in late 1979, then a civil war. In the early 1990s, the country began its slow groping toward domestic recovery and ties with the outside.
Now, Cambodia, which joined ASEAN in 1999, is seeking greater economic and political integration with its neighbors and hopes to join the World Trade Organization by 2015.
But among the still-teeming poor, the outlook is less rosy and many argue that Cambodia has not yet come of age.
Phol Phea, a 38-year-old farmer who recently came to Phnom Penh looking for odd jobs, said he heard the conference was about cutting down poverty, but he did not expect anything would change for him.
""It is irrelevant to us because we can hardly find rice to eat each day,"" he said.

The elephant, which had killed 12 people since Sunday night, trampled over another villager Tuesday, hours before being shot, officials said.
Amarjit Chauhan had to fire five rounds to bring down the female elephant, in the dense forests of Giridhara in West Bengal state, said Jogesh Burman, the state's wildlife minister. The hunter had scoured the jungles near Nepal for the elephant, he said.
The elephant had several injuries on her back, he added.
""The elephant seemed to have been attacked by poachers. Otherwise she would not have turned so violent,"" he told reporters.
The elephant killed nine people in an Indian border village on Sunday, and three more after crossing over into Nepalese territory. It had apparently come from a forest in Nepal, swimming across a river before reaching the Indian village about 380 miles north of Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal state.
The state government then declared it a ""rogue"" and ordered police and hunters to kill it.

Three of the Maoists were killed by the army in a battle Friday in the western district of Gorkha, while the other died in an exchange of fire with security personnel in Myagdi district.
Defence ministry officials said more Maoists may have died in the encounters.
Fifty Maoists surrendered and 20 more were arrested after the clashes, the sources said.
More than 2,300 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
The rebels broke a four-month ceasefire in November after three rounds of talks with the government failed to yield a breakthrough.

The hashish valued more than 280 million Nepali rupees (about 3. 6 million US dollars) was seized by the police Thursday night from a truck that was involved in a head-on collision with another truck on a high way in Dhadhing district in central Nepal, the radio quoted an unnamed police officer as saying.
""The drugs, compressed by machine and rapped in white plastic wrappings, were packed in 17 sacks concealed in a false bottom of the truck's hood,"" the police officer said, adding that ""The police are searching for the truck driver and his crew who immediately fled the scene of the accident and are still at large. ""
Preliminary investigation into the case suggests that the truck, usually used to carry sand from Dhadhing district to Kathmandu, could have been used before by the anti-government guerrillas to transfer drugs from the surrounding areas to India. Because some documents recovered from the truck reveal that the anti-government guerrillas could have been involved in trying to smuggle the drugs to finance their insurgency, he noted.

""Time has now come for the Nepalese people to face the challenge boldly and unite among themselves to widen the base of mutual confidence and understanding through democratic exercise,"" the king said.
""We should not forget that the Nepalese themselves are the bedrock of any polity and the only catalyst of change,"" he said.
Referring to the six-year insurgency of the Maoists, who want to topple the constitutional monarchy, the king said: ""Continued violence and destruction of development infrastructure in the country have left the Nepalese economy in shambles.""
Gyanendra urged Nepal's political leaders ""to ensure for the people lives of dignity to be lived in peace, security and under good governance.""
The Maoists launched the deadliest offensive of their rebellion Friday, overrunning three police posts in the southwestern district of Dang in clashes that left dead at least 164 people.
More than 3,000 people have died since the start of the Maoist insurgency, more than a third of them since the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire in late November.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said the government ""has placed security matters at the top of its priority list.""
""Rooting out terrorism and maintaining peace is its (the government's) prime responsibility,"" he said in his message for the Nepalese year 2059.
""The Maoists have made the common people's lives miserable, apart from destroying the country's economic infrastructure such as drinking water projects, bridges, power projects and electricity sub-stations.""
Meanwhile, several thousand demonstrators, including actors and other artists, held a march in Kathmandu pleading for peace in the New Year.
They held up placards reading, ""Disturbance and turmoil lead the nation to destruction!"" and ""Peace will lead the country to prosperity!""
Nepal's main parliamentary opposition, the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, Saturday called on Deuba to resume talks with the Maoists unconditionally.
But the government insists the rebels must first lay down their arms.
Three rounds of peace talks between Deuba's government and the Maoists last year ended in stalemate, mostly over rebel demands that the monarchy be scrapped.

"9",20021311,"Title: Floods Disrupt India 's Northeast.rtf; Date: August 15, 2002 Thursday; Text: LAHORIGHAT, India - The flooded Brahmaputra River has cut a vicious swath through India's remote northeast, killing hundreds of people, leveling homes, washing away schools and leaving millions homeless.
Arun Kalita's village, Sootea in Assam state, was swept away, and he now lives with his wife and four children in a tarpaulin-roofed riverbank shelter in this rain-drenched town, depending on government handouts to stave off hunger for himself, his wife and his children.
Kalita is one of the lucky ones - he and his family survived. But he's haunted by the memory of the home he lost.
""We just kept watching from a distance and could do nothing,"" said Kalita, 57, his voice choked with emotion. ""My home now lies on the river bed.""
Annual monsoon flooding has wreaked havoc across South Asia, killing more than 900 people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal since June and displacing or trapping about 25 million more.
Some of the most isolated victims are here in Assam, along the rugged foothills of the Himalayas. At least 39 people have died and nearly a quarter of the state's 26 million residents are now homeless.
After two weeks of destruction, the rains have slowed and the floodwaters have started receding in much of Assam. But the monsoon-driven weather is unpredictable, and officials worry that intense rains could begin again, raising the water level and bringing more flooding.
This is the way it often goes with the monsoons. Intense rains are drenching some parts of South Asia while other regions are slowly drying out and still others - including 12 states in India - are facing one of the worst droughts in years.
In all, monsoon floods have killed at least 323 people in India, according to official estimates.
Another 157 people have died in neighboring Bangladesh. Water levels in the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers, which had receded last week, began rising again Wednesday following fresh downpours in the country's north, officials there said.
But the highest death toll has been in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, where at least 424 people have either been swept away by swirling floodwaters or crushed under mudslides in remote mountain villages.
Relief officials throughout South Asia are now trying to prevent waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and typhoid, which are deadly in impoverished regions.
When the waters come, their destruction is often absolute. In recent days in eastern India, a postman was swept away, a 7-year-old boy drowned and two men died when their boat sank in the Gandak River.
An overflowing river is now threatening to inundate low-lying areas around Patna, the populous capital city of Bihar state, relief officials said Thursday.
In Assam, thousands of stranded people have started returning to their ruined villages, hoping to rebuild their homes and begin their lives afresh.
The monsoon rains last until late September in this part of India, and with the government lacking the resources to build dams, it is flooded nearly every year.
""There is still some hope for those who have their homes intact. But for the families whose homes have been completely washed away by the floodwaters, life will have no meaning unless the government provides land and money,"" said Dandi Nath Saikia, headman of Sootea village.
It's the same story for thousands of villages along the Brahmaputra River, which originates in China's Tibet region as the Tsangpo, flows down nearly 500 miles across the Assam plains and into Bangladesh before spilling into the Bay of Bengal.
For hundreds of thousands of people, the river offers livelihood for six months a year. They earn their livings ferrying people from one village to another in mechanized boats, or trading in vegetables and fish.
But with the monsoon rains, the river becomes a destroyer.
In Boralimari, another Assam village, an elder gestures to a spot covered with a small body of water.
""Look, that is the place where our village high school and junior school stood,"" said Aminul Islam. Now, there is no trace of the buildings.
Mizanur Rahman, a farmer living on a mud embankment in the village of Rowmari, accepts the monsoon misery as part of life.
""I have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""I hate the floods that come almost every year, but I have to live with it.""

"10",20021080,"Title: India seeks to pressure Pakistan at South Asia summit.rtf; Date: January 2, 2002 Wednesday; Text: India was looking to sustain diplomatic pressure on Pakistan as the crisis triggered by a military build-up on their common border moved Wednesday into the multilateral arena at a South Asia regional conference in Nepal.
India's Jaswant Singh flew to Kathmandu for a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from the seven members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), ahead of a full leadership summit beginning Friday.
Shortly after his arrival in the Nepalese capital, Singh offered prayers at a temple dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.
The summit will attract keen international attention given spiralling military tensions on the Indo-Pakistan border, which have seen the two nuclear rivals teeter on the brink of a full-scale war.
The border stand-off followed last month's attack on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi has blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups acting at the behest of Pakistani military intelligence.
While denying any involvement, Islamabad has cracked down on the militant groups identified by New Delhi, and there are hopes that the SAARC meeting will provide an opportunity for both countries to further ease tensions.
India, however, has so far refused to commit to bilateral talks at any level in Kathmandu, insisting that Pakistan must first take further ""counter-terrorist"" measures.
The international community has called on both countries to exercise restraint and analysts say India's opposition to dialogue is aimed at forcing more concessions from Pakistan via pressure from Washington.
India has ensured that terrorism will top the agenda in Kathmandu and will lay out its case against Pakistan as a sponsor of ""cross-border terrorist activity.""
While India has ruled out a one-to-one meeting between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on the summit sidelines, it has left the door open to possible talks at the foreign minister level or below.
""Talks between political leaders below the summit level would be a wise strategy, provided that they do not raise unnecessary expectations or unwarranted rhetoric,"" The Indian Express said in an editorial.
""The politico-diplomatic offensive by India against terrorism requires that now Pakistan has started to take steps against terrorist organisations … we give them time to move further.""
One possible sticking point is a list of 20 wanted ""terrorists and criminals"" India handed to Pakistan this week, demanding they be arrested and extradited.
""This list is very important,"" Home Minister L.K. Advani told AFP on Tuesday, adding that Islamabad needed to ""continue to take vigorous anti-terrorist actions.""
But Pakistan insists that without evidence, it cannot take action against the alleged militants.
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar was quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying Islamabad would consider the extraditions under the SAARC Anti-Terrorism Convention if India takes steps to formally indict the suspects on the list.
The two countries have no bilateral extradition treaty and Sattar described the issue as being legal rather political in nature.
Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes said the crisis was, for the moment at least, being dealt with on the diplomatic rather than the military front.
""Essentially, diplomacy is still working,"" Fernandes said.
But while the neighbours have appeared to be backing away from military conflict, shells have continued to pound both sides of the frontier dividing the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir.
Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged mortar and heavy machine-gun fire in two areas of southern Kashmir overnight Tuesday, but there were no reports of any casualties.
Sattar had complained in Kathmandu on Tuesday that there had been no Indian response to Islamabad's repeated offer of talks at any level.
""There is no indication of any kind of meeting,"" Sattar said.

He also held talks separately with navy chief Madhavendra Singh and the chief of the airforce, S. Krishnaswamy, the defence ministry official said.
""Thapa discussed defence cooperation between the two countries,"" he told AFP.
Earlier in the day, the Nepalese army chief was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour at the defence ministry.
Thapa is in Delhi on the invitation of Padmanabhan, who visited Nepal in May. He was also to meet Defence Minister George Fernandes.
On his arrival here Wednesday at the start of his week-long goodwill visit, Thapa held talks with Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who conferred on him the rank of honorary general.
Also on the agenda are visits to the infantry school at Mhow in central India, the largest and the oldest military training institution in the country, and the famous Balaji temple in southern India.
Though it's being touted as a goodwill visit, defence sources in Kathmandu said Thar was in fact on a buying spree for arms for use against Maoist rebels in Nepal.
He was in particular seeking helicopters fitted with night vision and long range automatic guns.
The Maoist rebels have been using improved and advanced long range guns to attack army and police units, inflicting heavy casualties.
India has been one of the major arms suppliers to Nepal in the past. Some of the weaponry supplied includes two helicopters, self-loading rifles (SLRs), AK-47 assault rifles, armoured cars and long-range guns, defence sources say.
Neither of the two countries has officially revealed details of the deals.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed over 7,300 lives.

The two countries have also agreed to update an extradition treaty, signed in 1953 between New Delhi and Kathmandu, and finalize an agreement for mutual legal assistance,according to a joint statement issued here on Saturday evening at the end of official engagements of visiting Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahardur Deuba.
Deuba, who arrived here Wednesday evening for a six-day state visit, met his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee on Thursday, during which they decided to strengthen cooperation in dealing with the threat posed by terrorism.
The two prime ministers renewed the commitment of the two countries not to allow their respective territories to be used for activities inimical to the interest of the other, the statement said.
The two leaders decided during their ""wide-ranging"" discussions to focus on a ""forward-looking and constructive"" agenda to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
The two sides reiterated their opposition to the use of violence in the pursuit of political or ideological objectives, it added.
The Indian side condemned the widespread attacks by anti- government elements in Nepal and reiterated its support for the steps taken by the Nepalese government to maintain peace and security in the Himalayan Kingdom.
The two sides agreed to hold regular meetings of the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission, headed by the two foreign ministers, to oversee the entire gamut of bilateral relations and provide the directives on measures to further strengthen them.
New Delhi and Kathmandu agreed to expeditiously conclude a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement which would provide a framework for the promotion of Indian investment in Nepal.
The Nepalese side asked India to review various taxes and levies imposed prior to the renewal of the trade treaty early this year.
The two countries also agreed to resolve as early as possible the difficulties faced in Nepalese exports to India of agricultural and primary products because of quarantine regulations in India.
Deuba left for India's east coastal city of Calcutta on Saturday on his way back home.

"18",20021057,"Title: Anti-land mine group_ India , Pakistan lay massive number of mines along border.rtf; Date: September 13, 2002 Friday; Text: India and Pakistan have embarked on a massive land mine-laying operation along their border in Kashmir in possibly the largest deployment of mines in decades, a watchdog group said Friday.
Numerous civilians and soldiers on both sides have been injured by the mines, said the International Campaign to Ban Landmines in its 928-page Landmine Monitor 2002 report.
Indian army officials said in July that mines had been laid across 70,000 hectares (173,000 acres) of the frontier that divides Kashmir between the South Asian rivals as part of a troop buildup in December. Pakistani soldiers also have laid mines.
ICBL said it had evidence that at least six nongovernment groups of fighters also had set mines or improvised explosive devices in the area.
""The mine-laying in India and Pakistan is startling because of the length of the border and the length of the minefields - in some places up to 1 kilometer (2/3 mile) - the density of the minefields and their proximity to villages and farming land,"" Mary Wareham, the report's global coordinator, told reporters.
Although the total number of mines deployed in Kashmir is unknown, more mines were probably laid in the year that started May 2001 than in any year since the report was first published in 1999, said ICBL, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.
The report will be presented next week in Geneva at a meeting of countries that have ratified the 1997 treaty to ban the production, sale and use of land mines.
Wareham said ICBL had urged countries that have signed the treaty to complain to the Indian and Pakistani governments about the mine-laying, but it can do little directly against the two countries as neither has signed the treaty.
ICBL said there was also ""extensive ongoing use"" of anti-personnel mines by the government of Myanmar and by Russian forces in Chechnya, as well as to a lesser extent by Nepal and Somalia. Although Georgia has had a moratorium on use of mines since 1996, the country's forces also apparently laid mines.
On a brighter note, the report said that more than seven million stockpiled mines were destroyed last year, bringing to 34 million the number destroyed since the treaty was negotiated. The number of countries exporting land mines has dropped to 14 from the original number of 55.
The number of land mine accidents also has fallen, to around 15,000-20,000 per year, the report said. ""The long-standing and commonly cited figure of 26,000 new land mine victims each year is no longer valid.""
""Perhaps the most encouraging development noted in this report is the decrease in the number of governments and rebel groups using anti-personnel mines,"" said ICBL ambassador Jody Williams, who shared the Nobel Prize with the organization.
The report said nine governments were reported to have used land mines during the period covered, and two of those - Angola and Sri Lanka - have since declared cease-fires and stopped use. In the previous year there were 13 governments laying mines.
ICBL said it was concerned about Tajikistan - a signatory to the treaty - which has not presented any plans for destroying its stockpile and reportedly has agreed to the use of mines by Russian forces inside Tajikistan.
A total of 125 countries have ratified the land mine treaty, and another 18 have signed it but have not yet ratified. ICBL said more than a dozen governments - including Afghanistan, Greece, Indonesia, Turkey and Yugoslavia - have announced their intention to join soon.
However, the United States, Russia and China are among 50 countries that so far have refused to sign the treaty. China is believed to have a stockpile of 110 million mines, while Russia has 60-70 million and the United States 11.2 million.
On Friday, NATO officials said the alliance had helped to destroy more than 2 million land mines in Albania, Ukraine and Moldovia and plans to destroy more. Of the 19 NATO members, only Turkey and the United States haven't yet signed the land mine treaty.

'Emergency and elections do not go together,' the premier said after returning home from a European trip dedicated to the purchase of arms.
The state of emergency will be lifted, if it is reimposed, after candidates file their nomination papers, Deuba told journalists.
Candidates contesting the election would be given one month for campaigning, he said.
The state of emergency, first imposed last November to battle a raging communist insurgency, ended last Wednesday amid speculation that it will be reinstated.
The premier was away when emergency rule ended.
Deuba said he would decide whether to reinstate the emergency after consultations and taking into account the law and order situation in the country.
Violence still grips the Himalayan kingdom even after nine months under emergency rule.
Communist insurgents have meanwhile carried out bomb blasts, arson and attacks on political workers across the country in the last five days.
The Maoist rebels killed five farmers in the Ramechhap district in eastern Nepal and destroyed by bombing a hydropower plant at Panauti, about 40 kilometers east of the capital, Monday night, government-run Radio Nepal reported Tuesday.
On Deuba's advice, King Gyanendra dissolved parliament in May and announced fresh polls for Nov. 13.
But the rebels, fighting to topple Nepal's multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy, have vowed to disrupt the voting.
Deuba now is under intense pressure to make at least an attempt to reach a truce with the Maoists for the election.

A large number of rebels attacked the district headquarters Sandhikharka around 10 p.m. Sunday, triggering firefights with government forces that lasted four hours, the radio said.
At least 48 policemen and 17 soldiers were killed in the shooting, the report said, quoting government sources in Pokhara in west Nepal.
Government-run Nepal Television, meanwhile, said 59 policemen and soldiers were killed in the rebel attacks.
Government officials in the capital Kathmandu said they were still gathering details on the rebel offensive, adding the death toll could rise given reports of civilian deaths.
The rebels set fire to nearly all the government buildings in the center of the remote district, located about 300 kilometers from Kathmandu.
The rebels also opened fire at two government helicopters trying to land in the area, the state media said.
The TV report said that Maoist rebels also suffered losses in the attacks, but gave no details.
Security reinforcements reached the site Monday morning and are investigating casualties and damage from the attack, police officials said.
Twenty-nine security personnel wounded in the firefights were airlifted to nearby Pokhara and Kathmandu in the morning.
Some 230 security personnel, including 50 regular army troops, were stationed in Sandhikharka at the time of the attack.
'We are still accumulating information about the number of those killed,' a police officer in Kathmandu said on condition of anonymity.
The rebels controlled the district headquarters all night until reinforcements arrived, media reports said.
The rebels carried out attacks on a police outpost in Sindhuli district in southeastern Nepal on Saturday, killing 49 policemen.
The rebels are fighting to abolish the Himalayan kingdom's constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy in favor of a communist republic.

"21",20022127,"Title: Powell arrives in India urging cooling-off with Pakistan.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday he believed tensions had eased considerably between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan and said Washington stood ready to help ""its two friends.""
Powell, who arrived in India on Thursday a day after a visit to Pakistan, said leaders in both the South Asian rivals had indicated they were open to dialogue to ease their monthlong standoff. The two nations have massed hundreds of thousands of troops on their border in their largest buildup since their 1971 war.
Only hours before Powell spoke, however, a bomb blast in a crowded market killed one and injured 15 others in the disputed Kashmir province, which has provoked two wars between India and Pakistan. Indian police blamed Islamic militants for the attack.
India demands Pakistan crack down on militant groups based on its soil and battling India's rule over two-thirds of Kashmir. Tensions have flared since a Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups and Pakistan's spy agency. Pakistan has denied involvement.
Powell met the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, and afterward told reporters that Washington stood ready to help talks between India and Pakistan but would not insist on a role.
""To the extent that we can help bring that dialogue out and to the extent that both sides ask us to assist in that dialogue, the United States is ready to assist its two friends,"" Powell said.
Before his arrival in India, Powell said the situation between India and Pakistan was calmer. ""I don't think it's as dangerous as it was a weekend or two ago,"" he told CBS' ""The Early Show.""
He credited Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for cooling things down with a weekend speech that condemned terrorism and vowed to curb Islamic militants accused of attacks in India.
After meeting the Indian defense minister in Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he believes Musharraf ""is moving within his government to take actions to follow up on the speech.""
""I do not believe it is in either of their interests to stay for a long period in a state of high mobilization,"" Rumsfeld told reporters at a press conference with Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes. Rumsfeld said he was hopeful that ""over the coming weeks or days we will see a relaxation of that tension and some dialogue take place.""
Pakistani police have arrested nearly 2,000 suspected militants since Musharraf said in his speech Saturday that he would not allow militants to conduct terrorist acts in the name of Kashmir.
Musharraf banned the two groups India said was involved in the Parliament attack and three other including Islamic and Kashmiri groups.
On Thursday, police in Pakistan arrested scores of suspected militants in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and sealed dozens more offices of Islamic extremists elsewhere in the country.
India's Singh said he ""welcomed"" Musharraf's speech, but said New Delhi was still waiting for more concrete action on the ground.
""As soon as we see demonstrations of it on the ground, we will respond adequately and quickly,"" Singh said.
In Thursday's bomb blast, the explosive was planted just outside a crowded market in the heart of Jammu, the winter capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state, said the state's police chief Ashok Kumar Suri. He said police suspected Islamic militants were behind the blast.
India accuses Pakistan of fighting a proxy war by funding and arming more than a dozen Islamic militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The 12-year insurgency has cost more than 32,000 lives.
India has demanded that Pakistan hand over 20 men accused of terrorist acts in India. Musharraf said he would never hand over Pakistanis, but left open the possibility that Indians on the list could be extradited.
Powell told reporters that India would provide Pakistan more evidence about the 20 men on the list. ""The more evidence we can provide, the better,"" Powell said.
On Friday, Powell will meet with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his national security adviser before heading to Nepal.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair also made recent visits to Pakistan and India, and the White House said he spoke to President Bush by telephone on Thursday to brief him on the trip.
Earlier Thursday, Powell visited Afghanistan - the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Kabul since Henry Kissinger in 1976 - and pledged support for the post-Taliban administration there and its efforts to rebuild.

"24",20021721,"Title: Ruling party refuses to support extension of emergency rule.rtf; Date: May 22, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Nepal's faction-riddled ruling party refused Wednesday to support a government proposal to extend emergency rule, which lapses Saturday if Parliament doesn't approve the extension into November.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said his party's refusal to support the government had caused a dilemma and was ""a big mistake.""
His Cabinet called a meeting for Thursday morning to decide whether to withdraw the proposal, which was scheduled for debate in Parliament on Thursday.
King Gyanendra imposed the emergency on Nov. 26, suppressing press freedom and giving soldiers and police to detain without charge people suspected of supporting the Maoist rebels who have fought six years to overthrow the constitutional monarchy.
The emergency was declared after the rebels withdrew from stalemated peace talks and resumed attacks on police stations and government targets, such as electricity and telephone connections and political leaders' village homes.
Gyanendra ordered the army to fight for the first time inside Nepal, to aid the ill-equipped police, and the fiercest battles of the insurgency have been reported.
""It was on the request of the security forces who are bravely fighting against the Maoist terrorists that we had decided to seek extension of the emergency. This will do nothing but discourage our forces on the battle grounds,"" Deuba said.
Deuba has the support of only about half of the members of his party, the Nepali Congress. The other half is controlled by his predecessor, Girija Prasad Koirala, who is the party president.
Since the rebels began their violent campaign in 1996, more than 3,500 people have been killed. More than half have died during the past five months as the army began sweeping rebel hide-outs.
The king extended the emergency in February, but a two-thirds vote of Parliament is needed to extend it another six months.
The central working committee of the party decided Wednesday to ask the government to withdraw its proposal to extend the emergency.
""We feel there is no need for emergency rule to control the situation in the country,"" said Arjun Narsingh, spokesman for the party.

""Racial discrimination and untouchability are social crimes we have been involved in for thousand of years and now we must join our hands to fight against it,"" Deuba told a seminar organised by the National Human Rights Commission (HRC) of Nepal.
Deuba said society could not ""proceed on a progressive path"" until both social evils were eroded in the Hindu kingdom.
Untouchables, known as Dalits, are the lowest rung in the Hindu caste system. Although caste was officially abolished in Nepal in the 1960s, lower castes, especially Dalits, still suffer economic and social discrimination.
The HRC said around 35 percent of the 23 million people in Nepal were classified as Dalits.
""Tailors, cobblers and others are traditionally termed as untouchable in the Hindu religion and upper caste people do not even touch them or even let them sit in the same rank despite the fact the constitution has provided equal rights to all people,"" a HRC spokesman said.
Dalits are prevented from entering many Hindu temples in remote parts of the country, while inter-caste marriages are still taboo.
Last year Deuba announced radical social and economic reforms to end inequalities based on caste.
Two bills on the welfare of Dalits and the establishment of a Dalit Commission are in the process of being passed by the lower house of parliament.
Speaker of the lower house, Taranath Ranabhat, said that along with legislation, social awareness was equally important in fighting discrimination.

NC president and former prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, had during a parliament session demanded Deuba either withdraw his proposal or resign, a highly placed cabinet source told AFP.
Deuba sees the six-month extension of the state of emergency as essential to combat a bloody Maoist rebellion in the country. The current state of emergency imposed in November expires on May 25 and needs approval from both houses of parliament if it is to be extended.
The emergency allows the government to impose curfews, send the army to fight the guerrillas and gives local authorities more leeway to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.
Koirala however has opposed the extension on grounds it could compromise the country's democratic system.
""If the emergency rule is extended again, the democratic system in the country might face a dangerous situation,"" Koirala said earlier this week. He is supported in his opposition by all the left-wing parties.
Opposition parties have argued that recently passed anti-terrorism laws are enough to nail down the rebels.
Dueba will face the party leadership on Wednesday when the source said there would be ""no question of his resignation.""
""He would rather face the dissident group of law makers in the party and in the parliament,"" the source said.
If Dueba comes under too much pressure he could ask King Gyanendra to disband parliament, two years before the general elections, or even split the party into two factions, the source said.
However, the Western diplomats are said to be happy with Deuba's tough measures against the Maoists.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed nearly 4,000.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council that identifies parties in conflicts that recruit children to fight, in an attempt to send a message that the international community is watching.
The report, being released in full on Monday, lists 23 parties, including governments and insurgents in Afghanistan, Burundi, Congo, Liberia and Somalia, that recruit and use child soldiers in violation of internationally accepted standards.
""For the first time in an official report to the Security Council, those who violate standards for the protection of war-affected children have been specifically named and listed,"" said Olara Otunnu, Annan's special representative for children and armed conflict.
Annan's third report to the council on children and armed conflict said the list was ""an important step forward in our efforts to induce compliance … with international child protection obligation,"" according to Otunnu's statement.
It clearly demonstrates that those who violate standards aimed at protecting children ""cannot do so with impunity,"" the statement said.
The report noted that ""impressive gains"" have been made in codifying international norms and standards to protect children during conflict, including three Security Council resolutions and two landmark international treaties that entered into force this year setting age limits.
But more needs to be done to raise awareness about those standards and to strengthen monitoring and reporting mechanisms ""to identify and take measures against the violators,"" the report said.
The list was limited to situations currently on the Security Council's agenda, but it highlighted other conflicts - including Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Sudan, northern Uganda and Sri Lanka - where it said children are recruited and used as combatants.
It also named conflicts that recently ended in Angola, Kosovo, the Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, where demobilization and reintegration programs for child combatants are under way.
""This is the beginning of a systematic effort in a new era of monitoring and reporting on the conduct of parties and how they treat children during conflict,"" Otunnu said.
The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers last year estimated that more than 300,000 children were fighting as soldiers in 41 countries.
The London-based coalition said the children, including about 120,000 in African armies, were used as front-line fighters, minesweepers, spies, porters and sex slaves.
International law prohibits recruiting children under the age of 15, while several United Nations conventions condemn the practice of having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - A would-be suicide bomber with more than a half-ton of explosives packed into his car was just 300 yards from the U.S. Embassy on Monday when he was stopped by a chance traffic accident, a top Afghan intelligence official reported Tuesday.
Foreign intelligence information indicated the alleged terrorist, who was captured by Afghan authorities after a car chase through Kabul, is a foreigner and a member of the al-Qaida terror group, said Amonullah Barakzai, deputy director of the Afghan intelligence service.
""He was on a suicide mission,"" Barakzai said. But he said Afghan authorities were not sure whether his target was the embassy, other foreign installations or the Afghan leadership, including President Hamid Karzai, whose palace offices are about a half-mile from the accident scene.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said late Monday a second unidentified man also had been arrested in the case. But Barakzai reported only the single arrest, and said investigators had not determined the man's identity or nationality.
Explosion in central Jerusalem causes several injuries, police say
 
JERUSALEM (AP) - A suicide bomber set off explosives Tuesday at the entrance of a central Jerusalem food stand popular with police, killing himself and injuring four Israelis, police said.
It was the first suicide bombing in Jerusalem since a pair of attacks June 18-19 killed 26 Israelis and prompted the army to occupy seven of the eight major Palestinian towns in the West Bank.
Elsewhere, masked Palestinian gunmen hiding behind olive trees shot and killed two Israeli settlers who had gone to a Palestinian village in the West Bank for business, residents and military sources said.
Settlers and residents said the two Israelis, from the Jewish settlement of Tapuach, had gone to the village of Jammaien, south of the West Bank city of Nablus, to sell fuel. The area is under Israeli security control.
The army confirmed the deaths and said troops were searching the area for the gunmen.
The shooting occurred as Palestinians in Nablus defied the Israeli-imposed army curfew for the third day in a row, restoring a semblance of normal life in the city after more than a month of military occupation.
 
Trio of leaders of troubled telecom companies being called before Congress
 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Leaders of three big, troubled telecommunications companies are being called before Congress to explain how well they can maintain essential operations if their financial conditions deteriorate further.
Top executives of WorldCom Inc., which filed the biggest corporate bankruptcy in history on July 21; Global Crossing Ltd., also bankrupt; and Qwest Communications International Inc., which acknowledged major accounting errors Sunday, are testifying before a Senate committee.
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission - which already has filed civil fraud charges against WorldCom - are investigating accounting irregularities at the telecom titan whose interests include No. 2 long-distance telephone company MCI.
WorldCom disclosed it had disguised nearly $4 billion in expenses, thereby inflating its earnings.
 
Investigators probe Amtrak train derailment that left 97 hurt
 
KENSINGTON, Md. (AP) - Investigators recovered data recorders from the wreckage of an Amtrak train that they say should provide clues into why the train jumped off the tracks outside the nation's capital, leaving 97 passengers injured.
The crash sent bleeding passengers crawling out windows and left a 150-yard stretch of damaged track along the accident site, including twisted rails and ties ripped from the gravel bed. Six of the train's 13-cars lay on their side.
The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team of investigators, and an expert said they would try to determine whether heat had caused the track to buckle. Temperatures were in the mid-90s at the time of the accident.
Carol Carmody, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Monday evening at the scene of the accident that two event recorders had been recovered from the train.
The train, the Capitol Limited, was traveling from Chicago to the nation's capital with 173 passengers and crew members when it went off the tracks at about 1:55 p.m. Monday, authorities said. The train was about 10 miles from its destination.

It was not clear whether the staffer, Siraj Ahmad Siddiqui, had been arrested.
Officials would not talk openly of the case, coming a day before Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was to arrive for a regional summit.
An officer who identified himself as Deputy Superintendent of Police Sikdel at the office of Nepal's police chief said only that the detainment ""may be about cash transactions.""
India says Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency has an operation in Nepal that prints fake money and assembles weapons for Islamic guerrillas opposed to India's control over part of Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan.
Pakistan denies the allegations.
Police sources said Siddiqui was taken into custody from the busy Thamel shopping district in the capital, Katmandu, on Thursday evening, and that he was found with fake U.S. and Indian currency of an unspecified value. Police then searched his house, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan Embassy officials were unavailable for comment late Thursday.
The leaders of seven South Asian nations, including archrivals India and Pakistan, will meet in Katmandu starting Friday for a three-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
Fresh border tensions between India and Pakistan have overshadowed the regional summit.

In central and western Nepal, many young people fled from their homes to escape the anti-government guerrillas' conscription and get rid of the guerrillas' retaliation against those whose relatives are serving in the government security forces, the independent English daily said quoting data provided by the police.
The other reasons behind the exodus are poverty and lack of food, the daily noted, adding that food crisis is hitting the western districts of Bajura, Bajhang, Kalikot, Achham and Dailekh, which are known as anti-government guerrillas' base areas.
The anti-government insurgency has claimed over 7,500 lives since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996. More than 4,000 guerrillas and hundreds of security personnel and civilians were killed since the government imposed a state of emergency on Nov.  26 last year.
The insurgents have stepped up their violent activities across the country after the nine-month-long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August this year.

A total of 16,743 tourists entered into Nepal from the Tribhuvan International airport, the only international airport of the country, in February while 30,814 tourists visited Nepal during the same month last year, the daily reported quoting statistics provided by Nepal Tourism Board.
The tourist arrivals from third countries have declined by 46 percent while tourists from India, the largest tourist source for Nepal, decreased by 41 percent, the daily said, adding that the inflow of tourists from Nepal's major markets, including the United States, Britain, Japan and Germany, all recorded a decline.
The only market showing promise during the period was China, which recorded a growth of over 17.5 percent compared with the figure of last year.
""This is the traditional peak season for the hotel business.  However, we see no visitors and if the situation remains as it is now, the golden future of tourism will collapse,"" said Netra Gurung, operation manager of a resort.
The major reasons behind the decline in the tourist arrivals are the escalating violence by the anti-government guerrillas in Nepal and the continuing terrorist threats to the world after the terrorist attack in the United States on September 11 last year, the board said.
Tourism is one of the main foreign currency earners for the Himalayan kingdom,  earning about 150 million U.S. dollars last year.

""The prime minister took this decision without giving the slightest hint to his council of ministers.
It is undemocratic and unfair,"" Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told reporters.
Mahat said he, Education Minister Amod Prasad Upadhyay and Women and Children's Welfare Minister Rajendra Kharel had submitted resignation letters to Deuba.
He will hand them over to King Gyanendra, who must approve resignations.
""We are very sad that the prime minister, whom we have supported all along, did not take us into confidence. The move to disband parliament gives an uncertain direction to the country, so we have decided to resign,"" Kharel said.
More members of Deuba's 40-member council of ministers are also expected to resign in coming days, sources in the ruling Nepali Congress party said.
King Gyanendra late Wednesday dissolved the 205-seat parliament on the recommendation of Deuba and called new elections for November 13, two years ahead of schedule.
The step came after parliament looked set to defeat a proposed six-month extension of emergency rule, imposed in late November to fight Maoist rebels.
But the ministers who resigned Thursday said they had supported lengthening the emergency and Deuba's hawkish approach against the Maoists.
""We have supported the emergency and the full use of the army to control Maoist terrorism and maintain law and order,"" Mahat said.
He said the ministers were instead angry that leading officials were left out of the decision to disband parliament.

Prior to his departure, Deuba told reporters he would discuss the 'fight against terrorism' during half-hour talks with Bush in the White House on Tuesday.
The Nepalese premier is expected to seek moral backing as well as logistic support for its six-year-old fight against the rebels of the outlawed Nepal Communist Party (Maoist).
The Bush administration has been supportive of the Nepalese government in its efforts to tackle the insurgency and recently asked Congress to provide a $20 million aid package to Nepal.
Nepal is mainly seeking logistical support such as equipment and military hardware as well as training for Nepalese security forces.
Deuba will also co-chair one of the special sessions of the U.N. Special Session for Children in New York before traveling to Britain for a meeting with British Minister Tony Blair.

Gandhi, who ruled India for some 15 years before her 1984 assassination, still elicits passions. A magazine poll last year ranked her as India's most popular prime minister, but she is loathed in some quarters for imposing emergency rule and other iron-fisted measures.
""Her life was more dramatic than many commercial Hindi films,"" said Nitin Keni, the producer of the 150-million-rupee (three-million-dollar) movie.
The film, due out next year, is entitled ""Indira Gandhi: A Tryst with Destiny,"" an allusion to the speech her father, India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, delivered at independence from Britain in 1947.
Chosen to play India's most controversial woman is Bollywood starlet Manisha Koirala, who herself is no stranger to controversy or political power.
Koirala raised a storm earlier this year when she demanded one of her films be banned because of nude scenes with her character shot with a double. And she is the granddaughter of B.P. Koirala, neighbouring Nepal's first democratically elected premier and a contemporary of Nehru.
Keni said Koirala was chosen after computerised tests were conducted of leading Indian actresses juxtaposed with Gandhi's image.
""The similarity between Koirala and Indira Gandhi was striking,"" Keni told AFP.
Gandhi made enemies in 1975 when she declared an emergency, arresting opposition leaders as part of a campaign she said would root out corruption and other ills plaguing India. She also came under fire for a massive sterilisation programme to trim population growth.
Gandhi was booted out of power in 1977 but returned in 1980. She was assassinated four years later by her Sikh bodyguards after she ordered a raid on separatist militants holed up in the religion's holiest temple.
Despite the controversies surrounding Gandhi, Keni said ""A Tryst with Destiny,"" directed by the well-known N. Chandra, would have a ""strong emphasis on objectivity.""
He said the movie would also try to show the more human dramas of Gandhi, including her strained relationships with her famous father and her husband Feroz.
""The movie will not only be about Gandhi's political life, but will portray how a once shy girl was transformed into one of India's most powerful and controversial leaders,"" said Keni.
""Almost 20 years have passed since her assassination. The unnatural deaths not only of Gandhi but also both her sons and the aura that surrounded her political life make her an enigmatic figure and an excellent subject for a feature film,"" he said.
Gandhi's son Sanjay died in 1980 at age 34 in a plane accident. Her other son, Rajiv, went on to become prime minister -- and died in 1991 in a suicide bombing by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels. Rajiv's Italian-born widow, Sonia, now leads Gandhi's Congress party, which is currently in opposition.
Keni made clear that Gandhi's life would be a ""serious mainstream film"" and not a collection of song-and-dance numbers that are favoured by India's Bollywood film industry.
""It is not a regular Bollywood potboiler,"" Keni said.
Instead, he said his model would be Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning 1982 epic of India's pacifist independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was not related to Indira.
""We are leaving no stone unturned and the research for our film will be just like what Attenborough must have done for his Gandhi,"" Keni said.

Musharraf, who had to make a detour via China to get to Nepal after a no-fly ban imposed on his country by arch-rival India, finally arrived on Friday afternoon after his flight was held up for several hours due to bad weather.
""Because of the Pakistani president's late arrival the summit has been put off,"" an official said.
Nepal's foreign ministry confirmed that the retreat of the South Asian leaders scheduled for Saturday had now been cancelled to allow the summit to close as scheduled on Sunday.
The leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were to have been taken to Nagarkot, 12 kilometres (eight miles) northeast of the Kathmandu valley to witness the sunrise over Mount Everest.
The cancelled retreat would have been one of the few opportunities for Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to meet privately away from the glare of television cameras.
International attention has focused on the summit here because it promised to bring the leaders of the region's nuclear rivals India and Pakistan together in the same room even though they were not scheduled to hold one-to-one talks.
India and Pakistan have massed troops on their border since last month's attack on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups.
The summit, which was originally due to begin Friday morning and then was put off until the afternoon, will now open Saturday at 11:00 am (0515 GMT).
According to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) charter, summits cannot take place unless all members are represented by either their heads of state or government.
Despite the readjustment to the timetable, the seven SAARC leaders will still attend a banquet hosted later Friday by Nepal's King Gyanendra, a Pakistani official said.
There was no formal reaction from other delegations already in Nepal to the unexpected postponment of the summit, the 11th for the regional body established in 1985.
Indian officials privately played down the delay and stressed that the agenda of the summit itself would remain unchanged.
""The intention will be to cover all grounds,"" said one Indian official.
New Delhi had announced a no-fly ban for Pakistan aircraft over Indian airspace as retaliatory action for the December 13 attack on the Indian parliament, which it says was sponsored by Islamabad.
Musharraf declined special permission to fly over Indian airspace which could have saved him the detour to fly over China. However, he made use of the extended route to hold talks with Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, a key ally, before leaving for Nepal.
Musharraf was the last to arrive and was scheduled to meet with Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and King Gyanendra.
Earlier in the day, Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia arrived for the summit.
India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maldives President Gayoom have been here since Thursday.
The first to land was Bhutan's Prime Minister Lyonpo Khanda Wangchuk who arrived on Wednesday.

Political parties and human rights groups joined the government in asking people to defy the five-day strike call, which shut down most of this Himalayan kingdom on Tuesday.
Fear of reprisals from rebel supporters, which kept most people indoors on the first day of the strike, subsided Wednesday after the government increased security and threatened bus and taxi operators with the loss of their licenses.
The army and police had orders to shoot supporters of the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for six years to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a Maoist-style communist state, and offered a reward for anyone who aids in the capture of top rebel leaders.
""Maoists will now be wary of coming out in the open,"" said Hari Shrestha, who opened his garment shop Wednesday in defiance of the strike call.
Scattered violence continued when Maoist supporters burned a minibus on the outskirts of Katmandu Wednesday. Passengers told The Associated Press that everyone managed to flee before the vehicle was set on fire.
In western Nepal rebels set fire to a vacant farmhouse owned by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in Dandeldhura district, 550 kilometers (340 miles) northwest of Katmandu, a local official said. There were no casualties reported from that attack.
State-run Radio Nepal said the rebels also attacked a radio transmission tower in Mohtari village, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Katmandu, knocking out service in the east Tuesday night.
Police said two officers were killed Tuesday night when police and soldiers tried to retrieve four ambulances that the rebels had seized on Monday near Chitwan, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Katmandu.
In Katmandu, government ministers toured the capital, asking people to open their businesses. Security was tightened around main market places. More vehicles were on the roads Wednesday, but their number plates were taped over so they could not be identified by strike supporters.
More than 3,000 people have died since the insurgents began fighting in 1996. They stepped up attacks on government offices and police after talks with the government failed and King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency on Nov. 26.
The government has ruled out peace talks until the rebels give up violence, and is seeking international help to fight them. Washington plans dlrs 20 million in military aid for Nepal, the U.S. state department said Tuesday.

Local radio said the device had been planted at a local council building in the city.
The attack came as the cabinet and the security council, which includes the prime minister, defence minister and army chief, were due to meet to assess the security situation in the city.
Bombs have gone off or been defused in and around Kathmandu every day since last Wednesday when a state of emergency was lifted for the first time in 10 months.

The long-delayed summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), due to open Friday in Kathmandu, comes less than a month after a deadly assault on India's parliament which New Delhi charges was carried out by Islamic militants at the behest of Pakistan's intelligence service.
The countries have massed troops along their border since the December 13 attack, but in recent days India has said it was encouraged by Pakistan's arrests of members of two groups it blames for the incident.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has publicly ruled out a meeting with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in Kathmandu, but India has since held out the possibility of some bilateral dialogue, such as talks between foreign ministers.
However, any negotiations between the two countries -- which have fought three full wars since independence from Britain in 1947 -- will likely be diplomatic minefields, with New Delhi and Islamabad disagreeing even on how to get to the summit.
In one measure to turn the screws on Islamabad, India banned Pakistani planes from flying over its airspace. But the government said Pakistan had requested an exemption for Musharraf to fly to Kathmandu and said New Delhi would oblige.
Pakistan denied the story, however, and said Musharraf would fly to Nepal via Tibet with pilots provided by key ally China.
The last time Musharraf and Vajpayee met was in July in the Taj Mahal city of Agra, when the talks deadlocked over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
The two sides have little common ground on Kashmir, with Pakistan demanding that India seek a political resolution to the separatist conflict in its only Muslim-majority state and New Delhi insisting that the real problem lies in Islamabad's support of Islamic militants waging a ""proxy war.""
In a New Year's message, however, Vajpayee appeared to take a more flexible approach.
""Shed your anti-India mentality and take effective steps to stop cross-border terrorism, and you will find India willing to walk more than half the distance to work closely with Pakistan to resolve, through dialogue, any issue, including the contentious issue of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he wrote.
But Vajpayee has been facing pressure from within his Hindu-nationalist BJP party to take tougher action -- perhaps even launch military strikes -- on Pakistani territory if Islamabad does not completely crack down on anti-Indian Islamic militants.
Musharraf, meanwhile, has already irritated hardline segments of the population by supporting the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan and leads a country where many passionately oppose Indian rule of Kashmir.
The high drama of Indian-Pakistani relations threatens to overshadow all other discussions at the summit of SAARC, a bloc founded in 1985 that also includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
Discussions in Kathmandu are also expected to focus on expanding commerce within the region, curbing the drug trade and the trafficking of women and children as prostitutes, and cleaning-up the environment.

"46",2002604,"Title: At least 65 killed in latest Maoist attack in Nepal _ radio.rtf; Date: September 9, 2002 Monday; Text: At least 65 police and soldiers were killed when Maoist rebels in Nepal launched a massive attack on security posts a day after executing nearly 50 security personnel in a different part of the country, state-run radio reported on Monday.
Sources told AFP as many as 4,000 rebels were involved in the raids overnight at Sandhikharka in Arghakanchi district, 215 kilometres (134 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
The radio said the rebels attacked a police post, an army camp and government offices in the town.
The fighting, which continued for seven hours, left 31 policemen, 17 armed police officers and 17 soldiers dead, it added.
Minister of State for Home Devendra Raj Kandel confirmed that 56 security force personnel had died but said the toll could rise. He added that three policemen had been kidnapped by the rebels as they left.
Officials said they feared the deputy district chief may have been killed in the attack but this was not confirmed.
The rebels also shot at two army helicopters, damaging them slightly, the radio said.
The huge raids came as the government of Nepal was considering renewing a state of emergency which was first imposed in November last year to combat the rebels but which lapsed on August 28.
Just 24 hours earlier 49 policemen were lined up and executed with shots to the head when 1,000 Maoist rebels attacked a police post at Bhimad in the eastern Sindhuli district, 85 kilometres east of Kathmandu, officials said. Ten more were injured.
Kandel said as many as 70 rebels may have been killed in those clashes.
Emergency rule was introduced after the guerrillas broke a four-month ceasefire with the government and pulled out of peace talks.
At the same time the Royal Nepal Army was ordered into action against the rebels for the first time.
The emergency gave local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected rebels and impose curfews.
But opposition and rights groups said it curtailed human rights and was not effective in the fight against the guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1996 for a communist republic. The insurgency has so far claimed more than 4,400 lives.
It was renewed twice but expired late last month and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba decided not to extend it again because he has called an election for November 13.
But since it expired there have been almost daily blasts in the Nepalese capital, which have injured several people. A soldier was killed trying to defuse one of the bombs.
On Monday a bomb planted in the heart of Kathmandu was defused by the army.
The rebels have not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police suspect they are involved.
Deuba last week said the government was considering reimposing the emergency.

The two-hour meeting came a day before parliament is due to begin its winter session on Sunday.
""The prime minister appealed to the opposition leaders to support the emergency rule,"" Minister for Information and Communications Jaya Prakash Gupta told AFP.
""The talks were held in a very cordial atmosphere,"" he added.
Emergency rule was imposed for three months on November 26 to control Maoist rebels after they broke a four-month ceasefire and pulled out of peace talks.
The government wants to extend the emergency, but needs a two-thirds majority in the 205-member lower house of parliament, which could be difficult as opposition parties have said they want to see it lifted.
The ruling Nepali Congress has 113 MPs in the lower house.
""The premier explained to the leaders about the gains of the state emergency and the law and order situation in the country,"" Gupta said..
During the meeting, some opposition leaders were critical of the emergency, which they feel has curtailed human rights and freedom of the press, a Nepali Congress source said.
To allay their fears, Gupta told them that all those who had been arrested under the emergency on suspicion of being Maoists were being thoroughly investigated and all those who were innocent of any wrong doing would be set free.
The main opposition, Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), the Nepal Communist Party-Marxist Leninist (NCP-ML), the rightist National Democratic Party (NDP), the United National People's Front (UNPF), the pro-India Nepal Sadbhawana Party (NGP), attended the meeting.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist regime since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed the lives of over 2,300 people.

""We will send a copy of the resolution to the ILO by the end of this month,"" Jena said, adding the conference also vowed to flush out criminal elements associated with the profession.

Scores of people, many of them Muslims, have already been picked up in an initial police sweep after Tuesday morning's attack in which four gunmen rode up to the Centre on motorbikes and opened fire with AK-47s on several dozen police guards standing outside.
It was the first terrorist attack in living memory in Calcutta, the setting of French novelist Dominique Lapierre's bestseller, ""City of Joy.""
Siddikullah Chowdhury, state president of the Jamiat-Ulema-Hind Islamic political forum, accused West Bengal's Marxist rulers of using the American Center attack as an excuse to harrass local Muslims.
""Terrorism has no caste and so why are the peace-loving Muslims of West Bengal being harassed?"" the widely-respected leader told AFP, as police arrested three popular Islamic priests in a swoop on city suburbs.
""It is nothing but an anti-Muslim pogrom and if this continues then the peace of our state and city will be destroyed forever.""
Echoing Chowdhury's words, the chief Islamic cleric of the historic Tipu Sultan mosque, Nur Rahman Barkati, warned the attack was destined to drive a wedge into the bustling city's community.
""The police are perpetrating atrocities on our community on the pretext of finding the attackers. It is unjust. We are as good Indians as anyone else,"" the Islamic cleric said.
There were several anonymous calls claiming responsibility for the Centre shooting, but India chose to highlight one from a Dubai-based criminal, Farhan Malik.
Home Minister L.K. Advani said Malik, an underworld don, had links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency and the Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami, a Pakistan-based Islamic militant group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir.
Calcutta, with a dozen British-built clubs, bustling shopping malls, all-night watering holes and a popular horse-racing circuit, has not witnessed the sort of extremist or communal violence that has visited many of India's major cities in the past decades.
Pradip Bhattacharya, a leader of West Bengal's opposition Congress party, said Tuesday's strike should serve as a ""wake-up call"" to the state government and security forces.
""Calcutta's tranquility is now destroyed. The people of the state feel insecure and it is time to find ways to prepare against terrorism,"" the leading politician said.
Sabyasachi Roychowdhury, a professor of international relations at Calcutta's prestigious Robindra Bharati University, said Tuesday's shooting was an attack waiting to happen.
""West Bengal has become a haven for terrorists as it has a porous border with adjoining Bangladesh and Nepal and many terrorist organisations are operating from Calcutta and its suburbs as security is negligible in the city,"" he said.
Warned Idris Ali, president of All-India Minority Forum said ""unknown forces"" were trying to create a rift between Hindus and Muslims.
""They want to spark off unrest which will be dangerous and destroy the peace of Calcutta."" Ali said of the city of 10 million people of which 25 percent are estimated to be Muslims.

Police believe the bomb was planted by Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a communist state.
Many of the injured were watching troops try to defuse the bomb on a bridge in the Kalimati neighborhood. The wounded included a soldier, a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
On Wednesday, government troops killed 10 guerrillas during several gun battles and foiled a rebel attack on district headquarters in western Nepal, police said.
Security troops had been tipped off about a possible attack, police said. The district police chief was among the injured.
The rebels draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. More than 2,800 people have been killed in the six-year insurgency.
A state of emergency was imposed in Nepal on Nov. 26 after rebels abruptly pulled out of peace talks with the government and the army was called in to fight the guerrillas.

The All Nepal National Free Student Union Revolutionary is demanding lower fees in private schools, which they say should be managed by the government.
Education up to fifth grade is free in government schools, but those who can afford it like to send their children to private schools where the quality of education and facilities are better.
The rebels say the growing divide between students from government and private schools can be bridged only by bringing all schools under government control.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting security forces since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and create a communist republic. More than 2,400 people have died in the fighting.
The group was accused of setting on fire two private schools in the capital Katmandu last week.
A state of emergency was imposed in the country on Nov. 26, and the army was ordered to fight the rebels, after they broke off peace talks and began new attacks. Previously only the ill-armed police fought the rebels.

Powell, who made a brief stop over in Kathmandu on Friday and Saturday, was the highest-ranking US official to visit the small Himalayan kingdom in more than 30 years.
""We fully acknowlege the government of Nepal's right to protect its citizens and institutions from terrorist attacks,"" Powell said after talks with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
But he did not promise concrete aid to help Nepal combat the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting to overthrow the constitutional monarchy since 1996.
In November the government declared emergency rule to combat renewed violence by the guerrillas and branded them as terrorists after they broke a four-month ceasefire and backed out of peace talks. Altogether more than 2,300 people have died in the violence since 1996.
Kapil Shrestha, professor of polical science at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, said the visit of such a high-profile US government figure would send a strong signal to the Maoists that the government would not back down in its fight.
""The Maoists will have to think twice now before launching more violence because the most powerful country in the world is behind the government,"" he said.
""Powell's visit is encouraging and sends a very postive signal to remote corners of the world like Nepal, which is also fighting against the menace of terrorism and struggling to consolidate democracy in spite of difficult odds,"" he added.
""The visit should change the impression that the US is not sensitive to the problems of smaller countries.""
Nepalese officials hailed the visit as a success.
""The visit was very successful and result-oriented though no special commitment on the supply of arms was made,"" minister of state for foreign affairs Arjun Junga Bahadur Singh told AFP.
Singh, who attended the talks at Deuba's official residence, said Nepal got the opportunity to discuss its pressing problems, such as the Maoists, and the crisis in trade and tourism because of the insurgency and in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on US.
Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries and earlier this week hiked taxes and custom duties by up to 50 percent to raise two billion rupees (26.13 million dollars) of an extra five billion rupees Kathmandu wants to finance the fight against the Maoists.
A senior US official said Nepal had not asked for cash to support the military operation but for development funding for education and health care, the lack of which has fomented interest in the rebellion.
""During the talks we put up our various problems … and we are hopeful of positive results on Mr Powell's return to Washington,"" Singh said.
""Mr Powell has expressed full assurance of continued US cooperation to Nepal for future economic development,"" he added.
""He also said the US appreciated the Nepalese stance against terrorism and government measures taken to strengthen democracy and combat terrorism.""
As well as meeting King Gyanendra, Powell met the Nepalese Chief of Army Staff General Prajjwol Shumshere J.B. Rana at army headquarters on Saturday morning.
During the meeting Nepal sought US assistance for the supply of arms and helicopters to help combat the Maoists, a highly placed defence source said.
Powell, whose visit came after stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, was the highest ranking US official to visit Nepal since vice president Spiro Agnew in 1971.

"59",20022570,"Title: Top Maoist negotiator says Nepal will soon give in on demands.rtf; Date: November 15, 2002 Friday; Text: The top negotiator for Nepal's Maoist rebels Friday said the government would soon agree to talks on the terms of the guerrillas, who are demanding an assembly that would abolish the monarchy.
""All political parties are in favor of the Maoist movement and the whole world is putting pressure for peace talks and then an interim government,"" Krishna Bahadur Mahara told CNN.
""In such a situation, the king does not have any other possibility but to take these talks forward. What I can say sitting now is that the king's army will not fight for very long,"" he said.
Mahara headed the rebels' delegation at three rounds of talks with then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's government in 2001.
The negotiations failed over the Maoists' demands for a ""constituent assembly"" that would redraft the constitution -- in which the Maoists want to see the monarchy abolished.
Last month, King Gyanendra sacked Deuba and replaced him with a staunch royalist who will serve until new elections are held. Mahara said the move showed the constitutional monarch wants ""power for himself.""
""The government is not agreeing to our proposal for a constituent assembly because they know that they'll lose,"" Mahara said.
""They just have the support of the army and certain pimps in position of power. The common man is against them.""
Mahara went underground after the talks last year failed and has a 65,000-dollar bounty on his head. CNN did not state where the interview took place.
The Maoists' rebellion has claimed more than 7,100 lives since 1996, according to official figures. On Friday, police said they feared some 50 Maoists and 22 policemen were killed in a fierce battle in western Nepal.
Mahara did not give an alternative death toll from the insurgency but claimed that many Maoists the government has claimed to have killed were civilians.
""More than 80 percent of them (killed Maoists) were innocent civilians,"" Mahara said.
He said the Maoists, known for massive attacks on security posts, ""have only killed the criminal elements of our society and that too after issuing them several warnings and it was done in front of the people and according to the wishes of the people.""
The rebels' killings and destruction of property in areas under their control has led US diplomats to liken them to Cambodia's ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge, who slaughtered more than 1.7 million Cambodians in the 1970s.
""We do adopt the strategies and tactics of all the past wars fought for the freedom of people all over the world,"" Mahara said.
But he said ""allegations that we fight like the Khmer Rouge are absolutely wrong. We are fighting for our cause in our own style.""

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Powell said he hopes the two countries would remove their differences as early as possible.
Powell, on a peace mission to defuse military tensions between Pakistan and India, also urged Pakistani government leaders on Wednesday to seek a diplomatic and political solution over India's charges of cross-border terrorism.
Powell said the Pakistani government may consider handing over Pakistan-based Indian nationals accused of terrorist activities in India if the Indian government provides sufficient evidence to Pakistan.
India wants Pakistan to hand over 20 criminal and terrorist suspects. Pakistan has ruled out the handing over its nationals, saying they would undergo trial in their own country. New Delhi maintains that 15 of the wanted men are Indians and Islamabad should hand them over.
Powell met over dinner with Singh shortly arriving after a brief visit to Afghanistan. His arrival coincided with a bomb explosion in a busy market in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir State, killing one man and injuring eight others, the police said.
New Delhi accuses Pakistan of waging a separatist war in Jammu and Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Muslim majority. Pakistan denies the allegations, saying it is lending only moral and political support to Islamic separatists.
Powell will also call on Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajapayee and National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra on Friday morning before leaving for a visit to Nepal.
During a visit to Pakistan on Wednesday, Powell ruled out U.S. mediation in Kashmir, the most contentious issue between India and Pakistan for more than 50 years, and urged India and Pakistan to resolve their differences through talks.
Powell said he is carrying 'some ideas' to New Delhi for initiating a dialogue between the two rivals.
Tension on the heavily fortified frontiers of the two arch-rivals remains high. Both countries have rejected scaling back their military buildup, the most extensive since their independence from Britain in 1947 following an attack on the Indian parliament on Dec. 13.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has banned five militant organizations, including the two accused of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and more than 2,000 militants have been detained since the crackdown began last week.
While India gave a cautious welcome to Musharraf's speech last Saturday announcing the crackdown, New Delhi has insisted that cross-border terrorism must end before any military de-escalation and dialogue.

""At least two assailants left the venue immediately after shooting at Dipak Pokharel at about 4:00 p.m. at his rented house in the Buddhanagar area of Patan, a city adjoining Kathmandu city, "" independent English daily The Kathmandu Post reported Sunday, quoting Tapendra Dhoj Hamal, chief of the Kathmandu District Police office.
""Pokharel was shot twice on his head with a pistol while he was asleep on his bed after night duty,"" Hamal said, adding that his body was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead.
""Although no one has claimed responsibility for the murder, the needle of suspicion points towards the anti-government insurgents, "" he added.
Pokharel, a local Nepalese, had joined the US Embassy Security System only a fortnight ago after completing a month's training.
This is the second time that a security personnel working for the US Embassy to Nepal has been murdered within a year. On Dec.  15 last year, suspected anti-government insurgents killed Ramesh Manadhar while he was on inspection of security personnel guarding the US organizations in Kathmandu city.
The US Embassy to Nepal is still offering a 500,000 Nepali rupees (about 6,410 US dollars) award for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Manandhar's murderers. However, nobody has yet been arrested up to now.
Both the US government and the US Embassy to Nepal have expressed full support to the Nepali government in curbing the anti-government insurgency in the Himalayan kingdom.

A meeting of the groups was called by Nepal Human Rights Organisation due to the ""gravity of the situation created by the union in the educational field affecting the future of the millions of students,"" the NHRO statement said.
""Representatives of various organisations, including other human rights bodies, industrial organisations and associations of teachers and students, took part in the wide-ranging meeting,"" it added.
After long discussions, the meeting urged the government and the students to hold talks to find a solution to the problem.
The participants also appealed to the government to take the students' demands seriously and create an atmosphere favourable for talks.
At the same time, they urged the All Nepal National Free Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU-R) to restrain itself and work responsibly towards finding a solution.
Around 2,000 private and 2,000 public education institutions in the Kathmandu Valley have been closed since Monday due to the strike, affecting more than 500,000 students.
The union's demands include reduction of tuition fees in private schools, removal of Sanskrit language from schools, removal of the ""terrorist"" tag labelled against ANNFSU-R and free schooling for all children up to the age of 16.
In a bid to head off the strike, the government last week announced a 29-point reform package programme.
The union, however, says the reforms do not go far enough.
Maoist guerrillas have been fighting a ""people's war"" to overthrow the constitutional monarchy since 1996 and some 7,300 have died since then.

It was the third explosion in as many days in Katmandu.
Police believe the bomb was planted by Maoist guerrillas fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy.
The blast occurred near a street where thousands of devotees were to pass through later in the day to visit a temple of the Hindu god, Krishna.
Windows of the building were shattered and the exterior wall was damaged in the blast, a police official at the site said on condition of anonymity.
The area was cordoned off by the army, and a bomb disposal unit was called in to inspect a suspicious package in a nearby garbage dump.
On Thursday, a soldier was killed when a small bomb, wrapped in cloth and hung on an electricity pole, exploded when he tried to defuse it.
On Wednesday, a powerful explosion rocked a shopping mall in the main shopping district of Katmandu, damaging more than a dozen shops but causing no injuries.
Police blame all of the explosions on the Maoist rebels, who are seeking a communist state. The insurgents are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
The Maoists have intensified their attacks since the failure of peace talks between the government and the rebels in October.
The government says nearly 5,000 people, including 3,290 rebels, have been killed in the fighting since 1996.

"64",20022825,"Title: Amateurs take Field in Elephant Polo.rtf; Date: September 22, 2002 Sunday; Text: Your mount is a two-ton beast of a breed that once stomped Asian armies into mush. You carry a slender shaft, long as a knight's lance. Your pith helmet is right out of Rudyard Kipling.
Now you're carried down the field to confront two equally enormous opponents. Behemoths collide. Commands are shouted. Mallets swing, thrust, parry. And the exhilarating, unabashedly elitist but appealing sport of polo is under way.
Elephant polo, that is.
In this particular contest, however, images of medieval derring-do and British Raj romance quickly crumble. We players - a bunch of none-too-youthful reporters pitted against four glamorous Thai TV and movie stars - happen to be rank amateurs, recruited for a curtain-raising ""exhibition"" to this year's real thing, the King's Cup Elephant Polo Tournament.
Despite the best efforts of the remarkable, specially trained elephants, including some cheeky cheating on our behalf, we did not look elite.
""Hey Rodney, your elephant played more than you did,"" someone shouted after the first chukka, or 10-minute period of play.
While Rodney Tasker, correspondent for the news magazine Far Eastern Economic Review, scored our only goal, he later admitted that ""the elephants seem to be the main players,"" doing their utmost to get into the best position to allow the curious humans teetering on their rolling rumps to smack the ball.
Doro, a mischievous 8-year-old female, appeared to get so frustrated with all of Rodney's misses that she helped him along by moving the ball smartly with her trunk and legs. This included perhaps the crispest shot of the day, a beautifully timed, surreptitious sideswipe with her right hind leg that put the ball out of reach of Rodney's onrushing opponent.
Elephants aren't supposed to interfere in the play, but such infractions are normally overlooked, said our referee and elephant polo veteran Col. Raj Kalaan. Fouls are called when an elephant grabs the ball with its trunk and passes it to the player or lies across the goal mouth. At last year's King's Cup the ball kept vanishing because one pachyderm liked to stomp it into the ground.
It was Kalaan, a retired Indian army officer of patrician demeanor and silvery mustache, who initiated us into the rules, rituals and history of the game during a sweltering morning practice session before the match.
Kalaan, who keeps a polo field and 22 horses on his estate outside New Delhi, is a committee member of the World Elephant Polo Association, set up in 1982 to stage annual games near Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park. Matches have also been played in Sri Lanka, and last year Thailand hosted its first tournament at this seaside resort to raise funds for elephant conservation.
The 2002 event, which ended on the weekend, drew nine teams from six countries, including Australia, Germany, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
From the start, the sport has attracted avid horse polo players and holdovers from an earlier era of moneyed gentlemen eccentrics.
Regulars include sport co-founders James Manclark, who has searched for lost Inca treasure and bobsledded for England in the Olympics, and Jim Edwards, British owner of an exclusive wildlife lodge in Nepal.
Briton Geoffrey Dobbs sailed the Pacific in a bamboo raft trying to prove the Chinese reached America before Columbus. American Tom Clayton pilots planes around the African bush, carrying two horse polo mallets in the back of his Cessna 180.
While elephant polo could be regarded as a macho pursuit, it's usually injury-free as long as one stays firmly strapped in the rope harness and doesn't argue with the referee, who always sits atop the biggest beast on the field. In our game it was Plai Kampheng, a titanic tusker weighing at least 31/2 tons.
""Thoy, thoy"" - ""Back up"" - was probably the most frequent cry during our contest as the elephant drivers, or mahouts, urged their charges into reverse so we could attempt yet another swing at the ball. Although the mahouts issued vital commands from their perches behind the animals' necks, the elephants seemed to read the game on their own, and get into its spirit.
While we had our moments, a substantial amount of play degenerated into what Kalaan called ""a muddle in the middle,"" a genteel description of what in fact were players thrashing and poking around with 8-foot mallets trying to locate and connect with an object not much larger than a tennis ball under the vast bellies of two or three enmeshed elephants.
After our 1-0 lead, we went into the second and last chukka a bit too cocky, allowing the youthful Thai stars to power their way through our ragged defense and tap three humiliating goals between the posts.
Some of us thought the stars had an unfair advantage with Atithep Chodchoi. This handsome actor had recently spent about a month on elephant back during the filming of an epic about the days when the animals served as battle tanks, and foot soldiers quaked in their sandals at the thunderous approa"
"65",20022086,"Title: Nepalese workers abroad help sustain economy.rtf; Date: October 9, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Remittance money from more than 700,000 Nepalese working abroad, including 3,500 Gurkha soldiers in the British army, is helping to keep the battered Himalayan kingdom's economy afloat, economists say.
""The regular inflow of remittance from Nepalese working in at least 19 countries including in the Gulf, Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe and the United States has largely helped to sustain the Nepalese economy,"" senior economist Prithivi R. Ligal told AFP.
Political turmoil, a Maoist insurgency that has killed nearly 5,000 people in six years and last year's September 11 attacks have left Nepal in the economic doldrums.
The Himalayan kingdom, which is highly dependent on tourism, was plunged into further turmoil Friday when King Gyanendra sacked the caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and suspended elections due to be held next month.
""The ever escalating Maoist terrorism and the political instability in the country and the recession in the international markets after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US have gravely affected Nepal's economy, including its domestic productions, tourism and overseas exports,"" Ligal said.
During the last fiscal year, which ended mid-July 2002, the country's growth rate was 0.87 percent compared with a figure of 4.8 percent the previous year, said Ligal, who is a former vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission.
""Agriculture production was 1.7 percent against the previous year's production of 4.3 percent and non-agriculture production was 0.2 percent against 5.1 percent.
Official remittances of 92.3 million dollars in the last financial year has helped to sustain the economy and foreign exchange reserves, which are at 1.34 billion dollars.
""Had there not been this regular inflow of the cash from abroad the public would have panicked in view of the drastic cut down in the employment of the tourism sector, industrial plants and other private business houses,"" Prakash Rajaurya, a leading Nepalese ready-made garment exporter said.
Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank) governor Tilak Rawal agreed.
""The remittance money sent to the country by the Nepalese people working abroad has greatly helped the nation's economy which currently is facing various complications and difficulties,"" he said.
Many young Nepalis, particularly men, go abroad in search of work because of a lack of job opportunities at home, analyst Katak Bahadur Pandey said.
They also leave because of threats from Maoist rebels who demand villagers give money or manpower to their people's war for a communist republic, he said.
Around 15 percent of the 23.3 million strong population is unemployed in Nepal, but the figure rises to a huge 49 percent during the tourist and agriculture off-seasons, according to former finance minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari.
To help youths in rural areas where there are Maoist threats and a lack of employment, the finance ministry is now giving loans of up to 100,000 rupees (1,282 dollars) to young people who seek jobs oversees.
""In view of the growing problems of mass unemployment, the government has thought it desirable and necessary to send the willing labour force to foreign countries by providing them with necessary financial help,"" an Overseas Employment Organisers official Kshetra Bahadur Gurung said.

At least seven anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot early Tuesday morning in Salyan district, five others were killed in Kanchanpur district, all located in the western Nepal, and another nine were killed in some other districts of the country.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fires with the government security force, the English daily quoted a press release issued by Nepali Defense Ministry late Tuesday night as saying.
Meanwhile, the government security forces also arrested 23 anti- government guerrillas and seized a large cache of arms, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations across the country, the press release said.
More than 900 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed  more than 3, 000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

"71",20021967,"Title: One year after royal massacre, Nepalese still shaking heads.rtf; Date: May 29, 2002 Wednesday; Text: One year after Nepal's royal leadership was massacred during dinner at the palace, the grisly episode remains fresh in the minds of the kingdom's people, many of whom believe their questions about what actually happened may never be fully answered.
On an extraordinary evening that put this isolated Himalayan state at the top of the world's headlines, the king, queen and eight other members of the royal family were gunned down in a shooting spree blamed on the lovesick heir to the throne.
According to the official version of events on June 1, 2001, Dipendra, the chubby, Eton-educated crown prince with a fascination for weapons, unleashed his full arsenal on his family after a night of whisky and hashish, later shooting himself.
Dipendra's fury was said to have been sparked by his parents' refusal to let him marry his girlfriend Devyani Rana, the beautiful daughter of a noble family in India.
The crown prince's first victim was his father, Birendra.
Dipendra had been escorted out of dinner as his behavior grew agitated. He marched back into the palace's billiard room after 9:00 pm and riddled the king with bullets.
After gunning down seven more family members, the prince is believed to have set his sights on his mother, firing at her with such ferocity that her body was unrecognizable afterwards.
He is then said to have shot himself.
Despite the allegation of mass murder, the patricidal prince was crowned the new king, reigning comatose from his hospital bed for two days before dying himself.
Succeeding him was Gyanendra, Birendra's younger brother, who had the good fortune to have left Kathmandu hours before the massacre. He returned to inherit a kingdom shattered by the tragedy and facing an increasing bloody Maoist insurgency with an elected government notorious for its vicious infighting.
While a commission set up by Gyanendra laid the full blame for the massacre on Dipendra, the death behind closed doors of a king who had reigned for nearly three decades still seems incredible to many Nepalese.
""We don't dare to answer the question of who killed the king. Because really, none of us will ever be able to answer that with certainty,"" said Ram Briksha, a brass ornament salesman.
Any conspiracy theories must be taken with a big grain of salt in Nepal, which is so enamoured by rumors that riots once erupted over reports an Indian pop star had bad-mouthed the kingdom.
But from the talk of people on the street, there are plenty of holes to be poked in the official story: How could one gunman mow down nine people at the most tightly guarded building in the country? How could the future queen and crown prince, Komal and Paras, both survive the bloodbath at Narayanhiti Palace? And how could the right-handed Dipendra die from a self-inflicted bullet to the left side of his head?
The most asked question is the most basic: How could a prince groomed from birth to assume the throne of the Shah dynasty suddenly go berserk and kill his own parents at dinner?
A traumatized Devyani Rana -- whose allure was officially cited as the reason Nepal's royal leadership was wiped out -- fled the kingdom immediately after the massacre.
The standard explanation of why she was not permitted to wed the crown prince is that queen Aishwarya was heeding the advice of the influential astrologers, who had advised against the marriage.
He had been in love with Devyani for years. Some say the pressure from his mother and from Devyani, who was several years his senior and feared she was passing child-bearing age, pushed him over the edge.
Another, more controversial, explanation is that the queen did not want her royal son to marry a woman with roots in India, the powerful neighbor whose heavy cultural and political influence is deeply resented by Nepal's elite.
Even if the conspiracy theories are discounted, Gyanendra still has an unenviable task: consolidating power after the sudden assassination of a popular and charismatic leader.
""Everyone loved Birendra. The new king isn't as loved, because we keep hearing reports he could have had a hand in the massacre,"" said Sanjay Shrestha, a high school student.
But amid the widespread suspicions and innuendos, some in Nepal, particularly in officialdom, are ready to accept the royal account of the massacre, if only because there is no evidence to support any other conclusion.
""Sure, you can say it was all one big plot, but then the question is: by whom?"" asked a Kathmandu-based diplomat.
""By the new king? It's hardly some prize to get to run Nepal at a time like this,"" the diplomat said.
""In the end, the official version may very well be the truth.""

The Nepali Congress (NC) is facing the prospect of a damaging split between rival camps after Deuba last week dissolved parliament without consulting his party colleagues.
NC president and former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala suspended Deuba from the party over the matter and has threatened to expel him, which could lead to Deuba setting up a rival party with his supporters
Sunday's talks between Koirala and a founding leader of the NC, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, failed to find a solution to the crisis, a party source said.
Koirala refused Bhattarai's appeals to reconsider any drastic action, the source said.
""The NC president is bent upon expelling the beleaguered caretaker prime minister Deuba from the party which would compel him (Deuba) to form a new party,"" the source said.
""Mr Koirala told Mr Bhattarai that the democratic system in the country was in danger and to save democracy, he was going to take action,"" NC youth leader Prakash Man Singh told AFP.
On Wednesday Deuba asked King Gyanendra to dissolve the 205-member lower house of parliament and announce polls for November 13, two years before parliament's term was due to end in 2004.
Deuba said he was forced to take the drastic step after opposition from his own party to his proposal to extend emergency rule by another six months to control a Maoist rebellion.
Koirala, as well as opposition parties, argued that an extension to the emergency, first introduced in November, was undemocratic and also unnecessary because existing anti-terrorism laws could be used against the rebels.
Last week Koirala urged all of Deuba's ministers to resign in protest. Three of them did, including Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, but the remaining 34 threw their weight behind Deuba.
Koirala also asked Deuba to explain why he had not consulted the NC's executive members over the dissolution.
In his letter of reply Deuba said the dissolution of the parliament was a constitutional right of an elected prime minister.
And he recalled that the same step had been taken by Koirala in 1994 when he asked the then King Birendra to dissolve the house early after infighting within the NC leadership.
The subsequent election returned a hung parliament, leading to a minority government headed by the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML).
In the last election in 1999, the NC secured 113 seats and the NCP-UML 69. Any division in the NC would split its vote and it would lose power, political observers said.
A member of the NC Disciplinary Action Committee told AFP on condition of anonymity that Deuba would most likely be expelled.
""The disciplinary committee is taking its decision against Deuba by expelling him from the party for his deceptive role against the country's democracy.""
But former deputy prime minister Ram Chandra Paudel said last-ditch efforts were being made on to salvage the situation.
""We are making the last-minute efforts to save the Nepali Congress party with the joint efforts of ex-MPs,"" he said.
The emergency gives local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists and impose curfews, measures Deuba's rivals say are draconian and which have not stopped the rebels.
The Maoist rebellion has cost more than 4,000 lives since 1996 -- more than half of them since the guerrillas broke a truce in November last year, which prompted the emergency.

"73",20022522,"Title: Leaders of India , Pakistan headed to regional forum, aiming to avert war.rtf; Date: NA; Text: The leaders of India and Pakistan said they were trying to avert war as they headed to a regional summit Friday, but despite world pressure Indian officials insisted they would not use the gathering to talk peace.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf will meet at the Nepal gathering for the first time since a failed summit in July. However, India's delegation said there will be no one-on-one talks until they are satisfied Pakistan has cracked down on Islamic militants.
Despite an apparent easing of tensions, the armies from the nuclear-armed rivals remain on alert, and violence continued in the disputed province of Kashmir, the catalyst for two wars and the breakdown of their July talks.
Indian and Pakistani troops traded gunfire overnight and Islamic militants in Pakistan reportedly threatened more attacks in Kashmir. Both sides claim the divided Himalayan province in its entirety.
Vajpayee said Thursday that diplomacy could avert another war, and his foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, made India's first positive comments about Pakistan's recent moves against Islamic militant groups based in the country.
The latest round of hostilities erupted after a Dec. 13 suicide attack on India's Parliament that New Delhi blamed on militants based in Pakistan. Indian officials demanded Pakistan arrest the militants' leaders and the nations massed troops along their 1,100-mile border.
""Pakistan wants peace and de-escalation,"" Musharraf said Thursday. But he warned in comments to his military commanders and Cabinet, ""Should a mistake of attacking Pakistan be made, they would regret their decision.""
In China, where he stopped en route to Nepal, Musharraf told Premier Zhu Rongji that Pakistan ""wants to soothe the current tense situation through dialogue,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
Vajpayee also held out hope for a peaceful solution.
""Efforts are being made to avoid war through diplomatic channels. If that succeeds, there will be no need to opt for other alternatives,"" the prime minister told reporters in India before flying to Nepal.
Vajpayee was the first leader to arrive for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which will meet from Friday to Sunday. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Bhutan, Pakistan and Nepal will also attend.
Vajpayee and Singh said there will be no one-on-one meetings with Pakistani officials until they have conducted an effective and sustained crackdown on militants.
A top aide to Vajpayee said ""sparks would fly"" if there were to be a tete-a-tete with Musharraf.
Singh adjusted his previous criticism of Islamabad's crackdown on the Islamic militant groups.
After the United States declared Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed - the two main Pakistan-based militant groups - terrorist organizations, Pakistan froze their assets, arrested their leaders and nearly 50 other members.
Before the arrests, Singh had called the moves ""cosmetic,"" but on Thursday he said they were ""welcome steps in the right direction.""
Pakistan government spokesman Ashfaq Gondal called Singh's remarks ""something positive."" Pakistani officials said they were pleased that both nations are at least attending the summit, where the leaders will be in the same room.
India and Pakistan's latest feud has raised global concerns, even though both governments have committed not to make a first nuclear strike.
In Washington, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the summit ""could be an opportunity for them to seek ways to make progress toward resolving their current differences and reducing tensions.""
British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived in Bangladesh on Thursday for a subcontinent tour that will include meetings with the Indian and Pakistani leaders after the summit.
""I can't solve the Kashmir problem just by coming to India and Pakistan - of course we can't - but I hope by putting strong views on behalf of everybody in the international community, I hope we can have a calming influence,"" Blair said in Bangladesh.
Earlier, hundreds of Islamic protesters marched in the capital, Dhaka, burning black flags to protest Blair's visit and accusing him of teaming up with Washington to kill innocent Muslims in Afghanistan during the war on terrorism.
The meeting between Vajpayee and Musharraf in India in July ended on a sour note because of bitter differences over Kashmir.

The rebels attacked the district's airport as well as Mangalsen, the headquarters of the district, located about 350 kilometers west of Kathmandu, taking control of the city's police post and communications center.
'At least 16 policemen were reported killed in Mangalsen and 22 others at Sanphebagar airport,' the official told Kyodo News, asking not to be named.
In the city, the chief government official of the district as well as the head of the intelligence bureau and his wife were killed, he said.
The rebels blasted the district's government office and looted local banks, he said.
All communications links with the district were down from midnight Saturday, and army reinforcements were trying to reach the district on Sunday, the official said.
There were at least 50 soldiers in the city when the rebel attack took place, and their fate remains unknown, the official said.
The chief district officer of adjoining Doti district confirmed that the rebels had carried out attacks at several government positions in Achham district.
'Here, we had reports of firefights all night,' he told Kyodo News over the telephone.
Meanwhile, the Nepalese Defense Ministry said five rebels were slain at different places by government troops Sunday.

"76",20021046,"Title: India gifts new-look industrial policy to former protectorate.rtf; Date: December 5, 2002 Thursday; Text: India Thursday offered a new-look industrial policy to its fareastern Sikkim state to boost economic activity in the Himalayan territory merged with India in 1975 over opposition from China.
Officials said Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's cabinet offered ten years of excise and income tax exemptions to new industries opening in the former Indian protectorate.
The policy offered incentives to 12 sectors including agriculture, tourism, handicraft, floriculture, mining and to the pharmaceutical industry of cash-starved Sikkim, officials said.
The federal gift came as Sikkim's state government intensified its campaign to press New Delhi to reopen a historic route to Tibet, shut since the region's controversial merger.
Sikkim, sandwiched by Bhutan, China and Nepal, argues the route across Nathu La, India's highest mountain pass at 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) could boost trade and bring Tibetan Buddhists and Indian Hindus closer.
Observers, however, said the concession was aimed to blunt efforts by China to increase its political influence in Sikkim, which Beijing does not recognise as an Indian territory on official Chinese maps.
Despite an elected government in power in the state capital of Gangtok, New Delhi only two years ago allowed tourists to reach Nath La, the site of a massacre of Indian soldiers by the Chinese army 35 years ago.
Sikkim, with a population of 500,000, is one of India's seven far eastern states, called the ""Seven Sisters."" The endearing name is virtually all the region has going for it, however, with no industrial base, poor services and little scope for employment.
India, which fought a brief border war with China in 1962, is also home to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and his 100,000 followers who fled their homeland after Beijing crushed an anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.
Analysts say China, despite its warming ties with India, has yet to reconcile to the 1975 accession by New Delhi of Sikkim, an Indian protectorate since British colonial rulers left the subcontinent in 1947.

About 100 people have died as flood waters continue to rage through some of Europe's historic cities while in Asia, the traditional monsoon season has left hundreds dead and millions more without shelter.
The freak weather has revived concerns that modern civilisation is at fault, with some environmental groups and politicians blaming global climate change -- a charge still fiercely disputed.
The surging Elbe river was bearing down on more German towns on Sunday, crashing through dams at near-record levels as central European leaders met with senior EU officials to discuss the massive rebuilding job that lies ahead.
Outside the town of Wittenberg, best known as the home of Reformation leader Martin Luther, around 40,000 people were evacuated as the Elbe smashed a 20-metre (60-foot) hole through a nearby dam in Pratau.
Emergency workers were busily laying sandbags to staunch the flow of water which has made its way down from Prague, the Czech capital which has been one of the cities hardest hit by the deluge.
Czech authorities ordered more evacuations Sunday in Prague amid fears that more buildings would collapse from the swirling waters of the overflowing Vltava river.
Around 220,000 Czechs were forced out of their homes by the worst floods in more than 100 years.
In Hungary, more than 20,000 people were working to reinforce dykes in anticipation of record flood levels expected to hit Budapest later in the day, the disaster management service said.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder held a summit in Berlin with leaders from Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the European Union to assess the crisis, which in Europe alone is already believed to have caused tens of billions of euros (dollars) in damage.
A source close to the German government said that EU aid could amount to five billion euros for repairs of flood damage in the south and east of the country.
Schroeder was expected to announce the amount of EU assistance on Monday after a government meeting.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) proposed Sunday to the four leaders of the flood-ravaged countries special loans which would cover as much as 100 percent of those projects it funded.
Meanwhile in Asia, China has been one of the countries hardest hit this monsoon season. State media confirmed Sunday that around 250 people had been killed in a fortnight of heavy rains.
In Xinping county in Yunnan province, the toll after rain-induced landslides cut a 50-meter (170-foot) chasm in the side of a mountain has risen to 33 dead and 30 missing.
""I have never seen such a terrible natural disaster in my life,"" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted a 70-year-old woman as saying.
More than 800 people have been killed and millions displaced by floods and landslides in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
In southeast Asia, flash floods ripped through mountainous areas of northern Vietnam this week, killing four, submerging hundreds of homes and destroying vital crops.
In Mexico the death toll has risen to at least 21 people in widespread flooding over the past few days and another 13,000 are homeless, authorities told Reforma and Universal newspapers Sunday.
Forecasters expected more rain, which would complicate efforts to recover from the flooding.
Heavy rains have caused widespread flooding in north-central Mexico, with many of the deaths coming after flood waters inundated dams in the states of Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi.
The catastrophes come just days before some 50,000 delegates gather in Johannesburg for the UN Earth Summit to consider the effects of development on the environment.
Environmental group WWF on Sunday urged European leaders to enact measures to protect against any future flooding.
Meanwhile some politicians have pointed a finger at the United States, whose controversial refusal to adopt the Kyoto protocol on global warming angered many in Europe.
""It must be made clear to the US government at the summit in Johannesburg that its boycott of the Kyoto protocol is unacceptable,"" said Germany's overseas development minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul.
She linked the devastating floods to global climate changes and said they should ""open the eyes of those in the US government"" who deny a relationship between pollution and natural disasters.

Security forces shot and killed four rebel fighters at Kalikot, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) west of Katmandu, Nepal's capital, defense ministry spokesman Bhola Silwal said. Elsewhere in Nepal, eight rebels were killed in overnight gunbattles, Silwal said.
One police officer was also killed Wednesday when the rebels attacked a police post at Dhimuwa, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu, Interior Security Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka said.
In Parliament, lawmakers resumed debate over extending the state of emergency, which was imposed in November, for another three months.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba urged lawmakers to extend the emergency so that the government can crush the rebellion using the army.
The three-month national emergency was imposed Nov. 26 after the rebels abruptly ended peace talks and resumed fighting government forces.
Khadka said that security in Achham district, where Maoist rebels had killed 137 people over the weekend, has been beefed up.
""The government is working to bring back life to normal in the area and a new chief district officer will be dispatched to the area soon to take control of the situation,"" Khadka said.
The army has sealed off the area and intensified its search for the rebels.
In the weekend attack at Mangalsen, 600 kilometers (375 miles) to the northwest of Katmandu, 77 police officers, 55 army soldiers, an intelligence officer and four civilians were killed.
The attack was the deadliest since the rebels began fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996.
Khadka said security forces have recovered 13 bodies of the rebels from the area and quoted eyewitnesses as seeing many rebel fighters taking away the bodies of their fallen fighters.
More than 2,400 people have died since the rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, began fighting in 1996.
The army says it has killed nearly 500 guerrillas and arrested another 1,400 since the state of emergency was declared in November. Authorities say more than 300 soldiers and officers also have died.
The rebels have called a general strike on Friday and Saturday across Nepal to commemorate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency campaign.

The student group has called a strike Tuesday and Wednesday at all schools around the kingdom to press for a removal of tuition fees and other demands.
The government has promised to ensure security for the kingdom's five million students but most institutions will close as a precaution, said Madhav Adhikari, president of Nepal Teachers Organization, the union for some 75,000 educators.
""Government security is there, but they can't protect everywhere. The Maoists may do anything to further their political propaganda,"" he said.
The Maoists have been waging a six-and-a-half-year ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy, in an insurgency that has claimed more than 4,900 lives.
The All-Nepal Free Nationalist Student Union (Revolutionary) called the strike and made 13 demands, including free education at all schools, including those that are privately run, and an end to a crackdown on teachers who do not have government accreditation.
Nepal recently said it would suspend uncertified teachers after reports that thousands of educators may have fake credentials.
The student group is also demanding a ban on Indian teachers and instruction of Hinduism's holy language Sanskrit, whose instruction is generally associated with higher castes.
The Maoists are staunchly anti-Indian, accusing the giant neighbor of trying to control Nepal's political, economic and cultural affairs.

The seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will include in their declaration at the end of the summit Sunday their backing for the September resolution of the United Nations Security Council.
SAARC diplomats said leaders are likely to set up a committee to go into the implementation of the anti-terrorism resolution that seeks the freezing of assets of foreign terrorist organisations.
""SAARC will symbolically back the UN resolution at their summit here even though they have generally accepted the security council resolution made after the September 11 attacks in the United States,"" a top SAARC diplomat said.
He said a high-level meeting of SAARC member states could take place in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, most probably by April, to agree on mechanisms to implement the UN anti-terrorism resolution and regulations in the region.
Terrorism has emerged as a key subject for SAARC which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the backdrop of September 11 and cross-border violence in the region.
SAARC adopted its own anti-terrorism charter during the third summit of the regional body in 1987 here in Kathmandu, but diplomats said it has remained largely unimplemented.
""The SAARC convention against terrorism allows the extradition of suspects and the freezing of assets of terror groups,"" a SAARC legal expert said. ""But political tensions, particularly between India and Pakistan have stalled it.""
However, India is keen that the regional body now pay more attention to the subject, amid its allegations that neighbouring Pakistan is sponsoring cross border terrorism.
The SAARC convention was adopted in 1987 against the backdrop of Sri Lankan charges that India was arming and training Tamil separatists to carry out attacks in the island republic.
SAARC diplomats said member states have not enacted legislation at home to give effect to the regional anti-terrorism convention which remains buried under a pile of platitudes.

""If the SAARC summit is held, the Prime Minister will definitely attend it,"" Sinha said, referring to the annual heads of state meeting of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation.
""But the summit should have an objective and it should not be just to see each other's faces,"" Sinha told reporters in New Delhi.
Claiming there had been no progress in the SAARC grouping due to Pakistan's ""rigid stand"" at this year's Kathmandu summit, Sinha said ""if there is no progress, there is no no point in holding the summit.""
Earlier, Indian junior foreign minister Digvijay Singh was emphatic that Vajpayee would be heading to Pakistan in Jauary.
""The Indian prime minister will go to Pakistan for the SAARC summit next year,"" Singh told Aaj Tak television.
""He is going there for the SAARC summit, not for the bilateral process. Heads of state of all SAARC countries will be there.""
SAARC holds an annual summit of heads of state and government, but the meetings have often been scuttled by bickering between India and Pakistan.
Singh said Vajpayee's proposed attendance of the SAARC summit in Islamabad was another ""indication that we (India) want(s) peace in the region.""
When asked if the visit would help open a new chapter in bilateral relations between India and Pakistan, he said: ""SAARC is a multilateral forum, where bilateral issues are not discussed.
""As far as I understand, the prime minister's visit will be to participate in the summit and it does not have anything to do with Pakistan except that the summit is taking place there,"" Singh said.
Vajpayee and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf both attended the SAARC summit in January in Nepal's capital Kathmandu, but held no bilateral talks on the sidelines of the meeting.
Musharraf, however, made a grand show of shaking hands with Vajpayee, much to the latter's obvious discomfort.
When another regional summit -- in the Kazakhstan capital Almaty -- came around in June, India and Pakistan were lurching towards all-out war over an Islamic rebellion in Indian Kashmir which New Delhi claims is backed by Islamabad.
While both Vajpayee and Musharraf attended the meeting, they studiously avoided each other and attempts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to persuade them to meet face-to-face came to naught.
The junior foreign minister's statement comes a day after India announced it would withdraw troops deployed for 10 months on its frontiers with Pakistan.
In a major step toward de-escalating tensions in nuclear-armed South Asia, Defence Minister George Fernandes said Wednesday the Indian forces had been ""asked to redeploy from positions on the international border with Pakistan, without impairing their capacity to respond decisively to any emergency.""
But he added: ""There will be no lowering of the vigil in Jammu and Kashmir,"" giving the formal name for the Indian state.
India has about 700,000 troops deployed at its shared borders with Pakistan. The standoff was triggered by a December 13 attack on India's parliament by gunmen New Delhi claims were sponsored by Islamabad.
The rivals have come to the brink of another war after a series of massacres in Kashmir, including attacks on a slum and an army residential camp in the state.
India in May withdrew its warships from forward locations in the Arabian Sea and later lifted a ban on Pakistani planes flying over its territory, a move which has not been reciprocated by Islamabad.

Officials had previously said the court would order British-born Islamic militant Sheikh Omar into judicial custody as a first step toward a murder case.
But Raja Qureshi, advocate general of the southern Sindh province, told reporters a judge had ordered a new 14-day police remand for Omar ""on the basis that the investigation agencies have to recover the dead body and further evidence.""
He said the additional remand was made possible by a new anti-terrorism law in Pakistan, whose President Pervez Musharraf vowed to ""liquidate terrorists"" after the Wall Street Journal correspondent's killing.
Hundreds of police were deployed around the court in the southern city of Karachi as Omar, a 29-year-old former student at the London School of Economics, was taken out of an armed personnel carrier with a cloth covering his face.
He was joined by two men accused of sending e-mails of Pearl in captivity, Salman Saquib and former police intelligence officer Sheikh Adil, who were also remanded for another two weeks.
A third alleged e-mailer, Fahad Naseem, has already been sent to judicial custody.
Naseem's lawyer said Omar told the closed-room court he did not want to ""make any confessional statement.""
On his last court appearance on February 14, Omar admitted to masterminding Pearl's abduction and said the reporter was dead.
The lawyer, Khawaja Naveed, said Omar complained that police had been trying to force him to confess by signing a blank paper. The judge directed police ""that the accused should not be pressurized and signatures should not be obtained on blank papers,"" according to Naveed.
But Qureshi said Omar made no statement in court. He said the judge asked the defendants whether they were maltreated in police custody and ""none of them complained.""
The brief court appearance came as US officials said in Washington that a grand jury was asked even before Pearl's abduction to look into evidence against Omar, who spent more than five years in an Indian jail for kidnapping three British and one American tourist.
Omar was released in exchange for passengers of an Indian Airlines flight hijacked in December 1999 from Nepal to Afghanistan. He was detained earlier this month in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the US administration is making plans to convene a federal grand jury to issue indictments in the slaying of the newspaper's Bombay-based correspondent.
Pearl's beheading, shown in a graphic videotape whose existence was made public Thursday, sparked outrage around the world, with the United States and Pakistan vowing to bring the killers to justice.
But since news of the killing surfaced late Thursday, Pakistani authorities are not known to have made any arrests. They detained for questioning a journalist who delivered the videotape to the US consulate.
A senior investigator said police had as evidence the videotape, along with a laptop, a computer disc and a scanner used in the e-mails.
""The further remand will help us in the search for the body of the abductee and recovery of the weapon used in the murder,"" the investigator said.
Naveed said police told the court Monday they were seeking five ""absconding accused,"" among them Amjad Hussain Farooqi, an Islamic militant investigators believe drove Pearl from a Karachi hotel on his way to captivity and eventual death.
The slaying was a major embarrassment for Musharraf, who has been lavishly praised by the United States for helping its military campaign in Afghanistan and for his pledges to modernize Pakistan.
Musharraf has acknowledged Pearl's kidnapping may have been part of a backlash against a crackdown on Islamic extremism he announced in a January 12 speech.
The brother of accused e-mailer Sheikh Adil blasted Musharraf's crackdown, saying it was ""because of US pressure."" He said his brother knew Sheikh Omar from Afghanistan but was not involved in Pearl's abduction or killing.
""It is still not clear who kidnapped him (Pearl). How can they be charged?"" said Mohammad Aslam, who added that all of Adil's 11 brothers believed ""jihad,"" or holy war, was ""a religious duty.""
The Pakistani news agency that received the video of Pearl's slaying said Friday that Pearl was killed after he read a statement saying he was Jewish and that Muslims were being ""oppressed"" in several parts of the world.
Pearl's widow, Mariane, who is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child, said her husband was forced to read the statement before being ""stabbed in the most cruel and cowardly manner"".

Marking World Tourism Day, all foreigners arriving at Kathmandu's airport were garlanded, and those arriving alone were given rides to their hotels.
And the tourists were invited in the evening for a traditional feast, known as a bhoj, at the Hanuman Dhoka, a 17th-century palace in central Kathmandu that is the ancestral home of the ruling Shah dynasty.
The feast, served on plates of eight leaves stitched together by bamboo sticks, will include foods native to the ethnic Newar community, including steamed rice, chicken, mutton, fruit, yogurt and rice liquor.
Officials said they expected more than 1,200 tourists to join the feast, along with a similar number of Nepalese hosts. Kathmandu and two neighboring municipalities are financing the dinner along with a number of public cultural programs.
Tourism, the top foreign currency earner in the Himalayan kingdom, has nosedived since a June 2001 massacre of the royal family and a subsequent surge in a Maoist insurgency, which has claimed more than 4,900 lives since 1996.
More than 250,000 people in Nepal are directly employed by tourism, with another one million in jobs dependent on tourism, such as mountaineering.
Tourism Minister Bal Bahadur KC, who will attend the dinner, called on all Nepalese to help ""develop Nepal into an attractive and reliable tourism destination.""
""Promotion of tourism, mainly in a developing country like ours, will help in a big way in reducing poverty, providing employment opportunities at the local level, reducing regional imbalances and creating environmental awareness,"" he said.

The deadly offensive came days before the Himalayan kingdom's prime minister is due in Washington to appeal for military support to quash the uprising, which has sharply intensified in recent months.
Army troops were combing the Lisne area of Rolpa, some 298 kilometres (184 miles) west of Kathmandu, when they were ambushed Thursday by Maoists, state minister for home affairs Devendra Raj Kandel said.
""Security personnel took retaliatory action against the Maoist terrorists by attacking their training camp, where they found arms looted from barracks,"" Kandel told AFP.
A home ministry official said more than 100 rebels were killed in Rolpa, where the Maoists in 1996 launched their ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy.
A member of parliament told AFP the Maoists had been holding a district-level meeting at the guerrilla camp when army helicopters began to pound them and that the death toll could be still higher.
Another 40 rebels died when the army attacked a training camp at Boktang in Doti district, 398 kilometres (246 miles) west of Kathmandu, the defense ministry said in a statement.
Troops were Friday recovering the rebels' scattered bodies and have so far taken away 65, the home ministry official said. Military helicopters were hovering over the battle sites in case the Maoists launched a counter-offensive, he said.
The Nepali-language daily Kantipur added one soldier was killed and three other personnel, a soldier and two policemen, were seriously wounded. But officials said they could not confirm any government casualties.
The assault is one of the deadliest battles in the Maoists' six-year uprising. The defense ministry said that on Wednesday another 22 rebels were killed in clashes around the kingdom.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is due Tuesday to make the first visit by a Nepalese premier to the White House, where he will discuss with President George W. Bush ways to quell the Maoist insurgency, which has left more than 3,200 people dead.
The Bush administration has already asked Congress to approve 20 million dollars in military aid to Nepal.
The Maoists, who are staunchly anti-American, exert de facto control in parts of Nepal's impoverished countryside, where they have promised radical redistribution of wealth.
The Maoist leadership Thursday appealed for unconditional talks to end the rebellion, saying dialogue was needed ""to avoid foreign army intervention"" in the Himalayan state.
But Deuba insisted again Friday there could be no peace talks until the rebels lay down their weapons.
""The Maoists are killing innocent people, looting food for the poor people and destroying public utilities. There is no question of holding talks with such elements unless they surrender their arms,"" Deuba told a ruling party function.
""We are receiving support from all friendly countries and the army is operating to suppress the Maoists. We are fully confident we can smash them,"" he said.
Three rounds of talks initiated last year by Deuba ended in stalemate, with the government refusing Maoist demands to scrap the monarchy. The rebels broke a four-month ceasefire in November with a string of bloody attacks on the police and army.
The Maoists called a general strike last month to press their demands for talks and in early April launched their most lethal assault yet, leaving at least 164 people dead in raids on police posts in southwestern Nepal.
But internal differences have also emerged between Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachand, who favors dialogue with the government, and a faction led by Ram Bahadura Thapa, alias Badal, who believes the monarchy must be defeated by force.
Government officials said a bag was found Wednesday in the northwestern Seti river with the heads of 40 rebels apparently killed in a clash between Maoist factions.

It said the guerrillas were shot dead in four separate battles Friday but gave no further detail.
The radio, quoting defense officials, did not report any casualties on the government side.
Officials estimate more than 4,200 people have died in Nepal since the Maoists launched a ""people's war"" in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy.
More than half of the deaths have been reported since the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with the government in late November, prompting King Gyanendra to deploy the army against the rebels for the first time.
On the six-month anniversary of the deployment, the army has been trying to show the public its success by displaying an array of arms and ammunition seized from the rebels.
Thousands of residents lined up Saturday to see the weaponry at the Tundikhel ceremonial parade grounds, in front of the army headquarters in Kathmandu.
The large crowd for the exhibition, which continues Sunday, blocked traffic in the area for hours. The display was inaugurated Friday by caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other officials.
The army says that since its deployment security forces have confiscated 825 kilograms (1,815 pounds) of explosives, 24,449 rounds of ammunition and 2,686 rifles, machine-guns, pistols, revolvers and other guns.

The explosion occurred at 5:30 a.m. at a traffic crossing in the Kalimamti area of western Kathmandu, the police said.
The blast destroyed a statue of late King Mahendra, the father of the present monarch King Gyanendra, placed at the crossing.
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast but police suspect Maoist rebels waging an armed insurgency in the kingdom to be behind it.
Quoting eyewitnesses, police said four to five people had been seen planting the bomb at the statue in the early hours of Saturday.
The rebels of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) took up arms against the government forces in 1996 to topple constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy in Nepal.
The blast at the late king's statue came one day after King Gyanendra appointed former premier Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the pro-monarchist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party as the country's new prime minister.
The king last week dismissed then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress Party (Democratic) party and his cabinet, and temporarily assumed executive powers after Deuba sought a postponement of parliamentary elections that had been set for Nov. 13.

The guerrillas broke the four-month-long ceasefire talks with the government on November 23 and killed about 100 police and security personnel in well-coordinated massive attacks across the country.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas in August this year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 2, 200 lives, mostly policemen and guerrillas members, since it began in the Himalayan Kingdom in 1996.
However, the talks broke down as the government rejected the guerrillas' demands to establish a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution.

Municipal officials in Poonch, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of Jammu, said the heavy mortar attack began at 10:00 am (0430 GMT) and was continuing.
""At least three villages are being fired upon from across the border,"" Manjit Kaur, an official from the office of Poonch's chief adminstrator, told AFP.
""The firing is very heavy and the situation here is tense,"" Kaur said.
There were no immediate reports of any casualities or damage.
The attack came just minutes before the opening of a South Asian regional summit in Nepal, attended by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.
India and Pakistan have massed troops on their border in the wake of last month's attack on the Indian parliament which India has blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups.
Poonch residents reported heavy mortar shelling in the villages of Degwar, Kharlkarmara and Gulpur and said civilians were fleeing the area.
Indian army posts in the villages under attack were retaliating with mortar and other weapons, they added.
Saturday's fighting in Poonch broke a 24-hour lull in border clashes in the district, which earlier this week saw a fresh exodus of around 5,000 people from their frontier homes.
Indian army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel H.S. Oberoi also reported similar fighting in the district of Rajouri, adjoining Poonch, and said Indian forces had destroyed up to eight Pakistani bunkers killing around four soldiers across the border.
""There were no casualties on our side,"" Oberoi asserted. His claim was impossible to verify as Indian frontier military sectors are now out of bounds to journalists in Kashmir.
Indian troops fired up to 50 shells from grenade launchers overnight in Akhnoor, 35 kilometres (22 miles) from Jammu, an official from India's paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF) said.
""We fired after Pakistan targetted us with mortars and small arms fire,"" said the BSF official on condition of anonymity.
In his speech to the South Assian summit in Kathmandu, Musharraf said he would like to ""extend a hand of genuine friendship with the prime minister of India"" and walked over to Vajpayee's seat to shake his hand.

The emergency, which was imposed to combat the Maoist rebellion, had given authorities the power to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected guerrillas.

Vajpayee was greeted at the airport by Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and held talks with the premier at his official residence after a visit to a famous Hindu temple, Indian embassy sources said.
Later Friday, Vajpayee will have a private dinner with King Gyanendra at the royal palace, they said.
The king was also expected to receive Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The two leaders are in Nepal for the long-delayed summit of the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which is expected to be dominated by tension between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan.
India is Nepal's key trade partner and supplier of military assistance and New Delhi has supported the Deuba government's crackdown on Maoist rebels, who are seeking to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and are staunchly anti-Indian.
India has supplied Nepal with at least two helicopters and arms after the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with the government on November 24.
Vajpayee is also expected to talk to the Nepalese officials about a bilateral trade treaty that was due to expire December 5 but which India extended by three months as a sign of support for the insurgency-rocked kingdom.
Nepal imported 613 million dollars worth of Indian goods in the fiscal year that ended in July 2001, while its exports to India were worth 279 million dollars.

A statement issued in the name of Maoist chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachand, and his second in command, Baburam Bhattarai, and faxed to local dailies announced the three-day strike between November 11 and 13.
The polls were called by caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba two years ahead of schedule after parliament was suddenly dissolved in May.
Critics have said a free election will be nearly impossible when much of the country is under the control of the Maoists, who are fighting to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and other areas are under the tight watch of security forces.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and their bloody insurgency has so far claimed over 4,700 lives.
In their call for a general strike, the Maoist leaders reiterated their desire for political dialogue with the government.
""Dialogue is the only way out at a time when the country is on a threshold of regression and counter-regression,"" said the statement.
The rebel leaders also called for a round table meeting of all political parties in the country.
In an interview with AFP on Friday, Deuba said dialogue with the Maoists was possible ""if they are sincere"" and do not try to compromise parliamentary democracy and the status of the monarchy.

The code stipulates, among other things, that no weapons may be delivered to countries which spend more on arms than social affairs.
At the same time, the new legislation gives the parliament more say over weapons exports.
Under the new legislation, members of parliament will receive a report every four months on arms licenses that have been granted.  Currently this happens only once every year.
It also says that if there is any doubt about the final destination of the order, a team of observers can be sent to that destination.
The new move follows a recent political crisis over the granting of an arms export license to a Belgian company to send machine guns to Nepal. The crisis led to the resignation of a government minister.
Under Belgian laws, the government cannot grant sale of arms to countries which are experiencing a civil war. Many Belgians hold that the internal conflict in Nepal is a civil war, opposing the government's scheduled sale of guns to the Asian country.

More than 100 officers ringed the office of an umbrella group of Kashmiri political and religious leaders where Malik, leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, was holding a news conference. The JKLF is a former militant group that laid down its arms and became a political party.
Police lobbed tear gas at some 60 of Malik's supporters when they tried to prevent them from taking him away in a van in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
More than a dozen militant groups have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir's independence or its merger with Islamic Pakistan. Hindu India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the mainly Muslim Himalayan province.
On Sunday, police Director-General Ashok Suri said a woman, identified only as Shazia, told investigators she had been given the cash in Nepal's capital, Katmandu, by Altaf Qadri, a Kashmiri leader based in Pakistan-held Kashmir. She said Qadri asked her to deliver the cash to Malik.
Shazia was arrested in a random check on the highway leading to Kashmir at Kud, about 60 miles north of Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital.
Malik denied that the money was intended for him as he was being led into the police van on Monday.
Malik was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and the Foreign Exchange Movement Act, said K. Rajendra Kumar, another inspector general of police. Police say the money was allegedly brought in the country illegally.

"105",20021022,"Title: Rebels attack police post in Nepal killing 48 policemen.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Hundreds of rebels attacked a police station in a remote mountainous village on Sunday, killing at least 48 policemen and wounding 19, a government minister said.
There were 70 policemen stationed at the post in the village of Bhiman when the rebels attacked after midnight, starting a battle that lasted for hours, Home Minister Devendra Raj Kadel said after a visit to the site.
The remaining three policemen were missing and may be hiding in the nearby jungle, Kadel said. At least two rebels were killed, he said.
Communications to the post, about 100 miles southeast of the capital, Katmandu, were knocked out soon after the three-hour assault began, he said.
Although the post was only about 12 miles from the district headquarters, government reinforcements only reached the village by morning because rebels blocked the roads, a police official said on condition of anonymity.
The bodies of two rebels were found, but Kadel said the rebel death toll could be much higher. ""We have eyewitnesses saying that the rebels were seen fleeing the scene with dozens of bodies,"" he said.
The insurgents, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy since 1996. The government says nearly 5,000 people, including 3,290 rebels, have been killed in the six years of fighting, mostly in the countryside.
The latest attack comes ahead of a general strike called by the rebels for Sept. 16.
Fighting intensified following the failure of peace talks between the government and the rebels in October. The following month, the constitutional monarch, King Gyanendra, imposed emergency rule.
The state of emergency gave security forces sweeping powers to detain people without trial and curbed civil liberties. It also allowed the army to help police for the first time in fighting the rebels.
It was only lifted last month after opposition politicians expressed concerns it could hinder parliamentary elections in November.

The incident happened early Sunday near the village of Karkare in the Sindhuli district, 90 kilometres (56 miles) east of Kathmandu, state-run radio said.
""Five people were killed and 14 injured, eight seriously,"" it said, adding the wounded had been brought to Kathmandu for treatment.
The dead included a bus cleaner, a security official and a passenger, the radio said. It was not clear how many people had been on board the bus at the time of the blast.
The radio said Maoist rebels were believed to have planted the mine. Maoist guerrillas have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed more than 7,300 lives.
Meanwhile a human rights group Sunday denounced the killing of nine villagers by the army during an anti-Maoist operation.
The Human Rights and Peace Society said they had been killed on December 4 in Laxmipur village in the western Dang district while they were taking part in an annual nightlong harvest festival.
""The army suddenly started firing at the crowd assembled to take part in the festival. Instead the army could have apprehended anyone suspected of being a Maoist,"" it said in a statement.

At least five anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot in Kanchanpur district, in far western Nepal, while four others were killed in Bardiya district and another five were killed in some other districts, all located in the west part of the country.
The guerrillas were killed on Sunday night when they exchanged fires with the government security forces, the press release said.
Meanwhile, the security forces also seized a large cache of arms, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations across the country, it added.
More than 900 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year- long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 3,000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

Unidentified militants triggered a remote controlled bomb late Wednesday in the heart of Manipur city killing three civilians and critically injuring seven more, said a police spokesman in Imphal, capital of insurgency-torn Manipur state.
""The militants were targeting a security vehicle but a public vehicle bore the brunt killing three and wounding seven passengers,"" he said.
Polling in 20 assembly seats in the hill districts of the state began at 7 a.m. (0130 GMT), an election official said.
More than 80 percent turnout was recorded in the first phase of elections for Manipur's other 20 assembly seats on February 14.
The run up to the staggered polls in a state ravaged by scores of separatist movements was marked by a string of rebel attacks in which at least nine people died, including four paramilitary troopers and two poll officials.
On Wednesday, militants ambushed a vehicle carrying election officials in Senapati district killing three and wounding 12.
An estimated 30,000 army, police, and paramilitary troops have taken positions across the 20 constituencies to curb poll violence.
""Some areas are so remote and inaccessible that troop deployment has become a real challenge and the underground groups might try and take advantage of the situation,"" said Manipur state police chief A.A. Siddiqui.
Militants in the past fortnight have also attacked the houses of several former legislators and chief ministers.
""There has been reports of militants snatching away poll materials and ballot boxes from at least three centers in Senapati district,"" police said.
Militants in the past two days also kidnapped at least 12 polling officers.
In the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, considered the most crucial battleground for the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party, the last leg of polling also began Thursday amid tight security.
The fate of as many as 2,500 candidates will be decided, including that of beleagured BJP Chief Minister Rajnath Singh who is facing a anti-establishment backlash.
Opinion polls, while ruling out a return to power by the BJP on its own, have not ruled out the possibility of the party forming a government with the help of friendly parties.
The elections are crucial to the federal coalition of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee as they are seen as a litmus test of Vajpayee's performance.
Thursday's polls cover 166 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh where an estimated 40 million voters will cast their ballots at 48,000 polling centres.
Around 20,000 of these have been declared ""sensitive"" and 350,000 police and paramilitary troops have been deployed. The borders with Nepal to the north have also been sealed.
This will also be the first election where electronic voting machines are used in the state rather than paper ballots.
Elections in the first and second phases for 92 and 145 constituencies respectively were held on February 14 and 18 .
The counting of votes will take place on February 24.

The budget for the fiscal year starting July 15 includes 387.9 million rupees (five million dollars) for the palace, up from 116.3 million rupees in 2001-2002, according to the text made available Tuesday.
Official sources said the added expenditure was likely due to the costs of the coronation of King Gyanendra and extra security for the monarch, who ascended the throne after his brother king Birendra was murdered June 1, 2001.
Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were killed at the palace by a drunken crown prince Dipendra, who later turned the gun on himself. An official report said the 29-year-old prince had been aggravated by his parents' objections to his desired fiancee.
The 1.2 billion-dollar budget for 2002-2003, unveiled Monday by caretaker Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, includes 173 million dollars in defense spending, up from 145 million the year before.
The budget has already been approved by the king, who in May disbanded parliament on Deuba's advice as the house looked set to end emergency powers given to authorities to combat Maoist rebels.
Statistics released just before the budget presentation said the kingdom's growth has been stymied by the Maoist insurgency and the aftershocks of the September 11 attacks in the United States. Per capita income sank to 226 dollars, from 240 in the previous fiscal year.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, the state minister for finance, Bharat Kumar Shah, said the budget was also devoting 500 million rupees (6.4 million dollars) for reconstruction after the Maoist uprising.
The Maoists, whose power is concentrated in the rural west of the kingdom, regularly destroy public buildings, utilities and any other targets associated with the Kathmandu government.
The government says Maoist attacks have cost more than 4,300 lives and 250 million dollars in damage to civilian infrastructure.
Separately, Shah said the government was starting a special 10-year visa for foreigners of Nepalese origin who wish to invest in the kingdom.

The kidnappings occurred Friday after the victims' bus was stopped by suspected guerrillas in Jaluki, a village in western Nepal controlled by the insurgents.
Jaluki is nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
""The Embassy is deeply concerned by this action against a British charity and its staff and asks that Purna Bahadur Shahi be released immediately,"" the embassy said.
Shahi was associated with the Gurkha Welfare Scheme, a British charity helping the Gurkha veterans of the British army.
Gurkhas from Nepal began serving the British Crown in 1815 in India, and with Indian independence in 1947 became part of the British Army. Nearly 3,600 serve now, and in recent years they have taken part in British operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone.
Fighting between government forces and rebels has intensified in recent months after the failure of peace talks in October.
King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency in November after the rebels ended a cease-fire and resumed attacks on government troops.
The army joined police in a campaign to root out the Maoist fighters from their strongholds in remote mountainous areas.
More than 4,000 people have been killed since 1996, when the rebels began fighting to abolish the constitutional monarchy. The insurgents draw their inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong.

'A firefight ensued between the joint security and the armed rebels following the attack and is still continuing,' the Defense Ministry said in its daily statement.
The ministry made no mention of loss of life in the attack on the base in Gam village in the rebels' western stronghold of Rolpa district, about 400 kilometers west of the capital Kathmandu.
Earlier reports said the rebels inflicted heavy losses on the government side, and according to one army officer at least 100 soldiers and policemen were killed.
The rebels are using automatic weapons stolen from police posts and army barracks, the statement said.
The attack came as government troops stepped up a search and destruction operation directed at a rebel shelter in Lisne in the mountainous district, the ministry said.
Communication links with the area have been cut off since midnight Tuesday and adverse weather has prevented rescue helicopters
carrying reinforcements from landing, a private radio station said.
The fate of some 200 policemen and soldiers at Gam camp remains unknown, Kantipur FM reported.
Also overnight at least four policemen were killed and several others wounded when the rebels raided an armed police camp in the eastern part of the Himalayan kingdom, a senior police official said Wednesday.
At least seven rebels were killed in the fighting that followed the attack in Chainpur of Sankhuwasabha district, Pradip Shumsher Rana said.
'We recovered seven bodies of the rebels from the site and many more are believed to have fallen,' the police official said.
Some 150 policemen manned the camp and fought back, inflicting heavy losses on the rebel side, he said.
The rebels also blew up six government offices of the district, which is about 400 km east of the capital Kathmandu.
The rebels, drawing their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy in the Himalayan kingdom.
Nearly 4,000 Nepalese including police, soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed in the insurgency so far.

The grim exception is Vietnam where the Asian elephant population, both wild and in captivity, is less than 100.
""Vietnam is the worst case scenario,"" said Hunter Weiler, an advisor to the Community Wildlife Ranger Program. ""There is an argument they are already biologically doomed because there are so few of them left there.""
Raman Sukumur, from the Centre for Ecological Sciences in India, said there were between 35,000 and 45,000 Asian elephants left in the wild with 50 to 60 percent of them in India.
""Personally, I'm optimistic, I think the wild elephant will survive in Asia but in smaller numbers,"" he said.
Poaching for ivory and meat, and conflict with humans wanting to protect crops or seeking retribution for elephant attacks were the biggest dangers.
Between 1980 and 2001, 900 people were killed by rampaging elephants in India's northeastern Assam state.
In Assam last year, 30 elephants were poisoned to death after a tusker killed a villager, another seven were electrocuted by falling power lines. Train accidents and oil rig pollution were also taking a toll.
Delegates from 13 Asian countries are in Phnom Penh for a four-day conference to devise a strategy to secure the future of the Asian elephant in the wild.
Cambodia-based Weiler said Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Bhutan still have solid herds while Bangladesh was coming under pressure with increasing conflict between man and elephant.
In Southeast Asia, numbers in Indonesia had improved, and Thailand was solid while in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, the wild elephant population was falling but the rate could be controlled.
""Vietnam is the problem, they have to take a very strong management strategy immediately. There are more wild elephants in southern China than in Vietnam and that was a surprising figure to learn.""
Tring Viet Cuong, from Vietnam's Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources said there were between 76 and 94 elephants left in Vietnam's wild where less than 10 percent of land remains as closed tropical forests.
He said there were almost no elephants left in northern Vietnam while small herds remain isolated in the central and southern regions where barriers to human settlements still exist.
""Without urgent action, in terms of on the ground conservation, the species faces extinction,"" he said.

Some in the Indian government, however, labelled the verdict as ""poetic justice.""
""He has been for very long involved in violence, crime and terrorist acts. He spent time in Indian prisons for this very reason,"" Indian foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said in New Delhi.
A Pakistani court in the city of Hyderabad sentenced Sheikh Omar to death by hanging and ordered life sentences on three of his accomplices for abducting and murdering Bombay-based Pearl this year.
Omar, a London-educated son of a prosperous Pakistani garment merchant, was held in the Indian capital's federal Tihar Prison for six years without being charged after he was arrested by the Delhi police for the abduction of an American and three Britons in 1993.
India swapped Omar and two other jailed Islamic militants for 130 passengers and crew of an Indian Airlines plane which was hijacked on December 24, 1999 while it was flying to New Delhi from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu.
The flight was commandeered to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar where the swap took place after a week of tough negotiations whittled down from 36 to three the number of Islamic militants the hijackers wanted India to release from its prisons.
Tihar prison chief Ajay Aggarwal appeared satisfied with the verdict of the Pakistani court, which also imposed fines on the four convicts.
""He should have been hanged much earlier,"" Aggarwal told AFP.
Aggarwal added that he had never spoken to Omar when he was locked up in Tihar, one of Asia's most notorious prisons, which also holds a large number of Islamic and Sikh separatist rebels from the Indian northern states of Kashmir and Punjab.
""I never met him or spoke to him while he was in my custody,"" he said.
Officials from India's home ministry, which is in charge of the country's domestic security, too were satisfied by the capital punishment to Omar, a resident of the Pakistani city of Lahore.
""We can describe the judgement as poetic justice. If Omar Sheikh had remained with us, then perhaps he would have gone down maximum with a life sentence for the 1993 abductions -- which is just 14 years,"" said a ministry official of the 1973-born Omar.
Indian spokeswoman Rao appeared to echo the sentiments of the official of the ministry, which is also in charge of putting down cross-border militancy in Indian Kashmir.
""Had it not been for the Indian Airlines hijacking, he would have stayed in an Indian prison,"" said Rao.
Omar came into contact with Pearl, the Wall Street Journal's South Asia correspondent, when he was delving into the murky underworld of Pakistani militant groups in December and January.
All the four convicts were fined 500,000 rupees (8,330 dollars) which they were ordered to pay to Pearl's widow and her baby son, whom she gave birth to in May.
Omar's name does not appear on a list of 20 most-wanted Muslim militants and criminals India says are sheltering in neighbouring Pakistan. New Delhi has linked any peace dialogue with Islamabad to the handing over of the 20 men.

The attacks came days after rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians in the deadliest assault in their six-year insurrection.
Thursday night, the rebels attacked the police post at Sitalpati, about 250 miles west of Katmandu.
The two sides exchanged gunfire into Friday morning, police told The Associated Press on customary condition of anonymity. Details about the incident were sketchy because authorities lost communication with the police post overnight.
The battle came a day after the army killed at least 48 rebels in the Achham and Doti districts, about 375 miles northwest of Katmandu.
Rebels bombed the bus as it drove through Bhandara, about 100 miles south of the capital, Katmandu. The bus was heading out of Katmandu toward the southern border town of Birgunj, defying a rebel call for a nationwide general strike Friday and Saturday.
Meanwhile, most shops and businesses downed their shutters in the capital after the rebels called the strike to celebrate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency.
Most buses and taxis stayed off the road. Some government and private vehicles ran their routes, but many government workers were forced to walk to their offices.
Police and army forces patrolled the streets as security was beefed up to avoid a rebel strike in the capital.
On Thursday, Nepal's Parliament extended the state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom by another three months.
The emergency was imposed Nov. 26 after rebels abruptly broke off peace talks and resumed fighting government forces.
Some 550 guerrillas and 332 soldiers and police officers have been killed since then, officials said, and another 1,400 rebels have been arrested.
Last weekend, rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians in an attack on the Achham district headquarters and a nearby airport.
Nearly 2,500 people have been killed since the rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, began fighting six years ago for the abolition of constitutional monarchy. They are led by the elusive Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
Analysts say the Maoist campaign has grown on fertile ground. This tiny, Himalayan kingdom has been beset by crushing poverty and a succession of weak elected governments after King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah gave up absolute monarchy in 1990.
The adored monarch was killed last year by his son, then-Crown Prince Dipendra.

The torrent flooded villages in Gopalganj district, 95 miles north of Patna, the Bihar state capital, the Central Water Commission's daily flood bulletin said.
Traffic on the highway linking Gopalganj to other areas was snarled after water from the Gandhak River submerged a large stretch.

Some 5,000 soldiers and civilians are watching the Jiujiang dikes for leaks, said an official of the city's Antiflood Command Center. He would give only his surname, Peng.
Nearly 1,000 people have been reported killed in flooding or landslides since China's rainy season began in June. But most were in mountain or desert regions far from areas such as the Yangtze basin that have built up dikes and other preparations because of chronic annual flooding.

The death toll from floods and water borne diseases in Bihar has risen to 352, said Alok Ranjan, a senior relief official.
Hundreds of thousands of acres of crops have been washed away in the floods which have hit 24 of Bihar's 38 districts, Ranjan said.
Relief authorities were distributing wheat, rice and food packets to people stranded on rooftops and in 723 relief centers that have been set up in the flood-hit districts. Medical teams had set up nearly 550 health centers where people were being given medication to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea.
In neighboring Bangladesh, waters of the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers were receding and were flowing at normal levels.
Hundreds of thousands of flood-hit villagers, who had been evacuated to temporary shelters on higher ground, were returning home.
They were busy rebuilding their homes, rigging up plastic sheets and tarpaulins on bamboo sticks, as the seasonal monsoon rains receded.
In all, monsoon floods have killed at least 416 people in India; another 158 people have died in neighboring Bangladesh.

""At least 18 rebels were killed in Rolpa (west of here), six in Dadeldhura, (far west), and one each in Parbat (northwest) and Kailali (far southwest) on Thursday,"" a statement from the ministry said.
The security forces also recovered arms and ammunition from the rebels, it said.
Rolpa is a key Maoist stronghold and the origin of their armed ""people's war"" to topple the monarchy, launched in 1996.
More than 4,000 people have since died, about one-quarter of them in the past week alone in a massive government offensive on Rolpa.

The Gandhak and Ganges rivers were gushing after water was released from the Balmikinagar Dam, which had been threatened because of dangerously high water levels behind it.
The torrent flooded villages in Gopalganj district, 95 miles north of Patna, the Bihar state capital, the Central Water Commission's daily flood bulletin said.
Traffic on the highway linking Gopalganj to other areas was snarled after water from the Gandhak River submerged a large stretch.
Across South Asia, some 25 million people have been forced from their homes in an enlarged version of what is an annual exodus to escape monsoon flooding. Since June, more than 1,000 people have been killed by rains in Nepal, neighboring areas of India and low-lying Bangladesh.
In China, the city of Jiujiang braced for high water racing toward it down the Yangtze River. Sections of Jiujiang were flooded when a dike failed during torrential rains in 1998. But officials say preparations this year are more thorough and they don't expect major flooding. Weather was forecast to be clear on Wednesday.
Some 5,000 soldiers and civilians are watching the Jiujiang dikes for leaks, said an official of the city's Antiflood Command Center. He would give only his surname, Peng.
Nearly 1,000 people have been reported killed in flooding or landslides since China's rainy season began in June. But most were in mountain or desert regions far from areas such as the Yangtze basin that have built up dikes and other preparations because of chronic annual flooding.
At least nine people were killed and 26 were missing after heavy rains in southeastern Afghanistan triggered a mudslide in this drought-affected nation, an official said Tuesday. All the missing and dead had gone to collect firewood Monday in a mountain range just south of Khost.
Two boys ages 3 and 5 drowned in swollen rivers in the Dong Thap province in Vietnam last week, as water levels in the Mekong River rose and some areas were submerged. Three people also drowned in the Mekong in Cambodia two days ago, officials said Tuesday.

"124",2002139,"Title: Pakistani admits sending e-mails of captive Pearl, sent to jail.rtf; Date: March 1, 2002 Friday; Text: A Pakistani man admitted to a court Friday that he helped send e-mails showing slain US reporter Daniel Pearl in captivity, his lawyer said.
The court appearance came as Pakistan said it reserved the right to try the confessed mastermind of Pearl's kidnapping, British Islamic militant Sheikh Omar, whom the United States wants extradited.
In a tightly guarded Karachi courtroom, Salman Saquib confessed to allegations he helped send the e-mails of the captive Wall Street Journal correspondent, one of which showed Pearl with a gun to his head.
The e-mails threatened to kill Pearl unless a series of demands were met, such as the release of Pakistanis detained by the United States in military operations in Afghanistan.
A grisly videotape showing Pearl's slaying surfaced last week.
The magistrate ordered Saquib into judicial custody pending charges, defense lawyer Khawaja Naveed said. The suspect was taken from the court to jail with his face covered by a cloth.
The lawyer said the judge barred him from seeing Saquib's confessional statement for fear it would be leaked to the press.
Naveed said he did not consider his client's confession valid because Saquib had been in police custody since February 11, beyond the regular two-week period allowed for interrogation.
But under a new anti-terrorism law, Saquib's police detention had been extended Monday.
""This statement has been recorded after he was in police custody for 20 days. The later it is recorded means it is not voluntary,"" Naveed told AFP.
He also said the judge authorized Saquib to receive medical care for lingering health problems.
According to police, Saquib suffers from a bullet wound he received while fighting either on behalf of the Taliban in Afghanistan or against Indian troops in Kashmir.
Police have accused two other men of joining Saquib in sending the e-mails of Pearl. Fahad Naseem is also in jail pending charges, while former police intelligence officer Sheikh Adil remains in police custody.
The United States has put up a five-million-dollar reward for information leading to the capture or conviction of anyone involved in the kidnapping of Pearl, who disappeared January 23 as he sought to interview Islamic militants.
Washington has also asked for the extradition of Sheikh Omar, who admitted before a court February 14 that he masterminded Pearl's abduction.
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Inam ul Haque said Friday in Tokyo that his government was still examining the US requests, which were made personally to President Pervez Musharraf.
""I am not ruling out the possibilities of extradition,"" Haque told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. ""The government is examining the request.""
But he added Pakistan has ""the first right"" to try to punish Omar in a domestic court.
Pakistan has extradited to the United States suspects in the past, but only for crimes that occurred on US soil.
Musharraf has acknowledged that Pearl's kidnapping may have been part of the backlash against a crackdown on Islamic extremists he announced January 12.
The United States also wants Omar, whose full name is Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, over the 1994 kidnapping of an American in India.
The London-born militant spent five years in an Indian jail over that abduction, in which three Britons were also snatched.
He was released in exchange for the passengers of an Indian Airlines plane hijacked from Nepal to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
Britain indicated Thursday it would not object to an extradition of Omar, 29, who holds both British and Pakistani nationalities.

"125",20022569,"Title: Maldives seeks UN recognition for South Asian body.rtf; Date: January 5, 2002 Saturday; Text: The tiny Indian Ocean atoll nation of the Maldives Saturday called for United Nations recognition for the seven-member South Asian regional grouping to be heard collectively at the world body.
Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom told a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) that the regional organisation did not have a voice of its own.
""Even though our region accounts for one-fifth of the humanity the world body represents, SAARC does not have a status or standing within the UN system,"" Gayoom said. ""This is an issue that deserves our attention.""
Gayoom, 64, who is the only leader of SAARC to have attended all 11 summits since the first one in December 1985, said he believed progress in the organisation was slow.
""I believe that we are going through a traumatic phase in regional cooperation. It will take a great amount of energy, persistence and commitment, indeed a Himalayan effort, to restart what has unfortunately become a stalled process,"" Gayoom said. ""But do it we must.""
The summits have been held up due to bilateral bickering between India and Pakistan. The summit that opened here Saturday should have been held here in November 1999 but was put off after squabbling between the two countries.
Gayoom called for informal political consultations among member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- to ease the bilateral tensions affecting the SAARC.
""We must open all doors for fostering a culture of peace and tolerance in South Asia,"" Gayoom said. ""We must leave Kathmandu with a clear vision of what SAARC should and could achieve in the immediate future.""
Gayoom, a founding member of SAARC, said he was making self-criticism in a bid to revive the regional body and realise its objectives of improving the living standards of the 1.3 billion population of South Asia.
He also called for greater efforts to protect the environment.
""The progress achieved by SAARC in the area of environmental conservation has been too slow,"" said Gayoom, who is leading a crusade against global warming which is threatening to wipe his tiny atoll nation off the face of the earth.
Gayoom used the summit here to focus attention on environmental issues that affect the 1,192 coral islands of the Maldives scattered some 850 kilometres (525 miles) across the equator.
It is the first time that Gayoom has raised the issue at Kathmandu, at an elevation of 4,340 feet (1,324 metres) above sea level.
A rise of a few feet in the sea level could submerge most of the islands in the Maldives and the country, which has a population of 250,000 Sunni Muslims, could potentially produce the world's first environmental refugees.
Although the South Asian grouping, which comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, may have done little to collectively address the issue, the Maldives has been battling the issue single-handedly.
After Gayoom's repeated appeals from virtually every world forum he addressed, the United Nations organised the Earth Summit in Rio. Gayoom also hosted the first ""small states conference on sea level rise"" in 1989.

The rebels were shot dead in seven districts around the kingdom, the defense ministry said in a statement.
The highest toll was in the western Saylan district, where seven rebels were killed, it said.
The heavy death toll came as the Maoists launched a general strike to press the government to agree to talks, which the rebels hope would lead to the abolition of the monarchy.
The shutdown brought the capital Kathmandu and other cities to a virtual standstill, with most businesses closing down fearing attack.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has refused to resume talks with the rebels until they lay down their arms.
More than 3,100 people have died in Nepal since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996.

Another six policemen were seriously injured in the accident, he said.
The dead were identified as Police Inspector Govinda Paudel and Sub Inspector Dil Bahadur Gharti.
The names of the six injured officers were not revealed.
The incident took place on the busy Pokhara-Kathmandu highway, to the west, some 120 kilometre (70 miles) west of Kathmandu, he said.
The policemen were escorting two senior deputy inspector generals, Kumar Koirala and Basu Wali of the Armed Police Force, back from an inspection tour of Baglung, 260 kilometres (162 miles) west of Kathmandu.
""The Maoists were believed to have set the booby trap to assassin the two senior police officials but they miraculously escaped death when the vehicle in front of them passed over it first,"" the official said.
Meanwhile, a Maoist rebel was killed Thursday in an encounter with the army in the far western district of Rolpa, a defence ministry press release said.
It said the Maoist was identified as Shankher Darlami alias Pradeep, a member of the Maoist' Peoples District Committee.
Eighteen other suspected Maoists have been arrested across the country as the government steps up its crackdown on the rebels.
Maoists have been fighting for a communist republic in the kingdom and the insurgency has so far claimed the lives of over 2,300 people.
The government and the rebels agreed a ceasefire in July, but three rounds of peace talks yielded little progress and the Maoists broke the truce in late November prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in Nepal.

But after much debate and some security changes, the U.S. military's 6th Area Support Group, based in Germany, decided to go ahead with an annual rodeo and festival that surrounds July 4.
With warnings at home and abroad that terrorists could target Americans celebrating their independence, U.S. citizens living in foreign countries have had to decide how to honor the holiday far away.
""Trying to decide what was correct for the American residents was the hardest,"" said Jennifer Sanders, spokeswoman for the 6th area group. ""We didn't want to stop tradition, it's a big event even for the German communities.""
On Monday, the State Department warned Americans traveling abroad to avoid clubs, restaurants, schools or outdoor events where fellow Americans gather because terrorists could choose them as a target.
The bulletin said the government has credible evidence that terrorist violence is imminent and could include suicide attacks. No specific target, timing or method is known to U.S. officials but Americans were urged to be more aware of their security while in crowds, avoid them or find other places that don't attract many Americans.
But crowds of Americans living all over Asia, Europe and the Middle East were still planning to gather for fireworks and barbecues.
""Every time Americans come together nowadays, people feel patriotic,"" said Joanne Blakemore, president of the American Association in Singapore. ""Maybe that's one of the good things that came out of Sept. 11.""
Guests joining celebrations at an American military installation in Singapore were asked to leave backpacks and coolers at home when they get together on July 6th. The event is expected to draw U.S. sailors and many of the 18,000 Americans living in the city state where authorities last year uncovered a plot to attack American naval ships.
U.S. facilities overseas have been on a continual state of alert since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on American. Embassies are heavily guarded and in some cases, even barricaded. American schools, clubs and places of worship have increased security too, especially after recent attacks in Pakistan on the U.S. consulate and a church.
With so few Americans left in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, the U.S. Embassy is not planning any public affair. Embassy dependents and nonessential staff were evacuated due to terror threats and the India-Pakistan crisis. Many private groups, including missionary organizations and businesses, pulled people out between Sept. 11 and the start of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
Elsewhere in the region, vigilance mixed with resilience as American prepared for July 4th.
""We are going to celebrate our Independence Day come hell or high water but we will be on high alert,"" said Sheila Hoban, spokeswoman for the embassy in Katmandu, Nepal.
The Bush administration said Sunday that Americans should take extra care on the Fourth of July because the national holiday is an attractive symbol to potential terrorists. The FBI plans to monitor and protect major Independence Day parades and festivities at home.
""There have been a variety of … intelligence reports that suggest we ought to be especially vigilant as we go into the Fourth of July season,"" Secretary of State Colin Powell said.
Andrew Somers, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, said his group will double the number of security guards for its an annual bash, which attracted 11,000 people last year.
""We're not going to be naive about (a threat). I think it's remote, but who knows.""
Both the U.S. Embassy and the Russian government are advising the group on security needs for the celebration, which will be held on July 6 on the lawns of a former noble estate.
Privately hired guards and Moscow police will be outfitted with hand-held metal detectors. ""If somebody looks funny, they'll give them a frisk,"" Somers said.
In the Philippines, U.S. troops will spend the day actively engaged in the war on terrorism.
""It'll be a work day, I'll celebrate in my heart,"" said Air Force Maj. Richard Slater.
In Paris, where authorities say they uncovered a plot shortly after Sept. 11 to bomb the U.S. Embassy, celebrations will be more low key.

Deuba, accompanied by senior government officials, will on Thursday hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on ways to tackle the insurgency.
India has already promised Nepal help in fighting the rebels, some of whom have slipped across the porous border with India to be trained by Indian Maoist groups.
New Delhi has already donated two helicopters to the Royal Nepal Army as part of its assistance since Kathmandu imposed a state of emergency and ordered the army to crack down on the rebels.
The rebels, drawing their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and end multiparty rule.
New Delhi has in return been asking Kathmandu to curb the activities of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), the country's spy agency, on Nepalese soil. However, Nepal denies the existence of an ISI network.
During his visit, Deuba will also meet Indian Home Minister L.K. Advani, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, Commerce Minister Murasoli Maran besides calling on Indian President K.R. Narayanan and Vice President Krishna Kant.
It is the first visit to India by a Nepalese prime minister since former Prime Minister Gitrija Prasad Koirala paid an official visit in August 2000.
Vajpayee visited Kathmandu in January this year to attend the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit.

Once the bodies have been identified, authorities were expected to invite relatives of the victims to Nepal, said a doctor at Katmandu's Teaching Hospital on condition of anonymity.
Fifteen foreigners - 13 Germans, one American and one Briton - and three Nepalese crew members were killed when a Canadian-built Twin Otter, owned by private domestic carrier Shangri-La Air, crashed Thursday near Pokhara, a resort town 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu.
The plane was flying from Jomson, a popular trekking route and a Hindu religious site, to Pokhara, when it slammed into a hillside and disintegrated on impact. The army has cordoned off the area where the bodies and pieces of the fuselage were recovered.
Doctors have already returned the bodies of the three crew members to their relatives.
Meanwhile, rescuers have recovered four bodies from the Trishuli River where a bus with 45 people on board sank three days ago, police said Sunday.
There was no trace of the other 41 missing passengers, said police officer Shyam Gharti.
Four bodies were recovered on Saturday night 25 kilometers (15 miles) downstream from the accident site, said Gharti by telephone.
On Friday, rescuers found the body of the driver who appeared to have been thrown out of the bus as it plunged into the river.
The bus veered off the highway at Nagali Khola, nearly 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
The tragedies came during monsoon rains, which have killed more than 500 people in Nepal in the past month, most of them in landslides.

International human rights groups have charged that Nepal's army has used force as a first resort against the Maoists since a state of emergency was imposed by King Gyanendra on November 26.
The emergency broadens security forces' power to interrogate or detain anyone with suspected links to the Maoists, whose armed campaign to topple the monarchy has cost an estimated 4,300-plus lives since 1996.
The king decreed the special measures at Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's recommendation two days after the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire and launched a string of bloody attacks.

One of the petitions was filed by 56 members of the ruling Nepali Congress party, including its general secretary Shushil Koirala and three former cabinet ministers under Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who argued that the premier should have consulted his colleagues before parliament was dissolved.
""Deuba dissolved the elected parliament two years in advance and called for the mid-term polls on November 13 without the approval of the council of ministers headed by him,"" said Shankher Prasad Pandey, one of the main petititoners.
""It is only the council of ministers which has the sovereign rights to disband the parliament while fresh polls cannot be fixed when the country is under the state of emergency rule,"" Pandey said.
Similar petitions were filed to the supreme court by lawmakers from two opposition parties and by a senior lawyer, Dhruva Koirala.
The court is expected to examine the cases Thursday. Deuba has been asked to justify his actions by June 11 under an earlier petition.
King Gyanendra last month on Deuba's advice dissolved parliament and called new elections as the assembly looked set to defeat a proposed extension of emergency rule, imposed in November to counter Maoist rebels.

Sources told AFP as many as 4,000 rebels were involved in the raids overnight at Sandhikharka in the Arghakanchi district, 215 kilometres (134 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
State-run radio said the two sides clashed for more than four hours and that the casualty figures were ""big"".
The chief of the armed police force said two policemen had been killed and 30 injured.
Up to 250 security personnel were stationed at the posts, officials said.
Just 24 hours earlier, 49 policemen were lined up and shot in the head when 1,000 Maoist rebels attacked a police post at Bhimad in the eastern Sindhuli district, 85 kilometres east of Kathmandu, officials said. Ten more were injured.
Minister of State for Home Devendra Raj Kandel said as many as 70 rebels could have been killed in those clashes.
Sunday's assaults were the first major rebel offensives since a 10-month state of emergency -- imposed to combat the rebels -- lapsed on August 28.
Emergency rule was first introduced in November last year after the guerrillas broke a four-month ceasefire with the government and pulled out of peace talks.
At the same time the Royal Nepal Army was ordered into action against the rebels for the first time.
The emergency gave local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected rebels and impose curfews.
But opposition and rights groups said it curtailed human rights and had not been effective in the fight against the guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1996 for a communist republic. The insurgency has so far claimed more than 4,400 lives.
It was renewed twice but expired late last month and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba decided not to extend it again because he has called elections for November 13.
But since it expired there have been blasts almost daily in the Nepalese capital, which have injured several people. A soldier was killed trying to defuse one of the bombs.
The rebels have not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police suspect they are involved.
Deuba last week said the government was considering reimposing the emergency.

The announcement came days before the kingdom's prime minister is due in Washington to appeal for military support to quash the uprising, which has intensified sharply in recent months.

Security forces have reported a heavy toll on the Maoists in recent days. The defense ministry said that on Wednesday some 22 rebels were killed in clashes around the kingdom.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is due Tuesday to make the first visit by a Nepalese premier to the White House, where he will discuss with President George W. Bush ways to quell the Maoist insurgency, which has left more than 3,200 people dead.
The Bush administration has already asked Congress to approve 20 million dollars in military aid to Nepal.
The Maoists, who are staunchly anti-American, exert de facto control in parts of Nepal's impoverished countryside, where they have promised radical redistribution of wealth.
The Maoist leadership Thursday appealed for unconditional talks to end the rebellion, saying dialogue was needed ""to avoid foreign army intervention"" in the Himalayan state.
Deuba has also been under pressure from within his Nepali Congress party and the parliamentary opposition to resume talks with the Maoists, but he has refused any negotiations until the rebels lay down their arms.
Three rounds of talks initiated last year by Deuba ended in stalemate, with the government refusing Maoist demands that the monarchy be scrapped. The rebels broke the four-month ceasefire in November with a string of bloody attacks on the police and army.
The Maoists called a general strike last month to press their demands for talks and in early April launched their most lethal assault yet, leaving at least 164 people dead in raids on police posts in southwestern Nepal.
But internal differences have also emerged between Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachand, who favors dialogue with the government, and a faction led by Ram Bahadura Thapa, alias Badal, who believes the monarchy must be defeated by force.
Government officials said a bag was found Wednesday in the northwestern Seti river with the heads of 40 rebels apparently killed in a clash between Maoist factions.

The meeting comes amid high tension between Pakistan and India after suspected Muslim rebels killed 34 people Tuesday in an assault on a civilian bus and the residential quarters of an Indian army camp in disputed Kashmir.
India and Pakistan were represented in Kathmandu respectively by their agriculture minister and secretary, officials said.
The officials of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) directed the regional body's secretary general, Q.A.M.A. Rahim of Bangladesh, to present the common policy at a UN Food and Agriculture Organization summit next month in Rome.
The ministers and secretaries adopted a resolution ""emphasizing that hunger cannot be eliminated unless poverty is addressed in a comprehensive manner.""
They also called for increased regional and international cooperation to meet targets set by the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996, which aimed to halve the number of hungry people by 2015.
SAARC represents more than one-sixth of the world's population and one of its poorest regions.
Meetings of the regional body have often been scuttled by rivalries between India and Pakistan.

The proposal for SAARCPOL, like the INTERPOL and ASIANPOL, was put forward by Nepal to combat growing criminal activities in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations.
The SAARC, formed in 1985, groups India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan.
""During the two day meeting, we (Nepal) put forward the proposal for SAARCPOL and it was agreed to be formed in principle by all the members,"" Inspector General of Police Pradeep Shumshere Rana told reporters at a press conference Thursday evening.
""The proposal will now be taken up during the meetings of SAARC foreign secretary and Council of Ministers before being put forward at the summit itself,"" he said.
Asked if bilateral issues were discussed at the two-day meeting, Rana said:""No bilateral issues were taken up during the conference.""
He was replying to questions whether Nepal had raised the Maoist problem with Indian police officials.
""However the Indian police officials have pledged their support to control the Maoist problem during informal sideline talks,"" he said.
Rana said the Indian side comprised of police officers from Bengal and Bihar - two of the Indian states believed to have significant Maoist sympathizers.
While the spokesman for the conference, Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Govinda Thapa said the meeting agreed that the chief of police from each of the seven member nations should meet once every year.
""The criminal activities and problem faced by police in the region are similar so Nepal has put forward the concept of regional umbrella body for police,"" he said.
He said the conference had agreed to form a monitoring desk for organizational crimes as well as exchange information and experiences and organize joint training for police in the region.
The next SAARC police conference will be held in Pakistan.

The police in the Siraha district, 180 kilometers (110 miles) south of the capital Kathmandu, were returning from the scene of a reported Maoist attack.
""They went to help but the Maoists had absconded. When the police were returning, their vehicle went over a booby trap, killing nine of them,"" Nepal's state minister for home affairs, Devendra Raj Kandel, told AFP.
Violence linked to the Maoists, who are fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy, has surged since August 28, when a state of emergency was lifted after nine months.
Massive guerrilla attacks on police posts September 6 and 7 left dead some 115 policemen and soldiers as well as more than 250 rebels, according to figures from defense ministry officials.
In one of the attacks, the Maoists lined up 49 troops and shot them dead, the officials said.
On Thursday, 15 rebels were killed by security forces in clashes across the kingdom, the defense ministry said in a statement Friday.
More than 4,700 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in February 1996.
Two-thirds of the deaths have come since the rebels broke a ceasefire in November 2001, prompting the government to impose the emergency and deploy the army against the rebels for the first time.
The Maoists have called for a nationwide strike Monday, a frequent rebel tactic to try to demonstrate support for the insurgency. Residents say the Maoists often attack anyone who opens a shop or ventures outside during the shutdowns.
Security forces appealed to transport operators to keep running Monday.
Separately, the country's top mainstream communist party said it favored eventual peace talks with the Maoists but called on the rebels to declare a unilateral ceasefire to end the impasse.
The statement by the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist came after the Maoists Thursday proposed dialogue with the government.
The offer has been rejected by the government, which says the Maoists must first give up their demands for an assembly to redraft the constitution.

Heads of state or government from the grouping's seven members -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- are scheduled to attend the summit.
Nepalese Finance Minister Ramsharan Mahat said the foreign ministers will deliberate on issues of economic cooperation, including a free-trade arrangement for South Asia and the goal of a regional economic union.
Mahat is taking part as foreign minister because Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba concurrently serves as foreign minister.
A treaty framework for a South Asian free-trade zone is proposed to be ready by the end of the year.
The foreign ministers will also discuss antiterrorism measures with reference to the position of South Asia, Mahat said.
The meeting of the SAARC Standing Committee, which met earlier this week, recommended implementation in the region of a U.N. antiterrorism resolution.
The resolution, passed after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, calls for cutting funding for terrorists, among other measures.
The ministers are also expected to renew their call on SAARC countries to expedite enactment of national laws to implement an antiterrorism convention signed by them in 1987.
Lack of such laws has hindered implementation of the convention.
The foreign ministers will also consider the broad vision presented by a group of eminent persons about the desirability of a South Asian economic union, Mahat said.
Meanwhile, Bangladeshi diplomat Q.A.M.A. Rahim was appointed SAARC secretary general, taking over the job from Nihal Rodrigo of Sri Lanka, who completes his term on Jan. 10.
Rahim's appointment was confirmed at a meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers, a Nepalese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

As the United States sought to defuse tensions between the nuclear-armed South Asian nations, Pakistan detained the founder of the outlawed Islamic militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which Indian officials linked to the attack that killed 35 people.
Hafiz Mohamad Saeed, the former leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba, or the Army of the Pure, was taken into custody Wednesday on suspicion he was planning to create unrest, officials in Pakistan said.
Lashkar-e-Taiba is accused of suicide bombings and is also blamed by India for a December attack on its parliament that sent tensions on the subcontinent spiralling.
But Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani said Pakistan had not done enough and lashed out at Washington for its support of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in its ""war on terrorism"".
""It is unfortunate that when Pakistan has not renounced terrorism there are still some Western countries aiding Pakistan economically and in other ways,"" he told reporters.
""Whichever country uses terrorism as an instrument of national policy should not be helped by any country in the world,"" said Advani, who met later with US Ambassador Robert Blackwill.
The hawkish home minister also met later with Defense Minister George Fernandes and Indian Kashmir's chief minister Farooq Abdullah. They were briefed by senior army commanders on their options.
""Pakistan is not going to stop this war that it has unleashed in India,"" said Abdullah, who has long called for strikes on militant camps across the disputed Kashmir border.
The home ministry said in a statement a number of possible actions had been discussed at the security meeting, including ""continued operations against the terrorists and action against the overground support base of the terrorists"".
The chief of the Indian army, General S. Padmanabhan, hinted he favored military action.
""I don't want to go into the specifics but time for action has come,"" Padmanabhan told Indian television network Star News during a visit to Nepal.
Parliament was due to discuss the attack Friday. The main opposition Congress party, harshly critical of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee over his handling of anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, has pledged to support the government in curbing terrorism.
Vajpayee held a separate half-hour meeting Thursday with Fernandes, Advani and Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, officials said.
On Tuesday, militants disguised as soldiers opened fire on a civilian bus near Jammu, Kashmir's Hindu-majority winter capital, and killed seven passengers before storming the residential quarters of a nearby Indian army camp. Most of the 28 camp victims were women and children.
India's defense ministry identified the three attackers as Pakistanis from the central province of Punjab.
The names given by the ministry were similar to those given by a previously unknown rebel group called al-Mansoorain, which told Kashmir media it was responsibile for the attacks.
Indian newspapers speculated al-Mansoorain could be a pseudonym for Lashkar-e-Taiba.
US President George W. Bush condemned what he also termed a ""terrorist attack"", saying it was ""also aimed at destroying opportunities for South Asia to build a future that is more stable, more peaceful, and more prosperous"".
India and Pakistan have massed about one million troops on their common borders since the parliament attack in December. New Delhi has ruled out any pullback.
Police in Pakistani-administered Kashmir said Indian troops had shelled border villages for three straight days, killing two teenagers on Wednesday.
Skirmishes over the disputed border are common in Kashmir, the focal point of two of the three full-scale wars between India and Pakistan since independence from Britain in 1947.
The Muslim-majority territory in the Himalayan mountains is divided between the rival neighbours and claimed by both.

The two-day meeting in London, starting Wednesday, will include representatives of donor and lending agencies and envoys from China, Scandinavian countries and the Himalayan kingdom's largest donor, Japan.
Besides development assistance, the meeting will discuss ""issues of social and economic reforms as well as development of sustainable peace and progress in the country,"" Andrew Mitchell, charge d'affaires at the British embassy in Kathmandu, said in a statement.
The forum comes after a trip by Nepal's caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba last month to London and Washington, where he sought military assistance for the crackdown on the Maoist rebels.
The Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire in November and launched an intense wave of attacks, devastating the tourism industry, which employs some 250,000 people and is the impoverished country's chief source of foreign currency.
Arrival of foreign tourists plunged some 46 percent in the first quarter of 2002 compared with the same period last year, according to hotel and tour operators' figures.
The government says it has also incurred 250 million dollars in damages and revenue loss from attacks to civilian infrastructure, a frequent Maoist tactic.
Officials from the country's foreign and finance ministries, the army and the national planning commission will attend the London meeting, as will the premier's wife Arjoo Deuba, representing a non-governmental organisation.

"150",2002734,"Title: Blair moves to Pakistan , seeking explicit condemnation of terrorism.rtf; Date: January 6, 2002 Sunday; Text: British Prime Minister Tony Blair was flying Monday to Islamabad to press Pakistan's government to make an unequivocal condemnation of terrorism as a step toward defusing a dangerous showdown with India.
Blair joined India on Sunday in pressing for such a Pakistani statement, implicitly rejecting Pakistan's recent crackdown on Islamic militants as insufficient.
In a graphic demonstration of the continuing tension along the India-Pakistan border, Indian soldiers shot down a Pakistani drone aircraft that intruded into Indian air space Sunday in the disputed region of Kashmir, an Indian army spokesman said.
Pakistani authorities have announced mass arrests of militants for the past two weeks, including the leaders and other members of two groups - Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed - which India accuses of the December 13 assault on India's Parliament. Fourteen people were killed in attack, including the five assailants.
Pakistani police said Sunday that security forces arrested 42 Muslim militants in eastern Punjab province, raising to 300 the number of detainees held in the crackdown against groups opposed to Indian rule over two-thirds of the disputed Kashmir.
""We've welcomed some of the actions that have been taken by Pakistan over the past few days, but there's no doubt what needs to happen,"" Blair said at a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee following an hour of talks Sunday night.
""There must be a complete rejection of the types of terrorist actions carried out on the 1st of October and the 13th of December,"" Blair said, referring to attacks on the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir and the Indian Parliament, both blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
""There is no halfway house for that,"" said Blair.
During his three-day visit to India, planned long before the Dec. 13 attack, Blair has strongly sided with Indian demands that Musharraf crack down hard on Islamic militants and disavow any support of violence in regard to Kashmir.
In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, Blair had joined the United States in wooing Musharraf to support the military campaign in Afghanistan.
Vajpayee and Musharraf twice shook hands during last week's South Asian summit in Katmandu, Nepal, raising hopes that they might prepared to negotiate a solution to their differences.
India, however, has said Pakistan needs to do more, and Vajpayee said in a speech to a banquet attended by Blair that India was prepared to take military action.
The attack on India's Parliament ""conveyed to us the stark message that we have to crush this terrorism from its source, even if we have to do it without outside help,"" Vajpayee said.
At his news conference with Blair, Vajpayee said he had met Musharraf briefly at the end of the South Asian summit, in the same room with the other five leaders, and he said there was no discussion about opening negotiations.
""While we were waiting there, I did refer to the speech made by Gen. Musharraf … and I pointed out that in the entire speech the word 'terrorism' had been avoided. He did not reply,"" Vajpayee said.
""It was a very big omission.""
Blair and Vajpayee signed a joint declaration which equated the two attacks in India with the Sept. 13 terrorist strikes in New York and Washington, calling them ""deliberate attempts to shatter the peace of our peoples and to undermine democratic values.""
""We reject the arguments of those who attempt to justify terrorism, which in all its forms must be condemned unambiguously and eradicated wherever it exists,"" said the so-called New Delhi Declaration.
Pakistan and India have twice gone to war over their bitter differences on Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between them.
India says Pakistan is waging a ""proxy war"" in Kashmir. Musharraf has called them ""freedom fighters"" and said his government supports them morally and diplomatically.
Blair again stressed that Britain was calling for dialogue between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute, but first, he said, Pakistan needed to unequivocally denounce terrorism.

"151",20021498,"Title: NATO Opens Moscow Military Mission.rtf; Date: May 27, 2002 Monday; Text: NATO opened its long-delayed military mission in Moscow on Monday, on the eve of a summit meeting in Rome intended to give Russia an equal say in formulating policy on some European security issues.
""This is a big change, because it will allow NATO countries, NATO and Russia, to discuss … and take decisions on things to be done in collaboration in fields of security and military interests,"" said Italian Admiral Guido Venturioni, head of NATO's military committee.
He and Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, then cut a blue ribbon stretched across the entrance to the new office.
Some NATO officials see the new relationship to be inaugurated outside Rome on Tuesday as a painless gesture of support for Russia, which has been an enthusiastic member of the U.S.-led anti-terrorist coalition and has been pushing for more recognition as a top international player.
The new council is to replace a consultative body set up in May 1997 to ease Moscow's alarm over NATO's plans to include some of Russia's Soviet-era allies and neighbors. NATO officials optimistically described the arrangement as ""19 plus one,"" while the Russians regarded it as ""19 against one"" - a useless talk shop where their opinion made no difference.
The rupture over the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia underlined the fragility of the council. Moscow abruptly terminated almost all cooperation with NATO, and plans to open a military mission in Moscow were frozen.
Under the 1997 agreement, NATO and Russia consulted only after the NATO allies had negotiated their own consensus - and the NATO position was set. Some NATO members were loath to engage Russia and some Russian members of the joint council refused to take part in working groups, said a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
This time, Russian diplomats will be in on the negotiations from the beginning. No less important, they will have access to the informal discussions where many positions are initially hammered out.
Venturioni also met Monday with Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, who praised the agreement as promoting ""a new quality of relations between Russia and NATO,"" in a report by Interfax-Military News Agency.
But the range of issues to be considered in the new council is limited, initially including crisis management, peacekeeping and such military areas as air defense, search-and-rescue operations and joint exercises. Under the new arrangement, NATO and Russia will decide only on those issues on which they can find consensus; more contentious issues will be left off their agenda, and NATO will keep a free hand in setting and implementing policy.
That annoys some Russian hard-liners.
""The relationship will be useless in helping European stability, and dangerous, too, because it creates the illusion of cooperation - cooperation in which Russia will be listened to, but not heard,"" said Leonid Ivashov, a former general in the Russian armed forces who is now vice president of the Institute of Geopolitical Problems in Moscow.
Russian analysts say the new relationship could founder if NATO should decide to take action against Russian partner Belarus' authoritarian leader or if the United States increases its military presence in formerly Soviet Central Asia and the Caucasus in its anti-terrorism campaign.
Even proponents of the new relationship say its success is hardly guaranteed.
""I'm convinced that if we only talk instead of taking concrete decisions, carrying them out and taking responsibility for them, the fate could be the same as before,"" Baluyevsky told reporters at the NATO office opening. ""But I think we are starting out on a more pragmatic, realistic and concrete path.""
He stressed that the new relationship did not ease Russia's opposition to NATO expansion.
""There are problems, there have been and will be problems"" between Russia and NATO, Baluyevsky said. ""But these are not problems that require us to look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sights look at one another through the sightsormandy

Lawmakers from the remote Achham district in northwestern Nepal where Sunday's attacks took place said the government had received warnings of the pending assault and did not act.
The guerrillas, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, attacked government offices and a small airport in Achham, killing 77 policemen, 55 soldiers, an intelligence officer and four civilians.
Deuba on Monday raised the death toll to 137 from 129, adding a policeman and seven soldiers to the casualty list.
The government imposed the state of emergency Nov. 26 after the rebels ended peace talks and renewed attacks on government targets. Also, King Gyanendra ordered the army to fight the rebels, a task left previously to the overmatched police force.
The emergency measures restrict freedom of the press, assembly, expression and movement and allow suspects to be detained for three weeks without charge.
Deuba on Monday urged lawmakers to extend the emergency, saying it had shown results.
""The situation in country has gotten better since the emergency was imposed and such a task takes time. So it is our compulsion to continue mobilization of the security forces,"" Deuba told Parliament.
The attacks came as the impoverished Himalayan nation was still coming to terms with the June palace massacre of King Birendra and eight other royals by Crown Prince Dipendra, who then shot himself. Nepal is a constitutional monarchy.
Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory to warn Americans about travel in Nepal after the guerrillas staged attacks near popular tourist destinations, including the main entry point for the Mount Everest trek. The latest attacks were not near tourist sites.
Deuba said the army has sent reinforcements by helicopter to the Achham district, 375 miles northwest of the capital Katmandu. He said the military had taken control of the area and people were beginning to come out of their homes.
The melee in Parliament broke out after a member of the governing Nepali Congress party, representing the town of Mangalsen where the main attack took place, said the government ignored warnings that violence was coming. Another attack took place at the airport in the nearby town of Sanphebaga.
""Representatives and government officials from the area had warned the government about the possible attack. But it was ignored,"" Ram Bahadur Bista said.
Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khadka, the area's administrative chief, wrote several letters to the government seeking additional security forces, Bista said. Khadka died in the attack.
""The government has failed to provide security and prevent the attack, despite having information about the possible assault. It has now lost all moral ground to continue in power,"" said Pradeep Nepal of the main opposition United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.
More than 2,400 people have died in fighting since 1996.
The rebels have called a general strike Friday and Saturday to commemorate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency.

"154",20021876,"Title: Army attacks kill 550 Maoists in Nepal.rtf; Date: May 5, 2002 Sunday; Text: Nepalese officials said Sunday that more than 550 Maoist guerrillas had been killed in the most successful offensive carried out by security forces in their long struggle to quell the rebellion.
Most of the deaths came on Friday and Saturday when security forces attacked a camp in Lisne in the western district of Rolpa where around 800 guerrillas had gathered for training.
The official said the total minimum death toll of about 550 Maoist rebels included 50 guerrillas killed in another attack on a rebel base at Boktang in Doti district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of the capital on Thursday.
The official described the attack in Lisne, in which a mimimum of 500 rebels may have been killed, as the most successful by security forces against the Maoists' six-year insurgency to topple the constitutional monarchy.
""Never before have the security and police forces have achieved such a great success as they did this time,"" the official said.
""Before attacking, the soldiers blocked the outlets of the area which trapped most of the Maoists in the training camp surrounded by difficult terrains and jungle.""
""The successful operation to smash the Maoists in one of their major training camps at Lisne area of Rolpa and about 50 rebels in Boktang in Doti both to the far west, has boosted the morale of the security and armed police force,"" the official said.
Meanwhile Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba left Nepal Sunday for Washington where he will meet US President George Bush on Tuesday.
""I will seek US assistance to fight against Maoist terrorism in the country,"" Deuba told reporters before he left.
The Bush administration has asked Congress to authorize 20 million dollars in military aid to Nepal for its crackdown on the rebels, who have been fighting to overthrow the constitutional monarchy since 1996.
Deuba will travel on to London, where he will discuss the insurgency with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other senior government leaders, a foreign ministry official said.
When Deuba came to power last year he initiated three rounds of peace talks with the Maoists, but these floundered.
The rebels broke a ceasefire in November and shortly afterwards Deuba imposed a state of emergency and sent in the army to fight them.
""There is no question of holding dialogues with the Maoist rebels as long as they do not surrender arms to the Nepalese security,"" Deuba said.
State-run radio said the army had also asked the government not to hold talks with the rebels until they had been disarmed.
""The security forces are fully committed to the government's view that it is meaningless to hold talks with the Maoist terrorists until they surrender their weapons as they consider the talks as a part of their own plot,"" an army statement read on state-run radio said.
""It will be proper to hold talks on the issues as what kind of actions should be taken against the terrorists or to grant general amnesty only after the terrorists ask for forgiveness from the victimized nationalists and surrender themselves,"" it said.
On Thursday the Maoists said they were ready for unconditional talks with the government.

""The Maoists have never closed the door for peace talks with the government,"" Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachand, said in a statement marking the seventh anniversary of the start of the Maoist insurgency.
The statement, which was given to local newspapers, expressed a desire for dialogue if an ""appropriate situation"" was created, but did not spell out what conditions could lead to such a situation.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said last week that there was no possibility of any discussions until the rebels laid down their arms.
The Maoists launched their ""people's war"" on February 13, 1996 with an attack on a police post in the western district of Rolpa. Since then about 2,300 people have died in the insurgency.
Last July Deuba initiated a ceasefire with the rebels and three rounds of peace talks were held.
The rebels said then they would temporarily drop their demand for a republic so negotiations could make some headway, but the talks stalled over Maoist demands for the creation of a ""constituent assembly"" to rewrite the constitution.
In November the rebels broke the four-month truce with a series of bloody attacks on police and army posts.
A few days later the government declared emergency rule and deployed the army directly against the guerrillas for the first time.
Since then there have been regular clashes between security forces and the rebels, who the government has branded as terrorists.
The government now wants to extend the emergency for a further three months in order to fully crush the rebellion, but needs a two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament, which is due to vote on the issue this month.
Security measures around the country were stepped up on Wednesday as police feared attacks would be carried out to mark the anniversary.
Officials said three Maoist rebels were killed and three others seriously injured on Tuesday when a bomb they were making accidentally exploded at Bhirkat village in the Mugu district, 416 kilometres (260 miles) northwest of Kathmandu.
Another two rebels were killed after they clashed with security personnel in the western Lamjung district on Tuesday, a defence ministry source said.

The new figure -- up from at least 140 given on Friday -- makes the battle the deadliest in the Maoists' six-year insurgency to topple the constitutional monarchy.
More than 210 rebels were killed Thursday in the western district of Rolpa, some 298 kilometres (184 miles) west of Kathmandu, Kandel told AFP.
Another 40 were killed when security forces attacked a rebel base at Boktang in Doti district, 398 kilometres (246 miles) west of the capital.
Official sources said the heavy toll was inflicted in Rolpa when government forces spotted a high-level Maoist meeting at a training camp and pounded the base with attack helicopters.
The dead reportedly included local rebel commanders and instructors.
The defense ministry has confirmed the deaths of two soldiers in the operation.
""Now security forces are combing through the areas of the clashes to retrieve arms the Maoists had looted in previous attacks,"" Kandel said.
The assault comes about three weeks after Maoists raided three police posts in southwestern Nepal, leaving at least 164 people dead.
More than 3,300 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in Rolpa in 1996.

The measures were decreed on Nov. 26 after communist rebels withdrew from peace talks and launched a series of deadly attacks on police and the army.
The state of emergency had suspended all constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and the press, and the right to hold public meetings.
Thursday's announcement ends some, but not all, of the restrictions. Journalists will be allowed to publish or broadcast news on any subject except those that highlight acts of terror, the Royal Palace said.
Political parties will be able to hold public meetings and other functions, but must have the permission of local officials, officials said.
The rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, have been fighting to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy since 1996. More than 2,600 people have died in the fighting.

"160",20022011,"Title: Pakistan Explains Nuclear Policy.rtf; Date: June 4, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf said Tuesday that possessing nuclear weapons implies there are circumstances under which they will be used, but said it is irresponsible for a leader to discuss such things.
Asked at a news conference to state Pakistan's nuclear policy and explain why it will not renounce first use of nuclear weapons in case of war, as India has, Musharraf said, ""The possession of nuclear weapons by any state obviously implies they will be used under some circumstances.""
He said his country's deeper policy, however, is for de-nuclearization of South Asia.
""Never in the history of Pakistan has the nuclear arsenal ever been deployed, never have even the missiles been deployed,"" he said.
Musharraf spoke after a 16-nation Asian summit at which he and India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not speak to each other or interact.
The two nuclear-armed neighbors have 1 million troops deployed on their 1,800-mile border and the forces have been on war alert since December, raising international fears that they could be near their fourth war since independence from Britain in 1947.
""Pakistan will never initiate war,"" Musharraf said, ""… but will defend its honor and dignity with full resolve.""
He said, ""The reality of the tension between India and Pakistan is that India is continually threatening Pakistan for an attack and also refusing dialogue.""
He said there are almost daily reports of India's prime minister and defense minister threatening to ""teach Pakistan a lesson"" or discussing strikes into Pakistani territory.
During a bilateral meeting Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had offered to host talks between the two leaders on the sidelines of the Asian security summit in Almaty, Musharraf said he had been invited to Moscow for another attempt at a meeting with Vajpayee.
Musharraf said he did not know whether the Indian leader, who met with Putin shortly afterward, would go to Moscow.
During the summit, Vajpayee said he is willing to have a dialogue with Pakistan, but there must be a halt first to cross-border terrorism, which India says is carried out in its portion of Kashmir by Pakistan-based Islamic militants.
""I appreciate the effort of Mr. Putin to bring both Mr. Vajpayee and myself to the negotiating table,"" Musharraf had said.
""We have shown our determination for peace,"" he said. ""Let Mr. Vajpayee think of the consequences.""
Asked if he had shaken hands with Vajpayee during the 2 1/2 hour conference Tuesday, when they sat about 15 feet from each other, Musharraf said, ""No, I did not shake hands with him,"" in answer to a question.
Asked why, he said, ""because I shook hands with him once before and I thought there should be reciprocation. Maybe I was waiting for him to shake hands with me this time.""
He referred to the last time the two met, six months ago at a South Asian nations meeting in Katmandu, Nepal. At that summit, Vajpayee came down from the stage to offer his hand to Vajpayee, who took it with a faint smile, but later snubbed the Pakistani leader as the opening session ended. They did shake hands, however, on stage, when the conference ended the next day.
""Everyone was desiring a meeting between me and Mr. Vajpayee,"" he said. ""I think the whole world is disappointed that we two did not talk and meet here.""

The rebels died in seven clashes Monday, it said.
The highest toll was in the Syangjha district, where four Maoists were shot dead.
Security forces recovered arms and ammunition from the clash sites, including grenades, the ministry said in a statement.
The rebels also threw at least six bombs at a 200-kilowatt privately owned power plant in the far western district of Bhajang, cutting off electricity for six villages, officials said.
The fresh violence comes ahead of a state visit to Washington on May 7 by Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who is expected to speak with President George W. Bush about US aid for the crackdown on the Maoists.
The Bush administration has asked Congress for 20 million dollars in military assistance to the kingdom, as the Maoist insurgency takes on a new intensity.
More than 3,100 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996. Nearly half the deaths have come since November, when the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire.
Meanwhile, King Gyanendra donated two million rupees (27,000 dollars) to help civilian victims of the Maoist conflict and the families of soldiers killed in action since November.

""The suspension of the citizen's fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution since the imposition of the state of emergency cannot be viewed in a favourable light from the human rights angle,"" HURON president Sudip Pathak said in a letter appealing to all concerned.
He said HURON received daily reports of arbitrary arrests, custodial deaths and the disappearance of people in police custody.
""This raises doubts if such events do not show the government is flouting the laws,"" he said.
""It should be understood by all concerned that a state of emergency should not be a license for the government to indulge in lawlessness,"" he said.
Pathak called on the government make public the names of people arrested, allow them to meet with their relations, inform them of any charges against them and release those who are not charged.
""We believe the fulfilment of these conditions will keep alive the citizens' belief and faith in the concept of human rights and democracy,"" he said.
Pathak said the present situation was serious and sensitive, ""But the government, controlling all the state apparatus, will only flout Nepal's commitment of honouring human rights if it does not show any concern about granting the people their minimum rights.""
He also criticised the Maoists for refusing to hold talks with the government to end the violence.
""Although the government, the civilians and others wanted the Maoist problems to be solved through bilateral talks, the rebels have unfortunately seen no purpose in holding them,"" said Pathak.
""The Maoists' refusal to hold talks has pushed the country towards the path of violence,"" he said.
More than 4,300 people have died in Nepal since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy, according to the official count.

"164",20022055,"Title: President Bush Praises Pakistan.rtf; Date: January 1, 2002 Tuesday; Text: President Bush praised Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Monday for measures he has taken to quell terrorism, and urged Americans not to let down their guard in the new year.
After issuing a stern call to Musharraf to rein in terrorists like those who attacked the Indian Parliament Dec. 13, Bush said he was encouraged by Pakistan's arrest of a longtime leader of an Islamic militant group accused in the attack.
That attack killed 14 people and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. It has also threatened to undermine Bush's coalition against terrorism.
""He's cracking down hard and I appreciate his efforts,"" Bush told reporters at a restaurant before sitting down to a cheeseburger during his holiday vacation. ""Terror is terror, and the fact that the Pakistani president is after terrorists is a good sign.""
Bush said he had told Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he understood his anger over the Parliament attacks, but continued to hope war would not break out between the two neighbors.
The administration has been urging the two sides to open a dialogue. Officials noted that the Pakistani and Indian foreign ministers will be in Nepal on Wednesday for a regional conference. Musharraf and Vajpayee will be there later in the week.
Bush shook his head as he recalled speaking with interim Argentine President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa about that country's financial crisis on Saturday, only to have Saa resign a day later.
""Once they elect a president, we'll work with him,"" Bush said. ""But the future president has got to deal with the economic crisis at hand, and once they come up with a plan that'll sustain economic growth, then we're willing to work with them, and we're willing to provide technical assistance to the government through the IMF.""
Bush said there can be no letup in vigilance by the U.S. government or Americans against domestic terrorism.
""Let's just put it this way, that the administration and the government (are) on alert and have been since 9/11,"" he said. ""And the American people realize we have a new culture, and that is one of being vigilant.""
Terrorists have shown an inclination to strike around New Year's Day in previous years, and the third general alert issued by the administration last month runs through the holidays.
""We've got people working overtime during the holidays,"" Bush said. ""Anybody who tries to harm an American, there's a good chance we're going to get them.""
The government is focusing its efforts on ""making sure the public health system works,"" he said. He didn't elaborate, but the Senate last month passed a $3.2 billion bioterrorism package that boosts vaccine stockpiles and sends millions to local hospitals and clinics.
As U.S. marines pressed the hunt for Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, Bush said he remained confident Omar and Osama bin Laden will be captured or killed.
""All I know is that he's running,"" Bush said of bin Laden. ""And any time you get a person running, it means you're going to get him pretty soon. And the same with Mullah Omar. It's just a matter of time.""
Though he must confront recession and a complicated new phase in the war on terrorism, Bush said he foresaw a great year in 2002.
""People are going to be able to find work again,"" he said. ""It's going to be a great year because our military is going to do the job the Americans expect. It will be a great year because at home we'll protect the American people.""
Bush said he had no glamorous New Year's Eve plans outside of hosting three Texas couples at his ranch. He expected to turn in at 9 or 10 p.m., he said.
Asked about a resolution for 2002, he said: ""Eat fewer cheeseburgers.""

""Frequently isolated from the outside world in private homes, child domestic workers are extremely vulnerable to both exploitation and abuse,"" the ILO said in a statement.
""The ILO this week gathers government, employer and worker representatives from 16 countries in Chiang Mai to develop strategies to tackle this widespread problem,"" it said.
At the meeting held in this northern Thai city, which is also being sponsored by the Japanese and Korean governments, participants are aiming to draft national plans of action on child labour.
Delegates will also look at ways to eradicate the trade and establish support mechanisms for the rehabilitation of child domestic workers.
The ILO said an estimated 211 million children worldwide aged between five and 14 are engaged in some form of economic activity. About 60 percent of them live in the Asia-Pacific region.
""While most domestic child labourers are between 12 and 17 years of age, some are as young as five or six,"" the organisation said, adding that the trade is also linked to the illegal trafficking of children.
Thailand will later this month host a meeting aimed at fighting the growing human-trafficking business.
More than 150 experts from Asia and Europe are due to attend the Bangkok conference sponsored by the UN Development Fund For Women (UNIFEM).
Representatives from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam are taking part in the Chiang Mai meeting.

The U.S. statement quoted from a recently released rebel warning that said, ""During wartime, the unassuming traveler can be caught between the cross fire of the contending armies.""
The rebels, fighting since 1996 to end Nepal's constitutional monarchy, have announced they will impose a general strike April 2-6 across the Himalayan kingdom. Rebel violence also has increased in recent months.
More than 2,800 people have been killed in the insurgency. The guerrillas take their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung.
""Americans are strongly urged to maintain a low profile and to exercise special caution"" during that period, the U.S. statement said.
Tens of thousands of foreign tourists visit Nepal each year, drawn by its breathtaking Himalayan terrain, remote trekking routes, centuries-old Hindu ceremonies, and Mount Everest - the highest peak in the world.

"168",20022819,"Title: Marking one year on throne, Nepal 's king calls for end to rebel insurgency.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Wrapping up his first year on the throne he took after Nepal's royal family was massacred, King Gyanendra called for unity as the country's military battles Maoist insurgents.
""We should have the attitude of doing something for peace, development and good governance and take pride in being Nepalese and remaining Nepalese,"" the king said in an interview published Wednesday by the state news agency.
Thursday marks Gyanendra's first anniversary as Nepal's mostly ceremonial monarch, and there was no indication he would lift the emergency rule that has suspended civil liberties for Nepalese as the government seeks to crush the revolt.
Gyanendra's brother, the beloved King Birendra, was killed by Crown Prince Dipendra on June 1, 2001, in a massacre that left 10 royals dead, including Dipendra, who ended the palace blood bath by turning a gun on himself.
Many ordinary Nepalese refused at first to believe that Dipendra would kill his family. Gyanendra was not widely liked after he was crowned, although Nepalese have now grown to accept him.
""Our country, which in the past has remained a synonym for peace, is choking in a spate of violence, terror and destruction,"" the king said. ""We are still trying to find the underlying causes and will reach a constitutional resolution to the problem.""
Since Gyanendra was crowned, fighting between the rebels and government troops has intensified. The king approved emergency rule in November, after the Maoists broke a cease-fire, and has ordered the army to fight back.
The rebels are trying to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy, which gives an elected prime minister the power over day-to-day governance. The king stays out of politics and is largely a figurehead - when he declared emergency rule it was at the request of the government.
The rebels have refused the government's offer to bring them into the mainstream of Nepalese politics and end the violence.
More than 3,500 people have died in the fighting, mostly in the past six months. The rebels want to install a communist government, and they draw their inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong.
The king was asked what might finally stop the violence.
""If all concerned work sincerely and with dedication to understand the problems and hardship of the people and bring to them the fruits of democracy, the nation could move ahead,"" he said.
Under emergency rule, the government suspended a provision in the constitution that protects the freedom of opinion and expression, and the freedom to assemble peacefully. It also suspended the constitutional guarantee against prior restraint of news articles.
Authorities are also allowed to keep people locked up under ""preventive detention"" even though they have not been charged with any crimes.
Gyanendra also dissolved the parliament and ordered fresh elections on Nov. 13 at the request of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
Many have feared the government will not be able to hold the elections due to attacks by the rebels in mountainous areas, but the king said he expects the voting to take place.

A special celebration was organized at Lumbini, 480 kilometres (300 miles) south-west of Kathmandu, where Buddha was believed to have been born in 560 BC.
Thousands of devotees from the neighbouring Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar also took part, officials said.
Tibetan monks and refugees living in Nepal, where Hinduism is the official religion, also attended.
At the Swayambhunath monastery, one of the biggest in Kathmandu, relics of Lord Buddha were placed on a table protected by bulletproof glass and devotees paid their respects by touching the table with their foreheads, witnesses said.
The government banned all animal slaughter across the country for the day.
Around 8.0 percent of Nepal's 25 million people are Buddhist.
Caretaker Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in a message to the nation said the ""auspicious day"" was a chance for the people of Nepal to shun violence.

Four guerrillas were killed in a cross-fire with the security forces Wednesday morning in Kalikot district in midwest of Nepal and others were killed in Dailekh, Syangja, Achham, Banke and Rolpa districts of the western Nepal, the daily said, quoting a press release issued Wednesday night by the Nepali Defense Ministry.
Meanwhile, the security forces also arrested 14 other guerrillas and recovered large cache of arms and explosive materials across the country during their operations, according to the press release.
More than 600 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed a state of emergency on November 26 last year following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The six-year-long guerrillas insurgency has claimed more than 2, 500 lives, including army soldiers, policemen, civilians and the guerrillas, in the Himalayan Kingdom.

"171",2002863,"Title: Many Nepal Rebels Reported Killed.rtf; Date: May 8, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Fighting in western Nepal for control of a Maoist stronghold raged on Thursday as state radio reported that scores of rebels might have been killed.
The report, which couldn't be independently confirmed, said as many as 250 Maoist rebels might have died in the remote village of Gam, where fighting broke out late Tuesday after guerrillas surrounded a joint army-police, Radio Nepal said.
At least 104 soldiers and police were earlier reported killed in the battle.
Gam, a Himalayan expanse where the rebels' movement to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy began in 1996, was a Maoist stronghold for six years but has been under army control for two months.
After the Tuesday attack, the guerrillas regained control of the village, a senior official of the Royal Nepalese Army told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
Radio Nepal said army reinforcements had reached the area Thursday morning and that a gunbattle to regain the area followed.
Reports by the military, including the casualty figures, can't be confirmed as journalists and human rights groups have no access to the war zone.
As the fighting raged this week, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and President Bush met in Washington on Tuesday to discuss U.S. aid for Nepal. The Bush administration recently asked Congress for $20 million in non-combat assistance for Nepal.
Gam, located at an altitude of 6,560 feet, is the village where the Maoist insurgents - who have been fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy since 1996 - started their movement.
The rebels had held Gam for six years, administering a local government that levied taxes and ran a justice system, before the government captured the area in a fierce offensive this year.
On Wednesday, after several failed attempts to land in bad weather at Gam, army helicopters ferried soldiers to nearby areas and the troops were mobilized for an attempt to regain the lost area, the officer said.
The rebel attacks were a response to an air and land assault on a suspected guerrilla training camp in the Rolpa district, where Gam is located, 180 miles west of Katmandu. It was the biggest military operation in six years of fighting.
According to the army, at least 518 people, including more than 410 rebels, have been killed since Thursday in the once peaceful Himalayan kingdom. Other reports put the death toll higher by 200.
The Nepal government imposed a state of emergency in November that allowed the army for the first time to join police in fighting the rebels, who follow the doctrines of Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong.
Nepal's army has participated in international peacekeeping operations but had never fought in an internal conflict until November.
The recruitment of thousands of new soldiers began Tuesday at the Pattan military base in the capital.

The Indian premier also called on the international scientific community to speed up research into medicines to treat the disease and forge cooperation across political and geographical frontiers to help AIDS and HIV carriers worldwide.
""This global challenge calls for an effective global response because no country, however mighty economically and advanced technologically, can liberate itself fully from HIV-AIDS unless the entire human race can be liberated,"" Vajpayee told an eight-country conference in New Delhi.
India announced in March that it had 3.97 million HIV-positive cases, the largest HIV-positive population in the world after South Africa. Unofficial estimates put the figure at closer to five million.
Vajpayee said India's political groups and other communities were closely cooperating to stem the spread of AIDS.
""For all of us in India the spread of HIV and AIDS and taking good care of victims has become an urgent national task. It is a concern that is shared equally by the central and state governments, as also by all political parties.
""The Indian business community is beginning to realise its responsibility in contributing its might to the war on HIV and AIDS,"" Vajpayee told delegates from India, Brazil, China, Kenya, South Africa, Thailand, Nigeria and Nepal in the world's first conference of policy-makers of anti-AIDS campaigns.
""Much more needs to be done. We need to reach out to the illiterate and to those who are vulnerable to AIDS infection,"" Vajpayee said and called on religious leaders and social activists to join hands with the government to battle the disease.
""We should also activate trade unionists, school and college teachers, and, if necessary, the humble postman to carry the message of prevention being the only cure, at least so far,"" Vajpayee said.
The prime minister also asked the developing world to focus on country-specific research for vaccines against specific strains of the virus.
""The international research so far, has been focused on the 'B' sub-type of HIV, which is prevalent in the United States and Thailand. (In) India the 'C' type is prevalent. Therefore, we need a 'C' sub-type vaccine as quickly as all of you can develop it,"" he told the delegates.
India has said it will look towards South Africa and China for research collaboration and partnerships in developing its own India-specific anti-AIDS vaccine.
Last year the Indian health ministry, signed a pact with the US-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), to develop an anti-AIDS vaccine appropriate for use in India.
The first phase of clinical trials could start in New Delhi in late 2003.
South African parliamentarian Essop Jassat, who is participating in the conference, said his government could cooperate with New Delhi for vaccines against the 'C' type virus.
""We see in it a vast scope for cooperation and the results will vastly benefit us both,"" Jassat told AFP.
An estimated 4.7 million South Africans, or one in nine, are HIV-positive and some 1,600 people become infected with the virus everyday.
Both Vajpayee and Jassat called for changes in attitude and social behaviour to keep the disease at bay.

At least 26 rebels were shot dead overnight in a firefight when troops raided a rebel training camp in Rolpa district, about 400 kilometers west of the capital Kathmandu.
'More rebels could have died as the fighting continued late into the night in Lisne Hills of the district,' said Devendraraj Kanel, minister of state for home affairs.
Reinforcements were sent to the district Friday morning to assist government forces, he said.
In Doti district of far-western Nepal, troops on patrol encountered a group of militants carrying crude bombs Thursday.
'A firefight ensued and 25 insurgents were slain,' the junior minister said.
Nepalese newspapers reported Friday that up to 60 rebels were killed in the fighting in Rolpa district.
The government lost at least one soldier in the fighting, the Kantipur newspaper reported.
Amid the mounting government offensive, the rebels have proposed a new round of peace negotiations to end the violence wreaking the Himalayan kingdom.
The rebels, drawing their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy in the Himalayan kingdom.
Nearly 4,000 Nepalese including police, soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed in the insurgency so far.

Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who served as prime minister once before, will head a six-member caretaker Cabinet.
He heads the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.
""We have heard about the appointment, but we are still waiting for the announcement from the royal palace,"" said Prakash Chandra Lohni, vice president of the party.
The king held separate meetings Friday morning with the leaders of the six major political parties after a week's delay. The party leaders had said they wanted to have a voice in the formation of an interim government until elections can be held.
Gyanendra indefinitely postponed the elections that had been scheduled to start Nov. 13, when he fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Cabinet on Oct. 4.
Gyanendra's moves marked the first time since the end of Nepal's absolute monarchy in 1990 that a king waded into politics. The king still is seen by many here as a god, though his role has been mostly ceremonial.
Gyanendra dismissed Deuba after he asked the monarch to postpone parliamentary elections by a year because of the threat of disruption by rebels who have been fighting to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
Gyanendra ascended to the throne last year after his brother, King Birendra, and eight other royal family members were killed in a palace massacre. A government inquiry later found that the then-crown prince shot the other victims before taking his own life.

The attack took place in Guntur district's Vemavaram village, the news agency said, adding a police inspector was among the five killed by the blast.
Police blamed the attack on guerrillas belonging to the powerful People's War Group (PWG) Maoist outfit.
The blast occurred when a police party was returning after visiting the village where earlier Monday PWG rebels had attacked three houses and two shops.
The attack was similar to a landmine ambush by the PWG on September 19 which killed three police personnel in Anantapur district.
The Maoists have stepped up their campaign against Andhra Pradesh's politicians and policemen following the fracture of a peace dialogue between the rebels and the government in July.
The rebels have been fighting a three-decade battle for greater social and land rights for the state's indigenous tribal and landless farmers, in a conflict that has cost more than 10,000 lives.
State Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu last month had ruled out any new ceasefire with the PWG, saying it would only strengthen the rebels.
""Such cold-blooded murder of innocent policemen on duty would take the extremists nowhere and it only showed the cowardice act of the extremists"", he said Monday in a statement reacting to the lastest attack.
""In spite of repeated appeals to the extremists to shun violence and join the mainstream, they are indulging in mindless violence"", Naidu said, warning his government would try to stamp out Maoist-led attacks in the state.
Nepal has alleged that the PWG and other Indian far-leftists have ties to Maoist rebels in the kingdom waging a ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy which since 1996 has claimed some 5,000 lives.

Currently, there are about 200,000 Nepalese women working as prostitutes in Indian brothels and an additional 5,000 arrive every year, the daily quoted the study of the ILO as saying.
""It is known that the trafficking of women is carried out mainly for prostitution,"" the study said, adding that ""other motives include forced labor, sexual exploitation, organ transplants and involvement in circuses or other activities without prior consent of the victim"".
""26 districts in Nepal are identified as areas prone to the trafficking, and there are five main transit points for their departure to India through which the women are lured abroad with promises of 'good jobs',"" the study said.
The women trafficking appeared mainly due to the open border between Nepal and India. Most of those trafficked to India are in the age of 15 to 25, but 12-year-old girls are also found to have been smuggled to Indian brothels, the study noted.
To combat the problem of the trafficking, the Nepali government has enacted the Human Trafficking Control Act and the Trafficking in Human Beings Control Bill in recent years in a bid to eradicate the existing malpractice.

Police said the small bombs exploded early in the morning in commercial areas in Kathmandu. At least three other bombs were defused by security squads, witnesses said.
The blasts came ahead of a one-day general strike called for Monday by the Maoists to press their demand that a special assembly be convened to redraft the constitution.
The rebels are fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. Their ""people's war"" has left at least 4,700 people dead since its launch in 1996, according to official estimates.
The Maoists frequently call strikes in bids to show the support for their cause.
However, residents say the rebels have been ruthless in their attacks on anyone not obeying the strike, often attacking residents who dare to venture out or shopkeepers who do not down their shutters.
Security forces have appealed to transport companies to run as normal Monday despite the threat of violence.
Kathmandu has been rocked by nearly daily small bomb blasts since August 28, when a state of emergency was lifted. The emergency was imposed after the Maoists broke a ceasefire in November and had given authorities more leeway to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.
Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known by his alias ""Prachanda,"" or ""The Fierce,"" on Thursday proposed dialogue with the government to find a ""positive and peaceful"" way to end the insurgency.
The government rejected the offer as insincere, calling on the Maoists to show their goodwill through action, such as a renunciation of their demand for an assembly to redraft the constitution.
This position was echoed by a meeting of 10 parties Sunday, which called on the Maoists to declare a unilateral ceasefire.
But the parties also called on Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to be more flexible, in particular by giving up his insistence that the rebels lay down their arms before any talks.
The meeting included the ruling Nepali Congress as represented by Girija Prasad Koirala, Deuba's arch-rival and predecessor as premier. The party effectively split in two over Deuba's recommendation in May that King Gyanendra dissolve parliament and call new elections.
Deuba and Koirala are expected to run against each other at the parliamentary elections slated for November 13, two years ahead of schedule.

Pakistani officials denied this.
The drone, which takes aerial photographs, was flying nearly 2.5 miles inside Indian territory in the Poonch sector along the India-Pakistan border when troops fired at it, an Indian army official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Poonch is about 150 miles northwest of Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars in a bid to settle rival claims to the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley.
The shootdown came amid a massive buildup of troops along the border by the nuclear-armed countries. The Indian army spokesman said that after the drone was hit, heavy mortar and artillery fire by both sides erupted.
Pakistan denied the spy plane allegation.
""No Pakistani spy plane has been shot down by India in the Himalayan region of Kashmir,"" a senior military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan's state-run news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, reported that ""an aerial vehicle of India crashed in the Jammu sector and the military officials of India are indulging in baseless propaganda to hide this loss.""
The Indian army spokesman said it is very rare in ""peacetime"" that Pakistani unmanned aerial vehicles are spotted. The last episode was in 1999, after an 11-week armed conflict in the Kargil sector of Indian-controlled Kashmir.
In New Delhi, an Indian defense analyst said he didn't think Sunday's shootdown would lead to war.
""While an increase in armament usage is predictable after this incident, I don't think it would lead to a higher level of military hostilities because it was an unmanned plane and no lives were involved,"" said C. Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses.
""It was perhaps a probe by the Pakistanis … to test India's resolve on how it would respond to any form of intrusion,"" he said.
The army spokesman said that the aircraft was seen going down and soldiers were scouring the mountainous area to locate the debris. He said it was also possible that a part of the debris could have fallen inside Pakistan.
An Indian air force plane fired at the drone and then received fire from Pakistani anti-aircraft guns, he said, adding that the Indian plane was not hit. He said it wasn't clear whether it was fire from the plane or from the ground that brought down the drone.
Eyewitnesses said the appearance of the drone caused panic among Poonch residents, who thought war had broken out.
Since a Dec. 13 terrorist assault on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi, India and Pakistan have amassed thousands of troops along their 1,100-mile border, and are in a state of high alert.
India blames Pakistan's spy agency of sponsoring the attack on Parliament that killed 14 people, including five assailants allegedly tied to Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups. Pakistan has denied the allegations, demanding proof.
The United States, Britain and other nations have urged India and Pakistan to negotiate over New Delhi's demands that Islamabad crack down on those groups.
The shootdown came hours after Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke privately on the final day of a summit of South Asian leaders in Nepal. Though Musharraf called for dialogue, Vajpayee said there would be no talks until Islamabad made greater efforts to halt the Pakistan-based Islamic militants fighting in Indian Kashmir.
Indian troops in 1999 shot down an unmanned Pakistani surveillance plane over the western state of Gujarat. This was just after the Kargil conflict, which was triggered by anti-India guerrillas from Pakistan occupying strategic mountain ridges in the Kargil sector of the disputed border.

"183",20021947,"Title: China Declares Flood Emergency.rtf; Date: August 21, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Officials were given emergency powers Wednesday to combat floodwaters in central China's Hunan province, where tens of thousands of workers were trying to hold back the rising waters of a lake that threaten to swamp a city and farming villages.
In eastern Nepal on Wednesday, a landslide triggered by heavy monsoon rains swept through a mountain village, leaving at least 65 people feared dead, an official said. Helicopter flights to bring in relief material and rescuers from Nepal's capital Katmandu had to be postponed until Thursday because of bad weather.
The floods have swept away hundreds of thousands of homes from China to Bangladesh to India, displacing millions and leaving about 2,000 dead.
Evary year, the monsoons disrupt the lives of millions of people across South Asia. As the waters rise, they seek high ground and erect massive shantytowns from sticks and plastic sheeting. Once the floods abate, these victims head home to rebuild their lives.
In China, officials were given special powers to commandeer labor, land and materials under the emergency order declared for Hunan, a densely populated farming area where more than 100 people have died in flooding and landslides.
Some 400 soldiers have joined 850,000 civilians battling to hold off flooding in rivers and Dongting Lake, where water has risen to danger levels along hundreds of miles of dikes, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. Rains stopped Tuesday night and several days of dry weather were predicted.
The lake is bordered by Yueyang, a city of 600,000 people, and scores of farming villages, where hundreds of thousands more live. Many lie below the lake's level during China's summer rainy season and rely on dikes to hold back the water.
In Changsha, the provincial capital about 93 miles south of Yueyang, residents were preparing flood defenses to hold off the raging Xiangjiang River. The river, which flows into Dongting Lake, was running at its highest-ever recorded level, according to local newspaper reports.
""Into battle to save Changsha!"" the Changsha Evening News urged in a headline above pictures of houses in nearby towns covered in water up to their eaves.
The Zhishui, another river that flows into the lake, was also threatening to flood its banks, Xinhua said.
However, the Yangtze, China's mightiest river, which joins the lake at Yueyang, was opened again to navigation on Wednesday as a flood crest passed down-river, Xinhua said. The boat lock and water diversion channel at the construction site of the massive Three Gorges Dam had been closed over the weekend because of high waters, forcing passengers to traverse the section by bus.
Nationwide in China, nearly 1,000 people have been reported killed this rainy season.
Some 21 people died in a landslide and 6,000 are homeless in Hunan's Chenzhou County, said France Hurtubise, the Beijing-based regional spokeswoman for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
She said key tobacco crops were destroyed and washed-out roads blocked rescuers from reaching seven or eight badly damaged mountain villages.
""People would point out to me where their houses had been, and there was nothing there,"" she said. In neighboring Leiyang county, ""I was grabbed by a 76-year-old woman who was sobbing and said she had lost everything.""
In Yunnan province in China's southwest, 40 bodies have been recovered and 23 people are still missing from an Aug. 14 mudslide triggered by heavy rains in Yuxi county, a local official said. She would only give her surname, Chen.
Xinhua said last week that more than 600 houses in Yuxi were destroyed by the flow of mud and rock.
In South Asia, around 1,000 people have died in flooding since the heavy monsoon downpours began.
Worst hit has been the Himalayan nation of Nepal, where nearly 500 people have been killed and 250,000 left homeless by landslides and floods Most deaths have occurred in remote mountainous areas accessible only by helicopter. Other areas have been cut off as torrential rains have washed away roads.
Most of the residents of the remote village of Thapra were asleep when the landslide struck early Wednesday, said Lekhnath Pokhrel of the Natural Calamity Management Center.
""Initial reports said that 40 houses were swept away and at least 65 people are reported to be missing and feared killed,"" Pokhrel said.
The village, about 125 miles east of the capital, Katmandu, is in an isolated mountainous area with no roads to nearby towns. People use mountain trails to reach it.
Across the border, more than 10,000 people were shifted to relief camps as a dam in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh burst on Tuesday, releasing waters pent up from rains the past days, the area's administrator Rajesh Rajaura said.
At least 10 people were swept away by the torrent, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, at least 27 people have died this week from drownings, house col"

Laleh and Ladan Bijani have tried but failed for years to persuade doctors to attempt the risky procedure. German doctors concluded in 1996 surgery could kill one or both of the sisters because they share a vein that feeds blood to their brains.
Although doctors in Singapore believe the surgery is possible, they still have not reached a decision on whether the operation should proceed, said Keith Goh, a neurosurgeon at Raffles Hospital.
""We will work out the least dangerous plan and present it to the twins,"" he said. ""Most of the surgical plans concern how to get around that (vein) problem.""
X-rays and scans revealed two separate brains surrounded by one skull, Goh said. If the surgery is successful, the women will be left with palm-sized cavities on their heads, he added.
Goh said the decision will ultimately be up to the twins.
""They seem determined to go through with this,"" he added.
After a lifetime of sacrifices to accommodate each other, the women have said they do not want to live joined together any longer.
Their hopes of living separate lives were rekindled last year when they read about how Goh separated a pair of Nepalese infants who were similarly fused at the skull. The sisters arrived in Singapore on Nov. 20 from their home in Tehran, Iran to undergo medical and psychological evaluations.
Laleh hopes the surgery will allow her to pursue her dream of working as a journalist in Tehran, while Ladan wants to earn a graduate degree in law and move back home with their parents in Shiraz.

"185",20021609,"Title: Nepal King Appoints Prime Minister.rtf; Date: October 11, 2002 Friday; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra named the head of a pro-monarchy party the new prime minister on Friday, party officials said, a week after he fired the government and took political control of the Himalayan nation.
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, 63, who heads the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, was prime minister twice under the parliamentary democratic system installed in 1990 and once under the feudal, village-based political system associated with Nepal's former absolute monarchy.
""My first priority will be to restore peace and stability in the country for which I will try to open dialogue with the Maoist rebels,"" Chand said.
Chand and his nine-member cabinet was scheduled to take the oath of office at the royal palace Friday evening, the palace said.
The announcement was made as 4,000 supporters of the two biggest political parties held demonstrations to protest the king's firing of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba last week.
Waving flags and placards, the protesters marched through the streets chanting: ""Save democracy,"" ""Save our constitution."" Some carried flags of the two largest parties, the Nepali Congress and the Nepali Communist Party.
After a week's delay, the king held separate meetings Friday morning with the leaders of the six major political parties, but did not meet them jointly as they requested. The party leaders wanted to have a voice in selecting an interim government to act as a caretaker until elections could be held.
It was not immediately known what the king and the party leaders discussed, but it is unlikely that the leaders suggested the monarchist Chand as the interim prime minister.
The late King Birendra named Chand as interim prime minister during Nepal's transition from absolute monarchy to democracy in 1990. He was forced to step down after 11 days, when a coalition of top political parties formed an interim government and conducted an election in 1991.
Chand again became prime minister in 1997, in a coalition with the communist party that lasted six months. Chand could not hold onto his position because of feuds in his own party.
Under the absolute monarchy, when political parties were banned, he was prime minister for three years.
Gyanendra sacked the elected government last week, the first time since the end of absolute monarchy that a king has ousted an elected government and its leader, even though he has power to do so under the constitution.
Gyanendra indefinitely postponed the elections scheduled to start Nov. 13 when he fired Deuba. The king said Deuba was incompetent and incapable of holding the elections on time, after the prime minister asked for a one-year postponement because of fears the rebels would disrupt them.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to abolish democracy, the monarchy and vestiges of the feudal system. They increased attacks since the king accepted Deuba's request to lift a national state of emergency in August to allow for election campaigning.
The emergency was imposed in November after the rebels broke off peace talks. Under the emergency decree, freedoms of speech, press and assembly were restricted severely and people could be detained on suspicion of favoring the Maoists.
Gyanendra ascended to the throne last year after his brother - former King Birendra - and eight other royal family members were killed in a palace massacre. A government inquiry later found that the then-crown prince shot the other victims before taking his own life.

"187",2002822,"Title: Amputee Mountain Climber Remembered.rtf; Date: September 25, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Ed Hommer was a man who let little deter him from getting to the top of the world. Despite losing both of his legs after a plane crash, he made his way up some of the world's most intimidating mountaintops.
""Ed did not want to be known as a token climber because he was an amputee,"" longtime friend Tom Halvorson said. ""He wanted to be known as a climber. He never did anything the easy way.""
Hommer, of Duluth, Minn., was training for an attempt at Mount Everest when a basketball-sized rock struck and killed him as he climbed Mount Rainier early Monday. He was 46.
Hommer's body was recovered by helicopter about 70 feet from the base of Disappointment Cleaver, a popular route between the Emmons and Ingraham glaciers at the 11,700-foot level of the 14,411-foot mountain.
Three climbers who were roped with him were not injured. The park, in the central Cascade Mountains, averages about two to three deaths on the mountain annually.
An American Airlines pilot and divorced father of three, Hommer lost both his legs below the knee in 1981, when he crashed a small plane in a storm during a sightseeing tour of 20,320-foot Mount McKinley.
He and three others waited on the mountain for nearly a week. Two of them died - his brother-in-law and a friend. By the time rescuers reached the survivors, Hommer had suffered such severe frostbite that amputation of his legs was the only option.
Fitted with carbon-fiber and titanium prostheses, he won medical certification to fly commercial airliners. After working as a pilot for American Eagle from 1985 to 2000, he became an MD-80 first officer for American Airlines in 2000.
He also returned to Mount McKinley 18 years after the accident and became the first double amputee to reach the summit of North America's tallest peak.
""He inspired so many employees with his courage and relentless pursuit of his dreams,"" said Todd Burke, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline. ""His inspiration will live on in all who knew him.""
Hommer tried to scale Everest last year, but bad weather forced him off the mountain 3,000 feet shy of the summit. He had hoped to try again next year.
Brian McCullough, one of the climbers who rescued Hommer after the 1981 plane crash, was his climbing partner on Everest and recalled one day when they hiked several miles through loose rock.
""He wasn't just hobbling along,"" McCullough said from Talkeetna, Alaska. ""He had two ski poles. And I never saw him fall over.""
Hommer never complained, McCullough said, not even when his prosthetic legs left painful wounds on the skin below his knees.
""He could just bear it. It was an incredible thing,"" McCullough said. ""When he got in that mindset … he was so focused. He was able to transcend his disability.""
Halvorson made Hommer's prosthetic legs and climbed part way up Everest with him last year.
""In climbing, you've just got to get into a Zen and just throw one foot in front of another,"" Halvorson said, ""and he was like a machine that could just go and go.""
Hommer wrote about his resolve to show what he could do without his feet in a book titled ""The Hill."" Part of the book's profits go to a foundation he created called High Exposure, which provides prosthetics to the needy in Nepal and raises money for U.S. children who have lost limbs.
Great River Energy, an electricity company in Elk River, Minn., sponsored Hommer's Everest attempt and posted a tribute to him on its Web site after his death.
""Ed understood the risks involved in climbing,"" the tribute read. It also carried this quote from Hommer: ""The mountain ultimately decides who succeeds, who fails, who goes home and who doesn't.""

"188",20021460,"Title: Maoist rebels attack district headquarters, police post in northwest Nepal.rtf; Date: NA; Text: More than 100 people died in fighting between communist rebels and government troops in two remote villages in the Himalayan kingdom, the defense ministry said Friday.
A statement from the Defense Ministry said 56 policemen, four soldiers, three civilians and at least 55 rebels were killed in the two clashes, that came just hours after a government official said officials were trying to resume peace talks with the rebels fighting to abolish Nepal's monarchy.
The rebels rarely comment on their military operations and human rights groups seldom are able to reach battle sites to confirm government claims.
In Khalanga, 375 miles northwest of Katmandu, the capital, the fighting began just before midnight and continued until daybreak Friday.
The ministry said the bodies of 33 policemen, four soldiers, three civilians and 55 rebels were later recovered from the town. The dead civilians included the top government officer of the Jumla District.
The rebel casualty figure was likely to go up as security forces were still looking for more bodies scattered or hidden in the jungles nearby, the statement said.
In a separate attack Thursday night in the northwest, rebels killed 23 policemen and injured 13 as they swarmed over a station in the town of Tarkokat, said a district official. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
At Khalanga, the attackers blew up and burned government buildings and the smoke made it difficult for rescue helicopters to land, said the army officer.
Though both sides have expressed willingness to talk, neither has made real progress toward negotiations and the military forces have continued their offensives.
Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal had said on Thursday that the government was working with human rights groups to establish contact with the rebels and start peace talks.
""It is the Maoists who need to respond positively. Violence will not get them anywhere,"" Mandal said. ""The rebels need to agree to the talks and then we can set an agenda on what we need to discuss.""
On Wednesday, the leader of the rebels, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, repeated his offer to hold peace talks. He made the offer after a three-day nationwide strike ordered by the rebels.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began a violent campaign in 1996 to turn Nepal into a communist state.
The insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people, most of them after Nepal's king imposed a state of emergency in November 2001 and ordered the army to join the police in fighting the rebels.

"190",20021415,"Title: Nepal Maoists call two-day general strike for February.rtf; Date: December 27, 2002 Friday; Text: Maoist rebels on Friday called a two-day strike across Nepal in February to protest King Gyanendra's dismissal of the elected government, amid scattered violence around Kathmandu.
Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known by his alias ""Prachanda,"" or ""The Fierce,"" said in a statement the strike would be held February 13 and 14 to express anger against ""the suspension of the people's sovereign rights.""
The rebels are fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy. Maoist-affiliated groups have also called strikes in pockets of the country on Sunday on what would have been the 58th birthday of slain king Birendra and Monday for the 32nd birthday of Crown Prince Paras.
The February strike will also mark the eighth anniversary of the start of the Maoists' ""people's war."" The insurrection was launched in the isolated west of the kingdom, but the Maoists have been increasingly turning their attention to the capital Kathmandu.
On Thursday, a bomb planted by suspected rebels went off in a downtown office building, injuring 11 people.
And overnight, suspected Maoists shot two policemen who were on patrol in the capital, a home ministry official said. The policemen, Ramesh Kumar Mahat and Dhurga Sharma, were being treated in hospital Friday.
King Gyanendra on October 4 sacked the elected premier, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and replaced him with staunch royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who will serve until new elections are called.
The king has been more interventionist than his late brother, in November 2001 deploying the army for the first time against the Maoists after the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire.
Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were shot dead in June 2001 by the drunken crown prince, Dipendra, who turned the gun on himself.
On Friday, rebels trashed a house belonging to Princess Helen Shah, a survivor of the palace massacre, in the Nawakot district, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) west of Kathmandu, local officials said. She was away at the time and no one was injured.
The Maoists also overnight blew up a statue of the king's father Mahendra in the courtyard of a secondary school in the Siraha district, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) south of Kathmandu.
Mahendra had in 1960 imposed absolute royal rule, which lasted until 1990 when Birendra agreed to a constitution amid massive pro-democracy protests.
The Maoist rebellion has left dead 7,774 people, most of them guerrillas, according to army figures released Thursday.

"191",2002162,"Title: Bombing in Kathmandu greets royal-appointed premier.rtf; Date: October 12, 2002 Saturday; Text: A bomb planted by suspected Maoist rebels Saturday destroyed a statue of a former king in Nepal's capital, killing one, hours after King Gyanendra infuriated the political establishment by appointing a monarchist prime minister.
The early-morning bombing at a busy Kathmandu intersection left one dead and eight injured, four of them critically, witnesses said.
It demolished a statue of king Mahendra, the current monarch's father, who had established 30 years of absolute royal rule in 1962.
""The sound of the blast was so loud that it jolted me out of my bed,"" said Narayan Manandhar, a resident of the capital's Kalimati area. ""Blood is splattered everywhere.""
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but immediate suspicion fell on Maoist rebels who have been waging a six-and-a-half-year insurgency to topple the monarchy.
The leftist guerrillas have vowed to take full advantage of a political crisis in the kingdom and hold a general strike November 11 to 13 ""against the authoritarian and reactionary king.""
Gyanendra on October 4 sacked elected prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent"", and assumed power for a week.
On Friday the king appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a staunch monarchist close to Gyanendra, to head a government that will be in place until new elections are held.
The king has suspended a parliamentary vote due to begin next month and no new date has been set.
Chand said Saturday he would try to initiate dialogue with the Maoists.
""The government's top priority will be to maintain law and order and good governance and to control the Maoists' terrorism,"" Chand told AFP.
""In the process of establishing peace and security, we are keeping the door open to dialogue with the Maoists.""
The insurgency has left some 5,000 people dead since 1996, according to government estimates.
Chand, a 62-year-old man of letters who has been premier three times before, is widely respected in Kathmandu but political parties have reacted angrily to his appointment.
In rare open criticism of the king who is revered as divine by many traditionalists, party leaders accused Gyanendra of overstepping his authority.
Deuba, the sacked premier, has alleged ""a conspiracy against the democratic system.""
His ouster was the first time the king had taken full control of Nepal since Gyanendra's late brother Birendra gave up absolute rule in 1990 amid massive pro-democracy demonstrations.
Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a mainstream communist who was the chief opposition whip in the dissolved parliament, said the new government would face grave challenges in fighting the Maoists.
""The government can't be successful without the support of the public and parties,"" he told AFP. ""Instead of helping solve the problems the country is facing, the king has opened a confrontation.""
Former foreign minister Chakra Prasad Bastola said ""the government is faceless and may not be able to win the people's confidence.""
""It has no mandate,"" he said. ""It hasn't been made clear to whom this new government is accountable.""
Gyanendra assumed the Shah dynasty's throne in June 2001 after Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were shot dead at their Kathmandu palace by the drunken crown prince Dipendra, who then turned the gun on himself.
He has shown a more interventionist approach than his slain brother, deploying the army against the Maoists in November for the first time.
Some observers said the political parties, with their bitter infighting and disgraced leaders, bear partial responsibility for the crisis. Nepal has averaged a new premier nearly every year since the restoration of democracy.
""Unemployment, corruption, poverty and divisions within the parties have allowed this situation to come about and given the king this opportunity,"" said former parliament speaker Ram Chandra Paudel who was active in the 1990 democracy movement.
""If this situation continues, it may pose a grave threat to Nepal's nationhood itself,"" he said.

A total of 298,066 tourists came to Nepal by air in 2001 as compared to 376,500 in the previous year, the daily quoted Pradeep Raj Pandey, chief executive officer of Nepal Tourism Board, as saying.
According to the tourism entrepreneurs, the tourist arrivals declined mainly due to the unfavorable internal and international situation in 2001, such as the Royal Palace massacre on June 1, in which almost all the royal family members were killed, the escalating guerrillas violence in the country, the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 and the following U.S. military strikes at Afghanistan.     
To revive the declining tourism, the Nepali government has taken a number of initiative recently to attract tourists, including reducing visa fees, ease visa procedures and opening up more peaks for trekking and expeditions.
Tourism is one of the major foreign currency earners for Nepal, which boasts of unique landscapes and cultures, and earns about 170 million U.S. dollars for the Himalayan country every year.

Raymond David Caughron, 58, an energy management consultant from Berkeley, California, died while climbing the 8,463-meter (27,900-foot) Mount Makalu, the ministry said. His body was found Friday by two members of a separate Swiss expedition team at a height of 7,200 meters (23,735 feet).

The tragedies come as the poor Himalayan nation struggles with annual monsoon rains that have killed more than 500 people in the past month.
On Thursday, a Canadian-built Twin Otter carrying 13 Germans, an American, a Briton and three crew members slammed into a hillside as it approached the western resort town of Pokhara, killing everyone on board, Pokhara police chief Kumar Koirala said.
The tourist flight was coming from Jomson, a popular trekking route and Hindu religious site.
Bad weather had initially hampered the rescue effort, but an official at the Katmandu airport said all 18 bodies of people on board were later recovered and flown to Katmandu. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
The names of the passengers were not immediately available. The plane was owned by private domestic carrier Shangri-La Air.
Also in western Nepal, a bus driver was trying to pass another vehicle on a mountain highway Thursday when he lost control, sending the bus into the rain-swollen Trishuli River. The 45 people on board were feared dead, police official Shyam Gharti said.
The accident took place at Nagali Khola, about 70 miles west of Katmandu.
""The bus had been stalled for over 14 hours last night due to a landslide and the driver was probably in a hurry to finish the journey,"" Gharti said.
In eastern Nepal, rescuers used army helicopters Thursday to reach a mountain village where a landslide is feared to have killed at least 65 people.
The landslide struck Wednesday and initial reports said 40 houses had been destroyed in Thapra village in Ramechap district, 125 miles east of Katmandu, police officer Harendra Shah said.
The Russian-built MI-16 cargo helicopter had been unable to fly to the site of the disaster earlier due to incessant rain and dense fog. It brought blankets, food and medicine.
Shah, who spoke by phone from the district headquarters Manthali, said they had not heard back from the rescuers who had reached the site.
Monsoon floods and landslides have wreaked havoc in this Himalayan kingdom and other parts of South Asia - including neighboring India and the low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh. Over 1,000 people have died in the region and more than 25 million have been displaced since June.
Wednesday's landslide struck as the Nepalese government had predicted that the weather had improved and authorities announced that they were wrapping up efforts to rescue victims of other weather-related disasters.
At least 512 people have been killed in flooding, landslides and other disasters in Nepal in the past month.

"198",20022460,"Title: India , Pakistan foreign ministers smile, shake hands and chat.rtf; Date: January 2, 2002 Wednesday; Text: The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan shook hands, smiled and chatted ahead of a South Asia summit here Wednesday, after weeks of escalating military tensions that brought the nuclear rivals to the brink of war.
A senior Nepalese official involved in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit said India's Jaswant Singh and Pakistan's Abdul Sattar had greeted each other warmly.
""After all they are good friends,"" the official said. ""There is a lot of goodwill and a lot of friendship.""
Singh and Sattar came together with foreign ministers from all seven SAARC member nations for closed-door talks that will pave the way for the grouping's full summit meeting that begins Friday.
It was the highest-level interaction between the two countries since last month's militant attack on the Indian parliament triggered a massive military build-up on their common border.
India says the attack was carried out by two Pakistan-based militant groups at the behest of Pakistani military intelligence.
The ministerial meeting was held up by more than two hours as Singh, the last man in, was delayed due to dense fog in the Indian capital New Delhi, officials said.
They said Singh offered prayers shortly after arrival at a temple dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.
India has ruled out any direct talks on the SAARC sidelines between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, but has left the door open to a possible bilateral dialogue at other levels.
The SAARC foreign minister talks are primarily aimed at finalising resolutions to be included in a declaration at the end of the three-day summit on Sunday.
Ministers from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are taking part in the first meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers since May 1999 in Sri Lanka.
SAARC foreign ministers were originally intended to meet at least twice a year and summits should have been held annually.
The last summit was held in July 1998, since when disputes between perennial rivals India and Pakistan have derailed all attempts at holding another conference.
SAARC was established to promote stability in a region which is among the most volatile in the world, with constantly simmering bilateral tensions and long-running internal conflicts.
The agenda in Kathmandu includes terrorism, expanding commerce within the region, curbing the drug trade and the trafficking of women and children as prostitutes, and cleaning-up the environment.
But inevitably, the summit will be dominated by India-Pakistan relations which are currently at their lowest ebb since their 1971 war.
India is expected to lay out its case against Pakistan as a sponsor of ""cross-border terrorist activity"" in the knowledge that this particular SAARC meet will have an international audience.
India and Pakistan do not have a monopoly on conflict in South Asia.
More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's long-running Tamil separatist war and a Maoist rebellion in Nepal has claimed more 2,300 lives since 1996.
Bhutan has its own share of problems along the border with Nepal and is currently trying to push out several Indian separatist groups which operate from bases just inside the Bhutanese border.

"199",20022329,"Title: Group_ Nepal Holding 11 Journalists.rtf; Date: January 25, 2002 Friday; Text: The Nepalese government has arrested 41 journalists since imposing a state of emergency last year, and still detains 11 of them, a media group said Friday.
Despite international pressure, the government continues to detain journalists, said Taranath Dahal, general secretary of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists.
""The Nepalese media has not crossed the limitations set by the emergency and yet the government continues to harass the media and arrest journalists without showing a cause,"" Dahal told The Associated Press.
A state of emergency was declared Nov. 26 in this Himalayan kingdom by King Gyanendra after Maoist rebels ended a 4-month-old cease fire and attacked police, army and government installations.
The government instructed the media not to publish any articles about, photographs of or statements from the rebels.
Immediately after the emergency was imposed, police detained almost a dozen journalists working for leftist newspapers and shut down offices of the Jana Disha daily and the Deshabodh monthly newspaper described by the government as a rebel mouthpiece.
However, in ensuing weeks, journalists working for independent media also were detained by the army or rounded up for questioning.
""We have sent a list of journalists to the government demanding their immediate release. If these people are involved in other activities besides journalism, we have nothing to say. But the government should not harass professional journalists,"" Dahal said.
The Paris-based Reporters without Borders said it has written to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba demanding that the jailed journalists be allowed to appear in court.
In June, police arrested journalists working for the nation's leading newspaper, Kantipur, for running a piece by a Maoist leader urging the military to stop defending the palace after a massacre almost wiped out Nepal's royal family.
The newspaper's editor, managing director and director were detained for a few days and released on bail. The government later withdrew the case against them.
The guerrillas have been fighting in remote mountainous areas since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy. The insurgency has killed more than 2,200 people.

'We heard some five soldiers were killed and about a dozen others were injured,' Insp. Gen. of Police Pradip Shumsher Rana told Kyodo News.
The rebel attack came when troops from a mobile army base in Damachaur were on an evening patrol of the district.
The troops fired back, inflicting heavy losses on the rebel side, he said.
However, it is not known how many rebels were killed in the counterattack, Rana added.
The Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) took up arms against the government in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and end multiparty rule. Nearly 5,000 Nepalese have been killed in the insurgency so far.
The attack Wednesday is the first major one by the rebels since Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dissolved parliament on May 22 for fresh elections scheduled for Nov. 13.
The prime minister dissolved the house after his ruling Nepali Congress Party disallowed him to extend the state of emergency imposed late last year to fight the communist rebels.

"201",20021953,"Title: Floods empty waterfront along China's Dongting Lake, but dikes holding with no rain forecast.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Once bustling streets along the shores of central China's flood-swollen Dongting Lake were a maze of ghostly canals Thursday where houses and shops bore signs of their occupants' hurried departures.
Some 800,000 workers shored up dikes in Hunan province against the near-record levels of the lake and the Xiangjiang River, which flows through the provincial capital, Changsha. Officials feared the water could burst embankments and inundate villages in densely populated farm areas.
No rain fell Thursday and skies were expected to stay clear in the area for at least two days.
Across China, flooding and landslides set off by torrential rains have killed nearly 1,000 people this summer. More than 200 deaths have been reported in Hunan, where local officials were given emergency powers this week to commandeer labor and materials to reinforce flood barriers.
Floods and landslides brought by monsoon rains have killed another 1,000 people in South Asia, at least 494 of them in Nepal. Rescuers were still waiting Thursday for rains to clear so they could reach a mountain village in the east where 65 were feared dead in a landslide.
At least 376 people have died in India this rainy season from weather-related causes, including 10 washed away when a 125-year-old dam burst Wednesday during a torrential rain. Floods in Bangladesh have killed 158.
In China, the flooding has been the worst since 1998, when 4,150 people were killed along the Yangtze River in central China and in the northeast. Total figures for property damage across the vast country were not available, but thousands are believed to be homeless.
Near Dongting Lake alone, about 1,000 homes have been evacuated, the Hunan Civil Affairs Bureau said.
In Yueyang city, where the lake links with the Yangtze River, life along the waterfront continued almost as normal. Vendors dished out food, barbers gave sidewalk haircuts and crowds gathered around chess and mahjong players. Fishing boats and ferries continued to arrive at the piers.
But a few yards away, empty houses stood flooded almost as high as their doors. Laundry hanging on lines dangled inches above the water. Toothbrushes and mugs sat on window sills.
""The people left as soon as the waters started rising,"" said a fisherman from his boat.
In some shuttered shops, floodwater lapped at hastily stacked chairs and tables. Merchandise sat abandoned in warehouses.
Luckier residents with just ankle-deep water in their homes waded about, drying out clothes and furniture in the hot afternoon sun. One man fished from the roof of a shack.
Others in the city of 600,000 moved belongings to drier ground by boat through chest-high waters.
The 1,560-square-mile Dongting Lake - China's second largest - has long been the scene of chronic flooding. It connects to both the giant, flood-prone Yangtze and to rivers that carry water from Hunan's southern mountains, and rises with their flow in the rainy season.
Conditions have grown more dangerous over the centuries as settlers used dikes to reclaim farmland from the lake, shrinking its size and leaving it little room to swell in flood times.
At Chenglingji on the lake's eastern shore, buildings outside the town's levee stood in five feet of dirty green water. People with boats ferried neighbors to dry land. Some living on the ground floor had moved their belongings upstairs.
""Of course it's a bunch of trouble. But what can we do?"" said Wang Guoqing, a dock worker.
Makeshift bedrooms and kitchens were set up and rooms converted to pens for chickens and geese. Children played with dolls while men smoked and read newspapers. Some threw fishing lines off balconies and shouted excitedly to neighbors when they caught something.
Wang, who moved his possessions upstairs Monday, said he was optimistic the water would soon recede. ""The waters come fast, but they also go down fast,"" he said.
More than 8,000 soldiers worked with the 800,000 civilians in shoring up dikes in six cities, the Hunan province propaganda office said. Dongting Lake, which is bigger than Luxembourg, is surrounded by 580 miles of dikes.
China Red Cross in Beijing said Thursday it had delivered $545,000 worth of supplies to Hunan since the start of the flood season in June, including medicine, rice, clothes and thousands of tents.
An additional $3.4 million has been provided by the central and provincial government, along with 200,000 pieces of clothing and thousands of tents and blankets, the state news agency Xinhua said.

Gyanendra assumed the throne after his brother and eight members of the royal family were killed by Crown Prince Dipendra, who also shot himself and later died in hospital.
On Wednesday, the king, Queen Komal and their daughter, Princess Prerana, moved into the Narayanhiti Palace, the traditional home of the Shah dynasty rulers. Their home is guarded by more than 3,000 soldiers of the Royal Nepalese Army.
Previously, Gyanendra and his family lived in their mansion in the capital, Katmandu, where Crown Prince Paras will continue to reside.
The royal family massacre on June 1, 2000 shook the Himalayan kingdom, and set off violent protests across the country, as people refused to accept that their popular king had been gunned down by his son.
Even while he was in a coma, Dipendra was named the monarch by the Royal Council. He did not regain consciousness, and Gyanendra, who had been named his nephew's regent, was enthroned as king after Dipendra's death.
For months, Gyanendra was at the center of conspiracy theories that linked him to the murders - allegations the palace denied. A government-appointed committee found Dipendra solely responsible for the slayings.

In a statement made available to the media Friday, Prachanda president of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), called on the Nepalese people to unite against the move.
The underground Maoist party is leading a communist rebellion wracking the Himalayan kingdom.
An easier way out of the present political deadlock would be restoration of the parliament dissolved last May and a new political solution sought through dialogue, the rebel leader said.
'There is no doubt that this (postponement) is another conspiracy against our party's proposal to end the present state of civil war in the country through a roundtable conference and talks and dialogue,' he said in the statement.
'If somebody has dreamed of being secure by intensifying the civil war with postponement of elections and an all-party government, that dream will not come true,' Prachanda, also known as Puspakamal dahal, said.
Deuba asked the king Thursday to announce a new voting schedule, saying the elections planned for next month cannot be held because of growing rebel violence. He recommended the polls now be set for November 19, next year.

At least 11 were gunned down on the spot in Banke district, three in Dang district, all located in western Nepal, and six were killed in the eastern district of Okhaldhunga, while another eight were killed in other districts, the press release said.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fires with the government security force, the press release said, adding that the government security forces also seized some arms, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations in these districts.
More than 1,000 guerrillas and over 300 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year. This followed the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the security forces after they broke a four-month- long cease-fire talks on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government has initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 4,000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

"205",20021020,"Title: Nepal 's ruling party in crisis talks over elections row.rtf; Date: June 16, 2002 Sunday; Text: Hundreds of members of Nepal's ruling party were due to meet Sunday to discuss a bitter internal row which could split the party over caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's decision to hold early elections.
The Nepali Congress (NC), led by Deuba's arch-rival and predecessor as premier Girija Prasad Koirala, last month expelled the premier from the party for three years to protest his decision to disband parliament and call elections two years early.
Koirala was angered that he made the move without consulting the party.
The move blocks Deuba from contesting the elections as an NC candidate and looks set to split the party as his supporters are considering forming a breakaway party.
Deuba has called a general convention of the party in Kathmandu beginning Sunday afternoon to discuss the matter and up to 1,000 delegates from around the country are expected to attend.
Deuba's supporters say they will try to remove Koirala from the post of president of the party, which has ruled the kingdom for most years since the restoration of democracy in 1990.
""If Koirala does not reconsider the appeals… the convention will outvote him and elect a new leader,"" Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka said.
Currently a two-thirds majority vote of the convention is required to remove a party president.
""Sunday's meeting, which will later convert into a general convention, will amend the party rules related to the removal of the party president and composition of parliamentary party (council members) by a majority of votes,"" Khadka said.
On Saturday Khadka said his faction of the party had given Koirala until Saturday evening to withdraw the expulsion order against Deuba or face a split in the party.
""We have given an ultimatum to Mr Koirala to withdraw the expulsion order of Deuba or face division in the Congress party,"" he said.
""If he does not take back his orders, then no one can avoid the division in the party which will be very unfortunate,"" added Khadka, who is also the convenor of a political mobilization committee of pro-Deuba NC leaders.
Delegates at the convention will be able to make speeches on Sunday and will decide if there are to be new rules for the party on Monday.
Koirala's supporters said the convention itself was ""illegal"" as Deuba had been expelled from the party and had no right to call the meeting.
On Friday Koirala indicated he could be prepared to withdraw the expulsion order if Deuba admitted his mistakes and moved to reinstate the dissolved house, party sources said.
Deuba took the decision to dissolve parliament after it looked as though it would defeat his proposal to extend emergency rule, which was imposed in November to counter an increasingly violent Maoist insurgency.
The Nepali Congress currently has a 113-seat majority in the dissolved 205-member parliament.

The helicopters had been sent from the capital Kathmandu to villages in Khotang district, some 192 kilometers (120 miles) to the northeast, but the monsoon downpour stopped the choppers from landing in the muddy villages, local official K.B. Thapa said by telephone.
He said 87 houses were washed away early Monday when 500-meter (1,650-foot) tall landslides swept down on the villages near Mount Everest.
Officials had earlier estimated that 35 homes had been destroyed by the disaster, which struck as most residents were sleeping.
Teams have recovered 52 bodies from the rubble but another 100 people are still unaccounted for in the villages of Dipsung and Sikundel.
Helicopters, however, have reached nearby areas, to which some 2,000 villagers have fled by foot fearing further landslides.
Thapa said 16 people have been airlifted by helicopter to Kathmandu for treatment.
Rescue teams have been operating in the devastated villages but additional supplies have been arriving slowly because of the remoteness of the area. No major roads run to Khotang, with a land trip from Kathmandu to the district headquarters Diktel taking at least six hours.
The massive landslides were caused by 72 hours of continuous rain that lashed northeastern Nepal.
Hundreds of people die each year in the kingdom as the monsoons sweep from the Himalayas into villages often poorly equipped to deal with flooding.
The heavy South Asian monsoon rains have marooned an estimated one million people and killed at least five in neighboring India. They have also submerged about one-fifth of Bangladesh.

"207",20021829,"Title: Kingdom of Everest fears end of dolphins.rtf; Date: September 30, 2002 Monday; Text: Nepal, home to the tallest mountains in the world, is losing a resource thousands of meters (feet) below -- rare dolphins that swim in the kingdom's rivers.
Nepal's dolphins, who are between 1.5 and 4.5 meters (five and 15 feet) long and weigh between 150 and 200 kilograms (330 and 440 pounds), are on the verge of extinction as a fast-growing population encroaches on their habitat.
The endangered mammals are found in only four of Nepal's rivers, all in the Kailali district some 480 kilometers (300 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu.
Official studies put the number of dolphins at only 100, down from 250 just a few years ago.
Vijaya Raj Shrestha, secretary of Nepal's Dolphin Protection Centre, said the dolphins faced an uphill swim against human settlement and official indifference.
""Man's cruelty against nature has added to the problem of protecting these animals,"" he said.
""The government's apathy towards the problem of preserving them also can be ascribed as the cause of the possible extinction of the animal in the near future.""
The dolphins do not restore their ranks quickly. Female dolphins take two years to hatch each of their young, Shrestha said.
River dolphins, like those in the sea, are highly intelligent.
References to them in India's Ganges river can be found in artefacts dating back to 246 BC, the time of king Asoka.
The king converted to Buddhism after witnessing a brutal war and then banned the killing of several species of animals, including the river dolphin.
But today Nepal's dolphins are losing breeding space at an alarming rate as the country builds more roads and bridges along their habitat. Development is eroding river banks, sinking the water in which the animals live and find their main source of food, fish.
Careless local people also dump waste into the rivers, including the carcasses of dead animals, polluting the habitat, experts said.
And the forests that surround the western rivers are under attack as residents chop down the wood for their own use.
""Those fishing in these rivers the dolphins inhabit also use venomous baits and powerful explosives,"" said environmentalist R. K. Joshi.
Activists can count at least one success. Local residents' custom of killing the animals for ""traditional medicine"" has been curtailed, Joshi said.
But environmentalists say there is still much more work to be done if the dolphins are to survive.
""In these past four years, the Centre for Dolphin Protection has drawn the attention of the concerned authorities to check the decline in the dolphins' number,"" Shrestha said.
""However, nothing has been done so far,"" he said.
Bhoj Raj Shrestha, president of the Centre for Dolphin Protection, said authorities needed to wake up if they hoped to save the rare wildlife.
""They should listen to our requests and do what is needed to protect the dolphins from disappearing forever,"" he said.

Devendra Raj Kandel, the state minister for home affairs, said the government was committed to the November 13 poll date, although voting may take place in phases.
He said the government has sought a clarification from Nepal's police chief Pradeep Shumshere Rana, who Thursday told a meeting called by the Election Commission that the vote should be postponed until mid-April in the wake of a string of Maoist rebel attacks.
""In my view, the election should be postponed in view of the law and order situation,"" said Rana, whose 45,000 police were the main force battling the Maoists until the army was deployed last year.
The junior home minister said without elaborating: ""Necessary action will be taken (against Rana) if he cannot give a proper reply within three days.""
""The election will be held as previously scheduled November 13,"" Kandel told AFP. ""But it may be held in five and six phases with a gap of 15 to 20 days in-between each round to ensure security.""
Elections were called two years ahead of schedule when King Gyanendra, on the advice of prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, dissolved parliament May 22 as it looked set to defeat an extension of emergency rule.
The king instead prolonged the measures by three months through decree. The emergency expired August 28 and was greeted by a surge in Maoist violence.
Massive guerrilla attacks on police posts September 6 and 7 left dead some 115 policemen and soldiers as well as more than 250 rebels, according to figures from defense ministry officials.
Critics say a free election will be impossible with vast swathes of the kingdom under rebel control and other areas under the tight watch of security forces.
More than 4,700 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in February 1996.

Opposition parties have criticized Deuba for calling an election at the wrong time.

""They were the ones who created Taliban and even supported them monitarily. Now they are fighting the Taliban… If Pervez Musharraf and the Pakistanis have had a true change of heart, then they should start from Kashmir to fight terrorism,"" he added.
Earlier, speaking at a mayors conference, Vajpayee accused Pakistan of adopting double standards.
""You can't fight terrorism in Afghanistan and spread it in Kashmir. This can't go on… You can't see terrorism in two ways, it can't be seen in pieces, it has to be seen in totality,"" he said, adding Pakistan is also bound by UN resolutions against terrorism.
Vajpayee, who is due to attend a South Asian summit in Nepal this week, also derided Pakistan for insisting on evidence to prove militant groups based on its soil were behind the December 13 attack on Indian parliament.
""I think it is a useless debate,"" Vajpayee said. ""What debate do you want? The five bodies (of the attackers) outside parliament and the bullet marks on the building … what can be bigger evidence than this?""
Five armed suicide gunmen had entered India's parliament building compound on December 13, firing indiscriminately and trying to enter the building. Fourteen people including the attackers were killed in the incident.
New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the attack and has demanded the groups be banned and their leaders handed over to India.
Islamabad denies the charge but has begun cracking down on the outfits.
In the hard-hitting speech, Vajpayee also said New Delhi will never give up its right to self-defence.
""When we tested the nuclear bombs, the world boycotted us and sanctions were impsoed on us but we mangaged to pass through that period. I had said we shall not give up on our right to self defence and whoever tries to attack us, we shall put in all efforts to save ourselves,"" he said.
""… whatever weapon we get, we will use it fully for our self defence, and if the attacker dies in the process, it is his problem, not ours,"" the prime minister said.

A large number of armed rebels overnight Wednesday attacked a police outpost in Koilabas in the Dang district about 400 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu.
Six policemen are so far known to have been killed, a police official said, adding details of losses during the raid were still unavailable.
Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) rebels are leading a violent campaign to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republican state in Nepal.
More than 7,000 Nepalese have died since the outbreak of the communist insurgency in 1996.
Since October this year, the Nepalese government has been talking about initiating a dialogue with the rebels, but none has materialized.

The government has revised the visa charge, reduced royalty for the mountaineers to climb the mountain below 6,500 meters and opened up more than 100 new peaks for the climbers, the daily quoted Shankar Koirala, joint secretary at the ministry of culture, tourism and civil aviation, as saying.
""Under the new regulations, mountaineers applying for climbing the mountains in Nepal will receive permission within three days and without any charge. They need not to bring the recommendations from the alpine clubs of their respective country to get the permission for expedition,"" Koirala said.
""The new regulation has also restricted the age of the climbers, "" he said, adding that ""the climbers only above the age of 16 will be given permission to climb peaks in Nepal.""
He also noted that the Nepali government has not only worked for bringing in more climbers by the new regulations, but also taken a step for the welfare of the mountain porters.  
Tourism is one of the major foreign currency earners for Nepal, which boasts of unique landscapes and cultures, and earns about 170 million U.S. dollars every year.
However, tourist arrivals in Nepal have declined sharply in recent months. The major reasons are the escalating violence by the anti-government guerrillas in Nepal and the continuing terrorists threats to the world after the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 last year.

King Gyanendra made the pledge Wednesday during a meeting with President Jiang Zemin on the first full day of a six-day visit, the China Daily reported.
""(Nepal) will not allow the emergence of elements running against the development of Nepalese-Chinese ties,"" the paper said, quoting the king.
""It will not permit within its borders any activities that undermine China's interests,"" the king reportedly said.
Tibet, which China has ruled in often brutal fashion since 1951 and which shares about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) of border with Nepal, is of particular importance in bilateral relations.
About 35,000 Tibetan exiles have settled in Nepal over the past decades, forming an ongoing concern for Beijing.
At the same meeting, Jiang made a reverse pledge to offer ""moral support"" in Nepal's struggle with Maoist rebels, Nepal's ambassador to Beijing said late Wednesday.
""The Chinese president said that China condemns terrorist actions taking place in Nepal,"" Rajeswore Acharya told AFP.
""He said China stands firmly in favor of His Majesty's government in fighting the terrorism,"" the ambassador said.
Prior to the king's visit, which began Tuesday, a Nepal foreign ministry source said cooperation in the fight against the violent Maoist rebellion in Nepal would top the agenda.
Around 4,300 people have been killed since Nepal's ultra-left guerrillas launched their ""people's war"" for a communist republic in 1996, with more than half the deaths occurring in the past year alone.
Despite the rebels' reverence for communist China's founder Mao Zedong, Beijing has repeatedly repudiated the guerrillas and voiced support for Nepal's crackdown on them.
Nepalese ambassador Acharya said no specific cooperation in the combat against the rebels had been discussed in the meeting with Jiang.
""We did not ask for any concrete cooperation,"" he said. ""We hope for political and moral support from China, and that was assured.""
The two leaders agreed that the geographic proximity between Tibet and Nepal was a great advantage and would help in developing mutually beneficial cooperation, the China Daily reported.
Jiang urged exchanges to be stepped up among all levels of society, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.
Apart from visits by top leaders, exchanges should be increased between legislatures, political parties, industrial and commercial circles, the press and non-governmental organizations, the Chinese leader said.
The two governments additionally signed an agreement on Wednesday to upgrade trade along the Tibetan border with Nepal, and the promotion of tourism and transportation, Xinhua reported.
China and Nepal will make full use of the Lhasa-Kathmandu Highway to improve passenger and cargo transport, and make arrangements to protect border trade in barter or cash.
The agreement, which replaces a 1956 pact that expired six years ago, also includes measures to make religious pilgrimages easier, Xinhua said.

""I can consider going to the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) summit early next year provided infiltration and cross-border terrorism stops completely in Kashmir,"" Vajpayee told a news conference in this northern Indian city.
India accuses Pakistan of pushing Islamic guerrillas into the Indian-administered zone of Kashmir, where a Muslim rebellion has left more than 37,500 people dead since 1989.
Vajpayee also said that bilateral issues should not be raised up at the regional summit.
""Pakistan does not like to talk on any other issue other than Kashmir and Kashmir is not a SAARC issue and so there is no point in discussing Kashmir at the summit,"" the prime minister said.
Vajpayee said India's attendance at the summit also hinged on the SAARC making tangible progress in regional economic cooperation.
""Pakistan has not acted on the recommendations in this area agreed upon in previous SAARC meetings,"" the prime minister said.
SAARC has sought to forge two regional trade pacts, the SAARC Preferential Trade Agreement and the SAARC Free Trade Agreement, but India-Pakistan differences have hampered progress.
India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, with a dispute over the Himalayan state of Kashmir sparking two of their three wars since then.
India and Pakistan control parts of Kashmir and claim all of the scenic Himalayan region.

The NCP-UML standing committee on Tuesday, following a two-day meeting, gave ""a green signal"" for talks to begin on the modalities of the merger with the NCP-ML, which split away from the parent party because of disagreements over policy towards India.
The damage caused by the split was all too evident in the 1999 elections, in which the NCP-UML, previously the largest single party in parliament, saw the Nepali Congress take power with an overall majority.
""Had the party not split into two, it could have fared better against the Nepali Congress and even secured a comfortable majority,"" said political analyst Hari C. Shrestha.
The split and the animosity that accompanied it saw many disaffected members of the mainstream Nepali left join the now outlawed ranks of the NCP-Maoist.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a republic state in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed the lives of over 2,300 people.
The rebels have allegedly killed about 90 local activists and elected leaders of both the NCP-UML and NCP-ML in recent years.

"222",20022830,"Title: Yearender_ 2002, year of standoff between India , Pakistan by Xiong Changyi.rtf; Date: December 23, 2002, Monday; Text: by Xiong Changyi
NEW DELHI, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- The year of 2002 is a year of standoff between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack on Indian Parliament last December.
India and Pakistan amassed up to a million troops on their border earlier this year after India blamed Pakistan-based militants for the attack on its parliament.
The two countries came very close to war after the Indian Parliament raid last December and again in May when an army camp was attacked by militants in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir.
Tensions diminished after high-level international diplomacy, and both sides in October pledged to begin withdrawing their troops.
India said on Oct. 24 that it had begun withdrawing troops from the border. However, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan warned later that tensions with India would remain until the issue of Kashmir was fully resolved.
""Since India had initiated the process of pullback, we also reciprocated,"" Khan said. But ""the real solution to the tension between Pakistan and India will only be possible through starting the process of talks.""
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in later November sent a message of congratulations to Pakistan's new prime minister, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali.
Jamali was sworn in on Nov. 23 as Pakistan's first civilian prime minister since military President Pervez Musharraf seized power in a military coup three years ago, and then called elections as part of a pledge to return Pakistan to civilian democratic rule.
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes told Parliament that Indian and Pakistani troops were withdrawing to peace-time locations.
""I am sure it (the pull-back) is largely because the Indians have realized that Pakistan cannot be browbeaten. But it is also the role which the international community has played.""
Brajesh Mishra, the principal secretary to the Indian Prime Minister, told a BBC program that a minor incident would not now trigger a war between the hostile neighbors.
""There is no danger today, of a little spark, creating a conflagration,"" Mishra said.
Some dozens of people have been killed in a spurt of violence in Jammu and Kashmir since Nov. 22, including attacks on two Hindu temples, which India blamed on militant groups based in Pakistan.  Analysts say that the attacks are unlikely to lead to a fresh crisis.  
by Xiong Changyi
However, despite the easing of tension, the two countries have shown no sign of moving toward talks.
In Islamabad, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said that the new government wanted to move forward on India-Pakistan relations and suggested talks between leaders of the two nations.
But New Delhi insists Islamabad end what it calls ""cross-border terrorism"" before dialogue can begin.
Mishra, who is also the national security adviser to the Indian government, said, that Vajpayee's participation at a regional meeting slated to be held in Islamabad in January could be difficult ""in the absence of any substance to the summit.""
India has sought what it calls a climate of reconciliation before Vajpayee could travel to Pakistan for the summit of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC).
""If that happens, we could consider it. But in the absence of any substance to the summit, of course it is very difficult for the prime minister to go,"" Mishra said.
Pakistan has accused India of trying to sabotage the summit which can only take place if heads of government of all seven South Asian nations attend. The other members are Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal.
In an interview with foreign journalists, Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri said that the summit would be a good opportunity for bilateral talks between the two neighbors aimed at easing tension.
""You asked me whether something could be done quickly. Well, we have invited the prime minister of India to come to the SAARC summit. The ball is in their court now,"" he said.
He indicated, ""Every sensible Pakistani and every sensible Indian wants to improve relations between the two countries and we have suffered as a result of our bad relations.""
India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads over Kashmir, a mostly Muslim region in the Himalayas, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
India and Pakistan each control part of Kashmir and claim it all as their own.  They have fought two wars over Kashmir.
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training Islamic militants who cross the frontier to stage attacks in the Indian- controlled region.
Pakistan denies it provides the militants with material aid, but says it gives moral and diplomatic support to what it calls the legitimate struggle for self-determination by the Kashmiri people.

Nepal's prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, who also holds the portfolio of foreign minister, will inaugurate the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Council of Ministers' meeting.
SAARC, formed in 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Economic cooperation, social development and combating terrorism will be among the items for discussion during the meeting, but observers are more interested in whether the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan use the opportunity to hold talks to ease bilateral tensions.
Any dialogue seems near impossible in the context of hostile relations which centre around their dispute over Kashmir.
Around a million troops have been lined up along their border since an attack on India's parliament in December which New Delhi blamed on militants from Pakistan.
Tensions shot up again after an attack on an army camp in Kashmir in May which India again blamed on Pakistan.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf promised to crack down on the flow of rebels crossing the Line of Control -- the de facto border which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
But he admitted Monday that there was still a possibility small groups of militants were crossing over into Indian-administered Kashmir.
India reacted sharply to his comments, saying they confirmed their ""worst fears"".
At the SAARC meeting, Indian Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha and Pakistani junior foreign minister Imanul Haq will spend two days attending the same meetings and even sit down together for official dinners.
But India has ruled out formal dialogue until cross-border infiltration has ended and as Sinha arrived in Kathmandu on Tuesday, he said: ""There are no plans for any bilateral meeting with Pakistan.""
In January, a SAARC summit in Kathmandu attended by the leaders of the member countries was completely overshadowed by India-Pakistan tensions.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee refused to hold talks with Musharraf.
But later it was revealed that there had been informal contact between the two countries behind the scenes.
Foreign ministers or junior ministers from all the member countries are in Kathmandu for the meeting. Sri Lanka's foreign minister, Tyronne Fernando, cancelled his trip at the last minute because of a parliamentary vote at home, but his deputy will attend on Thursday.

Hussain's Intrigue Jewelers kiosk in suburban Pittsburgh was one of several across the nation searched by FBI agents hunting for ties to the al-Qaida terrorist network.
""They took everything, my paperwork, bills, my computer, my checks,"" said Hussain, 27, a recently discharged U.S. Army mechanic. ""I told them, 'I don't have any links to anything like that.""'
About 75 stores have been searched by investigators hoping to discover financial backing for terrorist groups, said a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The raids have taken place in several cities over the past two weeks, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and New York. Dozens of foreigners, mostly from Pakistan, have been detained or questioned.
The shop owners have been asked about their accounting practices and whether they send money to any foreign organizations on a regular basis. They also are asked whether they support al-Qaida or know anyone who does, officials said.
Immigration attorney Neil Rambana, who is representing three Pakistani men and a woman from Nepal arrested in a raid at the Governor's Square mall in Tallahassee, Fla., said the FBI and INS were on a ""fishing expedition.""
""There is no proof and no one has presented any evidence that would put these people under suspicion,"" Rambana said. ""This was all about abusing people's rights in the hopes that there were a few guilty people among them.""
The Immigration and Naturalization Service declined to comment on the raids, other than to acknowledge they had taken place. A U.S. official said more than a dozen people are still in detention following the raids.
Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said immediately after the raids that federal agencies were ""looking at illegal immigrants working at kiosks,"" but he refused to elaborate.
The largest raids took place between June 28 and July 2. Agents swept jewelry stores in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina. Since then, smaller raids have taken place in Texas, California and Massachusetts, officials said.
Most of the raids involved Intrigue Jewelers franchises, which are licensed through Gold Concept Inc., a Florida company owned by Orlando businessman Arif Rajan.
Rajan's attorney, Phillip Calandrino, said neither the company nor its owner have terrorist ties.
He said Rajan, a native of Pakistan and a U.S. citizen since 1991, has been cooperating with the FBI for several months and has voluntarily turned over company records to investigators.
""He is just like any small businessman that you might run into. He didn't do anything wrong,"" Calandrino said.
Calandrino said Gold Concept leases space for its franchisees, but doesn't supply jewelry and doesn't control the day-to-day operations of the businesses.
""They hire who they want. They do what they want, like any independent business,"" he said.
The company first came into contact with FBI investigators in September, Calandrino said, when an Intrigue Jewelers employee in Whitehall, Pa., came under suspicion for having spent hours photographing the World Trade Center days before it was destroyed.
Ashar Iqubal Butt, a Pakistani citizen, pleaded guilty in June to entering the country with an altered British passport and agreed to be deported. A judge delayed his sentencing until September to give agents more time to investigate Butt's 25 World Trade Center photographs, which he had developed the week of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Butt's lawyer has said the photographs were taken innocently and that Butt had come to the United States to work.
The raids have sparked outrage among some members of Muslim communities.
""These people are being confronted and in some cases terrorized based on no evidence,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""And even when the FBI says there is evidence, it is never anything anyone else is allowed to see.""

Finishing a speech in which he called for ""serious and sustained"" dialogue with India, the Pakistani leader said he wished to ""extend a hand of genuine, sincere friendship to Prime Minister Vajpayee"" and walked over to his seat to shake his hand.
""Let us together commence a journey of peace, harmony and progress in South Asia,"" he said to the applause of the crowd.
Vajpayee, who has ruled out one-on-one talks with Musharraf at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit that opened Saturday in Kathmandu, smiled and held Musharraf's hand as he rose in his chair.
India and Pakistan have been in an intense standoff since December 13, when the parliament in New Delhi was attacked by militants India says were working at Pakistan's behest.
India has withdrawn its ambassador from Islamabad for the first time since their last full-blown war 30 years ago and the two sides have been deploying military units to their common border.
Indian officials said villages came under intense mortar fire Sunday by Pakistani army units in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that is a focal point of the nuclear powers' half-century conflict.
The Kashmir dispute led to the deadlock of Musharraf and Vajpayee's last summit six months ago in the Taj Mahal city of Agra.
""Nothing can be achieved as long as there is tension and hostilities among any two of the members,"" Musharraf told the summit.
""It was with this objective of dissipating and reducing tensions that I undertook the journey to Agra last July,"" he said. ""My government remains ready to engage in a serious and sustained dialogue with India at all times and at all levels.""
In his speech, however, Musharraf made a number of veiled swipes at India, stressing that while Pakistan opposed terrorism, ""legitimate resistance"" was something different.
""Pakistan itself has been a victim of terrorism. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" Musharraf said.
""However, the concerted campaign against terrorism must also identify the causes that breed terrorism and drive hopelessness and desperation,"" he said.
""We need to distinguish between acts of legitimate resistance and terrorism,"" Musharraf added.
Vajpayee refused to meet Musharraf when the two were in New York a month ago for the United Nations General Assembly, and in the wake of the parliament attack he has insisted Musharraf take tougher action against anti-Indian Islamic militants in Pakistan before high-level dialogue can take place.
""It is not as if the door has been shut with Pakistan for a dialogue but under the present circumstances, when the seat of a democracy was attacked, a certain threshold was crossed,"" Indian spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said Friday.
Some had hoped that Musharraf and Vajpayee would meet Saturday at a resort near Mount Everest, but the event was called off after Musharraf arrived in Kathmandu late Friday.
But officials from India, Nepal and Pakistan have all indicated some informal meeting could be arranged on Saturday.
The Kathmandu summit, which began two years late because of Indian-Pakistani bickering, opened under tight security with Nepalese children reciting Hindu prayers for peace and a moment of silence for Nepal's king Birendra, slain with nine other royals in June.
Western countries have been encouraging dialogue in Kathmandu to calm what US Secretary of State Colin Powell called Friday ""a very dangerous situation.""
Powell said Washington was considering dispatching a special envoy to the region, as British Prime Minister Tony Blair continued a regional tour that began in Bangladesh.
He is scheduled to meet Sunday in New Delhi with Vajpayee, who Indian officials said intended to fly home as soon as SAARC proceedings finished that day. Musharraf will meet Blair the next day.

"226",20021027,"Title: SAARC ministerial conference ends with recommendation for free movement of journalists.rtf; Date: March 9, 2002 Saturday; Text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)- A three-day regional conference of information ministers ended Saturday with a call for free movement of journalists within the area and for better training of those in print and electronic media.
The information ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC, announced their next conference will be held in the Indian capital New Delhi in 2003.
Pakistani Information Minister Nisar Memon said experts from the SAARC member countries would meet to work out ways to improve the ability of journalists to move about in the region, which includes archrivals India and Pakistan.
Both countries placed their militaries on high alert after the December attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi which India blamed on Islamic extremists supported by Pakistani intelligence.
SAARC was founded in 1985 to promote regional trade, similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
However, the standoff between India and Pakistan has halted progress on more regional cooperation.
Besides India and Pakistan, other SAARC members include Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and The Maldives.

Foreign ministers from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries signed the documents in the presence of their leaders who are holding a summit here, giving effect to an agreement reached at the previous summit in Sri Lanka in 1998.
Tens of thousands of women and children are forced into prostitution in South Asian countries and some are held as sex slaves while an increasing number of children are deployed as combatants in the region.
The Regional Convention on Combating the Crime of Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution and the Convention on Regional Arrangements for the Promotion of Child Welfare in South Asia will now have to be implemented by member states with enabling domestic legislation.
""With these conventions we have expressed our concern for the protection of women and children,"" said Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who took over as chair of SAARC from President Chandrika Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka.
At the last summit in Colombo, SAARC leaders decided to widen the scope of the charter on preventing trafficking in women and children to go beyond the issue of prostitution.
However, member states of SAARC -- which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- have dragged their feet over ratifying UN conventions on protecting women and children.
Only Bangladesh has signed and ratified two key UN protocols on children engaged in armed conflict and prostitution.
Nepal and Pakistan have signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography but not ratified them.
Sri Lanka has only signed and ratified the convention on child soldiers. Colombo has a serious problem with children being used as soldiers by Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the island's northeast.
In Sri Lanka, there is also the problem of children, especially boys, being used for prostitution in coastal tourist resorts. Groups opposed to child sex estimate the number of child prostitutes on the island at between 10,000 and 40,000.
In Nepal and Bangladesh, poverty-stricken women are forced into prostitution either at home or often in brothels abroad.
Nepali activists said the conventions would fail to address the immediate problems on the ground.
""Both the conventions are basically too far away from the present critical situation,"" said Renu Rajbhandari, chairperson of Nepal's Women's Rehabilitation Centre, at a press conference in Kathmandu.
She said the conventions were less powerful than existing state laws, while the one on child welfare lacked a basic guarantee to protect children's rights.
Prem Dangal, from the All Nepal Farmers' Association, stressed that leaders needed to take a broad and participatory approach, including consulting rights groups, on social issues such as poverty or farming.

""It is important to make it clear that there have to be very clear rules, and the clearest is that there cannot be any support for terrorist activities,"" Blair told reporters ahead of scheduled talks later Sunday in New Delhi with his Indian counterpart, Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Blair was responding to a question as to whether he would urge Vajpayee to meet with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.
The British prime minister will fly to Pakistan on Monday, rounding off a South Asian tour which has turned into a US-backed mission aimed at reducing escalating military tensions between the region's two nuclear rivals.
""Everybody wants to see the situation brought under control and make sure that proper dialogue can begin,"" Blair said.
""But the starting point of any dialogue has got to be the complete and total rejection of these terrorist attacks,"" he added.
India and Pakistan have massed troops on their borders in the wake of last month's attack on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups.
Britain and the United States have expressed deep concern at the war moves and urged India to show restraint, while pushing Pakistan to crack down on militant outfits.
Hopes that a South Asia regional summit in Kathmandu might help reduce tensions came to nothing as the meeting -- attended by Musharraf and Vajpayee -- ended Sunday with no apparent breakthrough.
The leaders of the two countries did meet informally during the summit, but Vajpayee dismissed the interaction as an ""exchange of courtesies, nothing more.""
Musharraf said he was looking forward to ""formalising the interactions,"" while India continued to rule out a dialogue until Pakistan takes measures to clamp down on ""anti-Indian"" militants.
India accuses Pakistan of training and funding militants fighting to end New Delhi's rule in Indian Kashmir. Islamabad says it only supports an indigenous movement for self-determination in India's only Muslim-majority state.
India and Pakistan have fought two full-scale wars over Kashmir, which is divided between the two rivals and has been the thorn in the side of bilateral relations for more than 50 years since their independence from Britain in 1947.
Blair, who held several telephone conferences with US President George W. Bush before leaving on his South Asia trip, is only too aware of how carefully he will have to tread to avoid upsetting the sensitivities involved in a deeply complex historical rivalry.
India has always been especially wary of any attempt to internationalise the Kashmir dispute by bringing in a third-party mediator.
US statements that Washington was considering appointing a special envoy to help ease Indo-Pakistan tensions were welcomed by Islamabad and cold-shouldered by New Delhi.
""If the two sides can't talk to each other, then it is all right for a third party, whatever you call it, for facilitation or mediation to defuse tension,"" Musharraf told reporters at the close of the regional summit in Nepal.
""I don't see the need for a special envoy,"" was Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh's curt response.

The state-run Nepal Rastra Bank has frozen more than a dozen individual accounts held in commercial banks that were suspected of having been used to channel funds to Maoist rebels fighting an armed insurgency in the kingdom, according to the Kathmandu Post.
The daily quoted a high-level source as saying the central bank had frozen the unidentified accounts at the request of government security agencies.
The Maoist rebels, fighting for a republican state in Nepal, are believed to have accumulated large amounts of money from donations both from home and abroad to finance their activities.
They have also been accused of extorting money from the business community in the past six years.
The government has said the rebels looted a large amount of money from commercial banks during raids on government positions across the country last November after the rebels walked out of peace talks with the government.
For its part, the government at the end of November declared a state of emergency in the country and deployed troops in a search and destroy operation against the rebels.

"230",20021277,"Title: Maoist insurgency hits tourist arrivals, slows Nepal 's economy.rtf; Date: April 27, 2002 Saturday; Text: KATMANDU, Nepal - A decline in tourist arrivals and increased security spending has slowed Nepal's economy as Maoist rebels have stepped up their fight for a communist republic in this Himalayan kingdom, officials said Saturday.
Economic growth, which averaged 5 percent annually during the last decade, will decline to 2 percent in the fiscal year ending mid-July, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told The Associated Press.
The rebels' call for a five-day national strike, that was to end Saturday, has caused losses of around rupees 5 billion (dlrs 62.5 million) as businesses shut down and tourists canceled bookings. The six-year insurgency, to abolish constitutional monarchy, has killed more than 3,000 people.
""It is undoing the economic gains of a democratic system,"" Mahat said.
However, Mahat said that Nepal's ""economic fundamentals are still sound with low inflation and a moderate budget deficit.""
He added the government was in talks with several countries for more funds to fight the insurgency. The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that Washington plans dlrs 20 million in military aid for Nepal.
Security spending of the Nepalese government, which has a 100-billion-rupee (dlrs 1.25 billion) annual budget, has shot up since King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency in November to mobilize the army against the rebels.
The government doubled its spending on security, devoting 15 percent of this year's budget on the army and the armed police force that was created after Nepal's ill-equipped regular police failed in the face of rising Maoist violence.
The increased spending has come at the expense of development work. Power and road projects have been put on hold for lack of funds. The rebels have destroyed bridges, power stations, radio and telephone towers worth billions of rupees (millions of dollars).
Since Nepal changed from an absolute monarchy to a multiparty democracy in 1990, the country has made steady progress with generous donations from international aid agencies. A favorable trade treaty with India, Nepal's giant neighbor, saw exports growing at more than 20 percent annually in the second half of the 1990s.
But for the first time in more than a decade, exports are expected to decline this year, said Mahat.
The biggest blow, however, comes from a 20 percent decline in tourist arrivals in Nepal - which offers some of the world's best mountain trekking.
A plane hijack, the massacre of the royal family and renewed Maoist violence since the state of emergency was declared has deterred tourists from both the West and from the mainstay of the tourism industry - India.
""We've had a bad time since 1999,"" said Pradeep Raj Pandey, chief executive of Nepal Tourism Board.
The hijack of an Indian Airlines plane in 1999 spooked Indian tourists. Pandey said that Indians comprised just 20 percent of the 300,000 arrivals in 2001. Two years ago, their share was about 35 percent.
Western tourists have been discouraged by the massacre of the Nepalese royal family in June and the rise in Maoist violence in recent months.

A police official in northern Jumla district, where thousands of Maoists marched on the headquarters Khalanga early Friday, said the bodies of 88 Maoists have been recovered after a fierce battle in which the army regained control several hours later.
""Thirty-three policemen also died, along with four army soldiers and three civilians,"" the police official told AFP by telephone from Jumla, some 410 kilometers (250 miles) from the capital Kathmandu.
The toll in the remote district was impossible to confirm independently. The Maoists have claimed responsibility for the attack but have not provided their own casualty tolls.
Officials had previously put the death toll from the offensive at just over 150.
The Maoists simultaneously Friday bombed and opened machine-gun fire on a security post in the western Gurkha district, killing 23 policemen, according to Nepal's police chief Pradeep Shumsher Rana.
Rana, speaking on state television Saturday, said about 50 rebels were also killed in the Gurkha assault.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and establish a communist state. Their ""people's war"" has claimed more than 7,200 lives, according to security forces' figures.
Officials said Saturday that another 28 people were killed in scattered clashes in the wake of the Maoist offensive.
On Sunday, the Nepali-language newspaper Kantipur said at least four soldiers were killed and several others injured in a mine planted by the Maoists in the northern Nuwakot district.
In the capital Kathmandu, police said suspected Maoists torched six cars and seven motorcycles parked outside the offices of Nepal's state-run electricity authority and bombed a bus outside a private school. No one was injured in those attacks.
Separately, People's Service Nepal, a local relief organization, said one of its employees, Rajindra Shimkhada, was kidnapped Saturday in Kathmandu by suspected Maoists who approached him after he left the office.
The group said it was unsure why the rebels targeted the man, whose whereabouts were unknown.
Gore Bahadur Khapangi, the minister for women, children and social welfare, said the government and Maoists have agreed to talks, which could take place within a month.
The Maoists, however, said in a statement that they would not sit down to talks unless the government first agrees to their demands, including the convening of a special assembly to rewrite the constitution.

The government refused to comment Thursday.
Paris-based media rights group Reporters Without Borders said Krishna Sen, editor of the weekly Janadisha, ""died under torture last week in a detention center of the Nepalese security forces.""
""His body was handed over to his family for cremation, but the authorities did not supply any information on the reasons for the death,"" the group's general secretary Robert Menard said in a letter to Nepal's prime minister.
Home Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey refused to comment, as have the security forces.
Sen was arrested last month after writing in support of the rebels who are fighting to topple the government. More than 4,000 people have died in the conflict since 1996.
Menard said security forces tortured Sen in an attempt to get him to reveal his rebel contacts.
Local media groups said they had been unable to reach Sen's relatives, who have been in hiding since the government declared emergency rule in November in response to the rebellion.
""We have heard that he died while still in custody, but we have not been able to confirm that and the government officials are avoiding us,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri, general secretary of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists.
The government shut down Janadisha newspaper, financed by the rebels, and arrested most of the journalists working there in after emergency rule was declared.
Under emergency law, Nepal's liberal constitutional freedoms of press, speech and opinion are suspended.
Nearly 100 Nepalese journalists have been detained without charge or arrested under the law. Thirty are still in custody.
Police say journalists have been arrested on suspicion of helping the rebels by publishing false stories intended to weaken security agencies.
Sen was detained for two years after publishing an interview with a rebel leader and was released in March 2001 on orders from the Supreme Court. He was detained again, under the emergency law, on May 20.

Powell, concluding a three-day mission to urge the nuclear-armed rivals to end their monthlong standoff, said leaders of both countries had assured him that dialogue was possible if certain steps were taken.
""I leave here very encouraged that we can find a solution to this troubling situation,"" Powell said after meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and other officials.
""I think we are on a path that could lead to the restoration of dialogue,"" he said. ""But it will take further action before we can really start walking down that path more aggressively.""
Pakistan's President Gen. Pervez Musharraf said for the first time in the standoff that he thought war could be avoided, but warned Pakistan would respond strongly to any attack.
""I am confident that … there won't be a war. We don't want war,"" Musharraf told clerics in Islamabad on Friday. ""But if war is imposed on us, we are ready to … fight with all our might.""
Powell met with Musharraf in Islamabad on Wednesday before arriving in the Indian capital on Thursday. He flew to neighboring Nepal on Friday.
A senior U.S. official traveling with Powell said the secretary of state achieved his goal of winning commitments from India and Pakistan to solve their conflict diplomatically.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Vajpayee agreed to give Pakistan more time to take additional steps against Islamic militants and that Powell was able to get more Indian recognition for the steps Musharraf had already taken.
India and Pakistan have massed hundreds of thousands of troops on their border since a Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups and Pakistan's spy agency. Pakistan has denied involvement.
Powell said India had delivered more evidence to Pakistan about 20 men believed to be living in Pakistan who are accused of terrorist acts in India. India wants them handed over for prosecution.
The names on the list include Dawood Ibrahim, chief suspect in a 1993 blast at the Stock Exchange and Air India building in Bombay; Masood Azhar, a terrorist suspect freed from Indian prison in exchange for the release of hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane hijacked in 1999; and those allegedly involved in attacks in Indian border states.
Musharraf has said he will never hand over Pakistanis, but left open the possibility that some of the 14 Indians on the list could be extradited.
""He doesn't rule out appropriate action against those non-Pakistanis who are on that list of 20,"" Powell said, adding that ""more information was given to them and to us.""
""We hope that President Musharraf will examine all the information and do what is the appropriate thing to do in the case of each one of those 20,"" Powell said.
The secretary of state lauded Musharraf for a speech last weekend condemning terrorism and vowing to curb Islamic militants who launch attacks against India.
Musharraf said he would not allow militants to conduct terrorist acts in the name of Kashmir. However, he said his country would continue to support their claim of independence for India's only Muslim state, or a merger with Pakistan.
In his speech, Musharraf announced a ban on five groups, including Islamic and Kashmiri militants. Nearly 2,000 suspected militants have been arrested in a nationwide crackdown.
Singh, at a news conference Friday with Powell, said India welcomed Musharraf's remarks but was waiting for more action on the ground before it will consider pulling troops back from the border.
""There has already been some action, which India has welcomed,"" Singh said. ""And if there is action in regards to the 20 wanted terrorists and criminals, then I am very hopeful that we would seek movement toward a situation similar to what it was before the 13th.""
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over the Himalayan province of Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of funding and arming Islamic militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir, where a 12-year insurgency has killed more than 32,000 people.
A so-called ""Line of Control"" divides Kashmir between the two countries.
After the suicide attack on India's Parliament, in which 14 people were killed including five attackers, cross-border shelling escalated and dozens of civilians have been killed. Tens of thousands of villagers have been displaced on both sides.

Kishor Shrestha, editor of Janaastha weekly, and Bishnu Ghimire, editor of the Janaprahar daily, were picked up from their offices on Sunday, said Ram Chandra Khanal, a police officer.
Shrestha was arrested on charges he slandered a criminal investigator with published accusations of bribery. Ghimire was arrested for allegedly demanding rupees 10,000 (dlrs 128) from a restaurant owner whom the editor accused of supplying prostitutes.
Police have been given sweeping powers to arrest or detain anyone without warrants for 24 days since the government declared a state of emergency in November to fight a Maoist insurgency. Civil rights, including press freedoms, have also been suspended.
Neither of the editors could be reached for comment.
Their arrests drew fire from media groups in Nepal, where more than 20 journalists are still in custody.
""We have strongly condemned the arrests. The government is only trying to scare journalists,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists. ""These journalists were arrested without any basis and because they have been writing against police and the government's curtailing of the press freedom in the country.""

The editor, Krishna Sen of the weekly Janadisha newspaper, was arrested in May after the government accused him of writing articles in support of the rebels, who are fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
The government has not confirmed Sen's death but said that police were investigating.
Last month, the Paris-based media rights group Reporters Without Borders said that Sen had ""died under torture … in a detention center of the Nepalese security forces.""

The guerrillas, who are fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy, set off two bombs in residential areas of Kathmandu, where nearly all businesses and schools were closed by the general strike, police said.
The blasts did not cause any injuries. Police said they had arrested three people in Kathmandu during the strike, including one caught with explosives near a government revenue office.
In the eastern Sindhupalchok district, a group of Maoists bombed a prison on Monday afternoon in a bid to release detained rebels, killing a police sergeant, private radio said in Kathmandu.
Overnight, the rebels kidnapped and beheaded the leader of Nepal's main opposition party in the eastern Kabhre district, the party said.
The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) said Krishna Prasad Sapkota was dragged out of his house as he slept and that his head was found on the bank of a river Monday morning.
""We strongly denounce such barbarism, which must be stopped,"" said the party, which has in the past called on the government to hold peace talks with the rebels.
Kathmandu's normally bustling streets were quiet Monday, with all vehicles, except for a few bicycles and motorbikes, off the streets. Several government cars were also seen defying the strike.
Reports from outside the capital said the strike was similarly observed in much of the kingdom. Security was stepped up around key government installations.
Bombs have gone off or been defused daily in Kathmandu since August 28, when a state of emergency was lifted. The emergency, which was imposed after the Maoists broke a ceasefire in November, had given authorities more leeway to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.
Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known by his alias ""Prachanda"", or ""The Fierce"", on Thursday proposed dialogue with the government to find a ""positive and peaceful"" way to end the insurgency, which has claimed more than 4,700 lives since 1996.
The government rejected the offer as insincere, calling on the Maoists to show their goodwill through action, such as by giving up their demands for an assembly to redraft the constitution.
A meeting Sunday of 10 parties, including the NCP-UML, called by Deuba's arch-rival and predecessor as premier, Girija Prasad Koirala, said the government should give up its demand that the Maoists lay down their arms before talks.
Nepal is scheduled to hold parliamentary polls November 13, two years ahead of schedule. Deuba and Koirala, both members of the Nepali Congress party, are expected to run against each other.
Deuba vowed to crush the Maoists after they broke the four-month truce he had reached with them, saying he felt personally betrayed.
Earlier this year, however, he indicated he would be willing to meet with Maoist military leaders on ending the violence. Sources close to the premier said Deuba has come under pressure from major foreign donors, which have supported his crackdown, to work harder to resolve the dispute.

The government proposal to extend emergency rule was backed by 194 members of the 205-seat lower house of parliament, far more than the required two-thirds majority.
The vote followed weekend attacks by the Maoists -- the bloodiest since the insurgency began in February 1996 -- which killed more than 150 people, mostly soldiers and police.
The violence continued Wednesday with 51 rebels killed in clashes with security personnel in western and southwestern Nepal, state-run radio said.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba had proposed the extension saying it was required to completely crush the rebellion, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in the past six years.
He managed to secure the votes of most opposition MPs, who were initially critical of the emergency saying it had denied people basic rights and suppressed press freedom.
A visibly relieved Deuba thanked the leaders of the opposition following the vote, which took place after two days of fierce debate.
In the end, 110 of the 113 MPs belonging to Deuba's ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party voted for the motion. Two government ministers were not present as they were on visits out of Kathmandu, while the speaker did not vote.
The 69 MPs of the main opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) voted for the motion as did the 11 rightist National Democratic Party MPs and four MPs from the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Seven MPs from smaller opposition parties voted against, while one was absent.
The emergency, which was first introduced on November 26 after the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire with the government and backed out of peace talks, will now run until May 25.
Before the vote Deuba told parliament: ""This emergency is needed to control the Maoists, who are killing innocent people.""
He paid tribute to army and police personnel who ""had sacrificed their lives for the nation.""
The NCP-UML had told Deuba they would support him in return for constitutional reforms, new socio-economic programmes as well as some liberalisation of the emergency rules.
During the debate, NCP-UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said: ""The Nepalese people are suffering from emergency and due to it people's rights and press freedoms have been thwarted.""
""The constitutional rights of political parties have been curbed while even peaceful demonstrations have been curtailed,"" he said.
""We want the prime minister to give us a satisfactory answer to all our grievances, before he seeks our support,"" Nepal added.
In response, Deuba said he agreed to work out some social and economic reforms in accordance with the suggestions by the opposition.
""I want to assure the house… I am prepared for constitutional reforms,"" he said.
""I want to thank all the opposition party MPs who have expressed their opinion and suggestions for a good governance and control of corruption apart from protecting the human rights and press freedom.""
""As for the question of the civic rights, good governance and press freedom, the government wants the life of the general public not to be affected,"" he added.
He appealed for unity from the political parties in order to combat the insurgency.
""In view of the law and order problem created by the Maoist terrorists, I want to appeal to all the political party leaders to work jointly with the government for the welfare of the people.""
Security in Nepal, particularly in Kathmandu, was stepped up in advance of a two-day general strike called by the Maoists which is set to begin Friday.

"241",20021660,"Title: Nepal 's PM to discuss reimposing emergency.rtf; Date: September 3, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said Tuesday he wanted to discuss whether to reimpose a state of emergency -- which was lifted last week for the first time in 10 months -- following a series of bomb attacks by suspected Maoist rebels.
The emergency was first introduced in November last year to combat the increasingly violent guerrillas and extended twice, despite protests from opposition parties and rights groups that it was draconian.
But last week Deuba, during a visit to Belgium, said the emergency would be allowed to lapse because parliamentary elections are due to be held on November 13. It expired on August 28.
Deuba returned from his trip to Belgium, Britain and Thailand on Tuesday and spoke to journalists at the airport.
""I cannot say anything right now. I will have to discuss the matter with concerned persons before any decisions can be made,"" he said in response to questions on the emergency.
""Even if there is an emergency, it will be lifted during the elections,"" he added.
""As soon as the candidates submit their candidacy for the elections, the emergency would cease to exist,"" he said.
On Sunday minister without portfolio Rishikesh Gautam said the emergency could be reimposed if the law and order situation continued to deteriorate.
The Maoists have stepped up their attacks in and around Kathmandu in the past week with bombs going off or being defused virtually every day.
On Tuesday the army defused two bombs in the capital, while late Monday two went off on the outskirts of the city causing damage to buildings.
The emergency gave local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected rebels and impose curfews.
Critics said it curtailed human rights and had not been effective in the fight against the guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1996 for a communist republic.
After Deuba came to power last year he initiated a ceasefire with the rebels, but it floundered after three rounds of peace talks stalled.
More than 4,300 people have died in the insurgency, with around two-thirds of the deaths coming since November last year when the rebels broke the ceasefire.
Deuba said he had cancelled a trip to Johannesburg to attend the Earth Summit because of the recent attacks.
""I had to cancel the trip to South Africa due to the current situation in Nepal. I heard about the disturbances here,"" he said.
Asked if the government would hold peace talks with the Maoists before the elections, he said: ""I don't know but they once ran away from the talks.""
Meanwhile local radio said the rebels shot and killed four farmers on Monday night in Ramechhap, 85 kilometres (53 miles) east of here.
State-run radio said the house of former minister Rajendra Kharel in the eastern district of Kavrepalanchok was set on fire by the guerrillas. It was not known whether Kharel was there at the time, but no one was injured.

"242",20021446,"Title: Meeting and visits, but no 'talks' for India and Pakistan.rtf; Date: January 8, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Military tensions between India and Pakistan have shown no sign of easing despite meetings of sorts between the leaders of the nuclear rivals and a tentative peace mission by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
For all the talk on both sides of not wanting a war, their armies remain locked in a tense border stand-off, which has witnessed numerous and heavy exchanges of fire -- any of which carries the potential to trigger an escalated conflict.
On the diplomatic front, there have been signs of a slight relaxation compared with the bellicose rhetoric flung around in the immediate wake of the December 13 attack on the Indian parliament which triggered the current crisis.
India blamed the attack on Pakistan-based militants and demanded that Islamabad crack down on Islamic militant groups -- handing over a list of 20 ""criminals"" it wants arrested and extradited.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf met informally at last weekend's South Asian regional summit in Kathmandu.
While both sides differed in defining the nature and substance of their interacation, the fact that it happened at all was seen as a positive development -- albeit one that offered no discernible way out of the current impasse.
""There has been no decline in military dispositions on either side and the risk of a clash developing remains prominent,"" said Pran Chopra, political analyst at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.
""But there has been a decline in the mood of tension and anxiety,"" Chopra said, citing perceptions in India that its anger over the parliament attack had registered with the international community.
In the week following December 13, hawkish elements within Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist-led government had called for swift military retaliation in the form of strikes against alleged militant training camps in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
Those voices have fallen silent since, amid intense international pressure on Pakistan to take action against militant groups and on India to show restraint and move towards a political dialogue.
""I don't believe the situation is defused yet. But I do believe there is a way to do so,"" US President George W. Bush said Monday.
However the path towards a mutually agreed de-escalation is a tortuous one for two countries mired in a legacy of more than half-a-century of mutual mistrust and antagonism that has led to three full-scale wars.
Pakistan wants India to reduce troop numbers on the border and engage in a dialogue. India insists there can be no talks unless Pakistan does more to combat ""cross-border terrorism.""
During his visit to both countries in the past few days, Prime Minister Blair offered a two-pronged formula, involving the total rejection of terrorism and the resumption of political dialogue.
Mindful of the complexities and sensitivities involved, Blair stuck to statements of general principle rather than confronting the nitty-gritty of Indo-Pakistan relations.
Khalid Mehmood, an analyst at the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad said Blair's visit had partially succeeded in defusing tensions, even if it failed to bring the two sides to the negotiating table.
""There is a status quo at the moment and I personally believe India and Pakistan will not go to war,"" Mehmood said.
""And with the passage of time, India will find some way to wriggle out of the present confrontation and accept the offer of dialogue.""
Following talks with Blair on Monday, President Musharraf announced he would shortly unveil a plan to eradicate militancy in the country.
""We are taking steps within Pakistan to bring some degree of normalcy, balance, introducing a tolerant society (and) checking any form of militancy within our society,"" he said.
But India, in the short-term at least, is unlikely to ease off the pressure on Musharraf, feeling that the momentum generated by crisis is running its way and that the diplomatic is heat is being felt more in Islamabad than New Delhi.
Meanwhile, tensions on the border continue to simmer.
""Any hope from the summit (in Nepal) has been belied,"" Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes said Monday.
""There is no qualitative change in the border situation.""

The bomb exploded outside a car battery shop in the Teku neighborhood of Katmandu, wounding six passers by, one critically, a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
The officer blamed Maoist rebels for the explosion.
The rebels, who have been fighting to abolish Nepal's monarchy, have increased attacks since King Gyanendra lifted a state of emergency in August to allow for election campaigning.
The emergency was imposed last November to mobilize the Royal Nepalese Army to help the country's ill-equipped police in fighting the rebels. The six-year insurgency, which the rebels claim is inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, has left more than 5,000 people dead.
Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry issued a statement saying security forces had killed at least 21 rebels in separate clashes across the Himalayan kingdom.

"244",20021515,"Title: Nepal PM, fighting Maoists, faces rebellion inside party.rtf; Date: January 31, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nearly half of Nepal's ruling party MPs have joined a campaign to oust Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba over his government's proposals to counter corruption and to extend emergency rule that was imposed to isolate Maoist rebels.
At least 50 of the Nepali Congress' 113 MPs have signed on to the campaign against Deuba, highly placed party sources said. The dissidents need the support of 57 MPs to remove the prime minister.
Deuba's opponents are rallying behind party president Girija Prasad Koirala, who resigned as premier in July and was replaced by Deuba after criticism that he had failed to take sufficient action against a growing Maoist rebellion.
Deuba's new government immediately reached a truce with the leftists and began peace talks. But three rounds of negotiations yielded no breakthrough and the Maoists broke the ceasefire in late November.
In response the government deployed the army for the first time and, controversially, imposed a three-month state of emergency in the kingdom. Deuba has said the emergency is needed for at least another three months to bring the Maoists to their knees.
Asked about the campaign to bring a no-confidence vote against him, Deuba told AFP: ""I don't know. I have no knowledge of it.""
European diplomats here said Deuba's removal would seriously worsen the security situation in Nepal, where the key industry, tourism, was hit hard in 2001 because of the Maoist rebellion and a massacre of the royal family.
The diplomats said the unrest was showing signs of subsiding after the imposition of the emergency and the deployment of security forces to 72 of the kingdom's 75 districts.
More than 2,300 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy.
Impoverished Nepal has seen chronic instability since the constitutional monarchy was instituted 11 years ago, with prime ministers changing an average of once a year.
The controversial extension of emergency rule would require a two-thirds majority in the 205-member parliament, where the Nepali Congress holds 113 seats.
But the chief opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), which has 68 MPs, has been critical of emergency rule, which it and the ruling party dissidents say has imposed undue burden on ordinary Nepalese.
""The emergency should not control the press and the people's political and fundamental rights,"" NCP-UML MP Iswor Pokharel said.
The opposition party also wants Deuba to reform the election system to give fewer oversight powers to police and district officials.
The ruling party dissidents have also denounced Deuba for not curbing rampant corruption.
But sources said some are also upset at a bill Deuba is pushing in parliament that would set up a high-powered commission that could investigate and punish any official, including the prime minister, who is accused of abusing his or her power.
Narahari Acharya, a member of the Nepali Congress' central committee, stressed that moves to sack Deuba would find less enthusiasm among district-level party workers if the issue is taken out of the capital.
Former prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, a Nepali Congress lawmaker, blasted the attempts to remove Deuba, saying six months was not enough time to pass judgment on a government.
""Deuba is doing his utmost to solve the country's problems of terrorism and corruption. Let him run the government for a complete one year before any attempt is made to remove,"" he said.

"245",2002732,"Title: Blair peace shuttle moves from India to Pakistan.rtf; Date: January 7, 2002 Monday; Text: British Prime Minister Tony Blair left India for Pakistan on Monday on the next stage of a US-backed diplomatic mission to cool military tensions between the South Asian nuclear rivals and nudge them towards a dialogue.
The current crisis between India and Pakistan, which has left their massed armies in a perilous border stand-off, has transformed Blair's South Asia tour into a tricky peacekeeping exercise in a perennially volatile region.
Thoughout his four-day visit to India, Blair pushed a two-stage process for defusing tensions, involving a complete rejection of terrorism, followed by a political dialogue.
The carefully crafted formula catered to India's demands that Pakistan crack down on ""anti-Indian"" militant groups operating from its territory and to Islamabad's call for a resumption of formal bilateral talks.
The British prime minister held talks Sunday with his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee and was scheduled to meet later Monday with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad.
""It is important to reach a position where support for terrorism in whatever form stops, so that political dialogue can begin,"" Blair said after his meeting with Vajpayee, during which the two leaders signed a joint declaration condemning all those who support and finance terrorist activities.
Aware of the complex sensitivities and rivalries in the region, Blair has limited his public statements to expressions of general principle, stressing that it is for India and Pakistan to decide how to move forward.
""The prime minister is not going to get into the details … What is important is that we establish the broad principles,"" Blair's official spokesman told reporters before he left New Delhi in a Hercules C-130 transport plane.
The spokesman said Blair held a 15-minute telephone conversation with US President George W. Bush on Monday morning, underlining Washington's close involvement in his peacekeeping efforts.
""The Americans are on the same line,"" the spokesman said.
Top US officials are expected to decide this week whether to send a special envoy to South Asia in the hope of heading off more turmoil which Washington fears could seriously hamper its war on terrorism in the region.
Pakistan has welcomed the prospect of a US envoy but India, which has always been wary of third-party mediation in its disputes with Islamabad, has so far given the idea the cold shoulder.
The crisis in India-Pakistan relations was triggered by last month's attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi, which left 14 people dead.
Indian has blamed the attack on two Pakistan-based militant groups and demanded that Islamabad crack down on all militant outfits it identifies as participating in ""cross-border terrorism.""
Asked if Blair was taking any special message for Musharraf, the prime minister's spokesman said he would reiterate the two-stage formula.
""One, that there can be no halfway house on not supporting terrorism. Two, that there is a need for dialogue.""
The crux of the terrorism issue in the region is India and Pakistan's dispute over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which has already triggered two full-scale wars.
India says the 12-year-old Muslim separatist insurgcency in Indian-controlled Kashmir is being fought by ""terrorist"" groups sponsored by Pakistan. Islamabad views the separatist movement as a freedom struggle for Kashmiri self-determination.
""We need to distinguish between acts of legitimate resistance and terrorism,"" Musharraf told a summit of South Asian leaders in Nepal at the weekend.

The monarch, who fired the prime minister and disbanded the Cabinet last week, was not expected to return to Katmandu until Thursday afternoon from Gorkha, about 75 miles west of the capital, palace officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the trip was a scheduled visit for a Hindu festival.
Royal aides had earlier said a new government would be in place by Saturday to replace the one fired by Gyanendra on Friday. Leaders of the six main parties have been waiting since Monday night to meet the king.
The king fired Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister, saying he was incompetent, after Deuba asked the monarch to postpone elections by a year because of the threat of disruption by communist rebels. The king, however, postponed the elections indefinitely.
""It is unfortunate that the king has ignored the plea of the major political parties for a meeting,"" said Khadga Prasad Oli of the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, the country's second largest party.
""We are all anxiously waiting for what the king would decide before we do anything,"" he said.
Nepal is now marking Dasain, the Hindu-dominated country's biggest festival, during which many Nepalese visit ancestral homes and temples.
The king had set a five-day deadline - now passed - for political parties to propose a leader for an interim government that would later conduct elections. In the meantime, the king has executive power.
Deuba has called his sacking unconstitutional, but Nepal's constitution has no provision for challenging the king's decision in court.
Gyanendra ascended to the throne last year after his brother, Birendra, and eight other members of the royal family were allegedly gunned down by the crown prince, who then took his own life. Since the massacre, the rebels have intensified their campaign to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
More than 5,000 people have been killed since the insurgency began in 1996.

""Japan strongly condemns the indiscriminate terrorist attacks against ordinary citizens and social infrastructure,"" said a statement from the Japanese embassy in Katmandu, the Nepalese capital.
""Japan supports the efforts by the government of Nepal toward restoration of order within the framework of the constitution,"" the statement said.
Japan, which is Nepal's biggest foreign donor, did not say if it was giving any financial help to Nepal fight the rebels. Nepal has been pleading for help since the rebels resumed attacks on government forces, prompting King Gyanendra to impose emergency rule, which allows the army to join police in fighting the insurgency.
Other nations, including the United States and Britain, have already pledged to help and said they would consider financial aid.
Emergency rule was first imposed in November after the rebels broke a cease-fire, saying peace talks were going nowhere, and the king has extended it twice. Persistent fighting has claimed hundreds of lives since then.
The Defense Ministry said late Wednesday that at least 12 Maoists guerrillas were gunned down by the military during fighting overnight Tuesday.
Eight rebels were killed in Rayal village in Bajhan district, 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of Katmandu while another four were killed in Solukhumbu, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Katmandu.

The rebels of the outlawed Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), waging a six-year armed insurgency in the country, had walked out of peace talks with the government and resumed armed attacks at police and army positions last November.
The government had responded by declaring a state of emergency in the country and ordering the army to fight the rebels who want to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist state in Nepal.
Till then, Nepal's ill-equipped police had fought the rebels, who launched their violent campaign in Nepal in 1996.
In a statement sent to media organizations Thursday, the Maoists said the Nepalese people and political parties have recently stressed the need to end the present political impasse and to avoid foreign intervention.
'We welcome the move and are ready to take any steps toward that direction,' said the statement, which did not mention any conditions for the resumption of the peace talks.
During their failed peace talks with the government last year, the rebels had demanded a constituent assembly draw up a new Constitution for the Himalayan kingdom.
In Thursday's statement, the rebels called on the government not to take their move for peace talks as a sign of weakness.
'Our responsibilities to the country and the people have pressed us to hurry for the peace talks,' the statement said.
The rebels proposal for the new round of talks comes amid government calls for the rebels to first lay down their arms.
While the army is hunting down rebels across the country, those in political circles have raised concerns over what they call 'scaling activities of foreign militaries in the country.'
Politicians of both the ruling as well as opposition parties have taken exception to the recent visit of U.S. military officials in the insurgency-affected areas in mid-western parts of Nepal a few weeks ago.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba will visit the United States next week and Nepalese official media are playing up his planned meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush.
The army has killed some 3,000 communist insurgents after imposition of the state of emergency last November, Nepalese newspapers have reported.
Information and Communications Minister Jayaprakash Gupta said the army has 'broken the lifeline of the terrorists.'
In a statement issued Thursday, the Defense Ministry said the army shot and killed 22 rebels in seven different districts in the past 24 hours.
Eight rebels were killed in Rukum district in mid-western Nepal, it said.

The meeting was held at the headquarters of the main opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) in Kathmandu.
""It was the first-time meeting of the opposition leaders of different ideologies, sponsored by the NCP-UML to discuss the grave situations faced by the country ..,"" a NCP-UML statement said.
In November the government, led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, declared a state of emergency and deployed the army against the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy.
At the meeting, leaders of the parties, which included other leftwing parties as well as the rightist National Democratic Party, discussed the security situation, the curbing of press freedoms under the emergency and the arrests of several journalists.
The government has warned the media not to write anything which could ""encourage"" the Maoists and a number of journalists have been detained since November, though most have been released.
The government is also thinking of extending the emergency beyond three months, but it needs the support of parliament to do so.
The leaders said they were concerned about escalating corruption, state expenditure and the negative impact of the state of emergency
""The participants of the meeting decided to hand over a notice to the government to draw its attention to properly deal with these problems and press it to shorten the period of the emergency,"" the statement said.

""I don't think war is a necessity. I will put in all efforts to avoid it,"" Vajpayee told reporters in the northern city of Lucknow.
""If diplomatic methods can be applied to resolve the existing problems, I don't see why we should resort to other means,"" Vajpayee said, while also ruling out any nuclear strike by India amid an intense military build-up on both sides of the border with Pakistan.
""When I said we have a right to defend ourselves, I never meant nuclear weapons. Our nuclear policies are very clear. We have said no first use.""
But Vajpayee also said there could be no bilateral talks with Pakistan until it brings ""cross-border terrorism"" to a complete halt.
He also made it clear that recent steps taken by Islamabad to crack down on Islamic militant groups blamed for last month's attack on the Indian parliament had not gone far enough.
""We shall be open to a dialogue only when cross-border terrorism is stopped,"" Vajpayee said, effectively scuppering any hopes of formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of ongoing South Asian regional talks in Nepal.
Vajpayee cited Wednesday's grenade attack by suspected Muslim militants outside the state legislature in Indian Kashmir as evidence that Pakistan ""has no intention to give up on terrorism.""
India and Pakistan have massed tens of thousands of troops on their border in the wake of the December 13 attack on the parliament in New Delhi, which India says was carried out by Pakistan-based militants and sponsored by Pakistani military intelligence.
Tensions have eased slightly in recent days as Pakistan has announced the arrest of more than 100 Islamic extremists.
But Vajpayee said details of the Pakistani crackdown were too sketchy and it was still unclear how many of those arrested were linked to the parliament attack and other ""terrorist"" activities in India.

"258",20021289,"Title: Kashmiri independence leader appeals to India , Pakistan.rtf; Date: January 4, 2002 Friday; Text: Kashmiri pro-independence leader Yasin Malik called on India and Pakistan Friday to show ""courage, vision and restraint"" to avoid a war and resolve the Kashmir issue, which he described as the main obstacle to peace in South Asia.
Malik, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), also denounced the ""war euphoria"" which has seen the nuclear-capable South Asian rivals massing troops on their borders.
Malik's appeal for peace came as Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf were set to meet Friday with other South Asian leaders at a regional summit in Nepal.
""We hope Vajpayee and Musharraf will show courage, vision and restraint so that there is no war,"" Malik told AFP.
""Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris must get engaged in a genuine dialogue to solve the Kashmir issue which is the only stumbling block for peace in South Asia.""
India has ruled out any one-to-one dialogue between Vajpayee and Musharraf during the summit, arguing that Pakistan must take further steps to crack down on Islamic militant groups before any formal bilateral dialogue can begin.
Military tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in the wake of the December 13 attack on India's parliament building in New Delhi.
New Delhi blamed the attack on two Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups which are battling Indian rule in Kashmir and demanded that Islamabad shut them down, arrest their leaders and freeze their assets.
Malik welcomed the measures taken by Pakistan so far against extremist groups, but stressed that cracking down on Pakistan-based militants would not affect the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination.
""Whatever Pakistan does, the Kashmiri movement is and will remain an indigenous movement. It will not affect it in any way.""
An armed insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir -- the country's only Muslim-majority state -- has claimed at least 35,000 lives since 1989.
Pakistan demands that India seek a political resolution to the separatist conflict, while New Delhi insists that the real problem lies in Islamabad's support of Islamic militants waging a ""proxy war.""
But Malik argued that India had to see beyond the ""terrorist"" tag when dealing with Kashmir.
""India knows that until they resolve the Kashmir issue they cannot bring peace. They must be reasonable and have a pragmatic approach.""
Malik also said that if there were some ""positive developments"" in the near future, then Kashmir's main separatist alliance, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, would appeal to armed militant groups to implement a ceasefire.
However, he did not specify the nature of the developments that Hurriyat was looking for.
Malik condemned last month's attack on the Indian parliament and said those responsible should be prosecuted.
""There must be cooperation to identify those elements,"" he added.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is divided between the two rivals.
India is expected to use the South Asian summit in Nepal to push its accusations that Pakistan is sponsoring ""cross-border terrorism"" in Indian-controlled Kashmir by arming and training militant groups in the region.
Islamabad denies the charge, but extends open moral and diplomatic support to what it describes as the Kashmiris' just struggle for self-determination.

The policemen were attacked while on patrol near the village of Barpak in the Gorkha district, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Katmandu, Chief District Officer Bhola Prasad Siwakoti said.
The guerrillas set fire to the local police station and looted arms and ammunition before fleeing, he said.
The rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and impose communist rule, generally do not comment on the ongoing clashes with the army and police. The insurgency has killed more than 3,000 people, including guerrillas.
The rebels are based in remote mountainous areas and draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung.
Nepal's King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency on Nov. 26, and ordered the army to clamp down on the rebels after they withdrew from peace talks and attacked government troops and offices.

"260",20021806,"Title: Political crisis worsens in Nepal as new elections are announced.rtf; Date: May 23, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nepal's ruling party suspended the prime minister from its ranks Thursday to protest his decision to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections while the army engages in a fierce campaign against Maoist insurgents.
Three ministers also quit the Cabinet in protest against Prime Minister Sher Bahudur Deuba's action.
Deuba moved to dissolve the parliament after a faction of lawmakers in his ruling Nepali Congress party opposed his plan to extend the country's six-month-old state of emergency to help deal with the insurgency.
The emergency was imposed by the constitutional monarch, King Gyandendra, on Nov. 26 after Maoists withdrew from stalled peace talks and resumed fighting. The decree, which suppressed press freedom and allowed the government to detain without charge anyone suspected of supporting the rebels, needed parliament's two-thirds vote for an extension.
Deuba sought and successfully received the king's order to dissolve the parliament and call new elections for Nov. 13, a decision announced by the palace close to midnight Wednesday.
Such political feuds in Nepal are not new, but this one has come at a difficult time for this Himalayan country, which is dealing with an insurgency that seeks to topple the government and install communist rule.
Of the more than 3,500 people killed since the rebels began their violent campaign in 1996, more than half have died during the past five months as the army swept rebel hide-outs.
The Defense Ministry said Thursday that at least 19 guerrillas were killed in fighting across the nation on Wednesday night.
Deuba could remain prime minister until the Nov. 13 elections. If the suspension is turned into an expulsion, which is likely, he will not be able to campaign under the flag of the Nepali Congress, which has won most of Nepal's elections since democracy was restored in 1990.
Deuba had been the leader of one faction in the party, while the other is controlled by the party president and his predecessor as prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala.
Since Koirala was ousted from the prime minister's office by Deuba's supporters last July on accusations of corruption and inability to stem the insurgency, his supporters have criticized Deuba.
The party's disciplinary committee ordered Deuba's suspension Thursday and gave him three days to explain his actions, after which he can be expelled, spokesman Arjun Narsingh said.
Deuba is unlikely to approach the party leadership.
A similar clash between the two factions resulted in midterm elections in 1994.
After the dissolving of parliament was announced, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat resigned from the government Thursday, along with Education Minister Amod Prasad Upadhaya and Women and Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Kharel.
""We were not taken into confidence while making the decision to dissolve parliament, which at the moment is inappropriate,"" the finance minister said.
The last time parliament was dissolved, the late King Birendra - subsequently killed by his son, the crown prince, in a palace massacre last year - took days to weigh the decision and consulted Supreme Court judges.
""It is unfortunate that the feuds in the ruling Nepali Congress party have plunged the country into an uncertain and confusing situation,"" said Khadga Prasad Oli, deputy general secretary of the opposition United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.

The shutdown affected more than 350,000 students in the Kathmandu Valley area, they said.
The pro-Maoist All Nepal National Free Students' Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU-R) called the two-day strike to highlight their demand for free education.
B.B. Shah, from the Public and Boarding School Organization Nepal, said: ""We decided to close all the schools for two days for the safety of the students.""
Schools and colleges had feared there could be violence during the stoppage and security personnel could be seen guarding educational institutions in Kathmandu.
But the first day of the strike passed off peacefully, police said.
The ANNFSU-R was banned by the government shortly after it introduced a state of emergency in November to combat a six-year Maoist insurgency which has claimed more than 2,600 lives.
It was outlawed for supporting the Maoist rebels.

Birendra, Queen Aishwarya and seven other royals were killed at the royal palace on June 1 last year by crown prince Dipendra, who then shot himself.
Shrestha had unprecedented access to Birendra and other royals and the 166 photographs show the king in both formal and informal situations -- at home, on holiday in the Himalayas and during state visits to various countries including Tibet, China, India and Britain.
At the opening in Kathmandu, caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba paid tribute to the late king.
""Late king Birendra will always remain in our memories,"" Deuba said.
""During the 20 months as prime minister in the mid 1990s, I always received guidance and advice from the king which helped me to carry out my responsibilities.

""The Asian rhino will only be saved from extinction if we can reduce the pervasive ongoing demand for traditional Asian medicine and restore its shrinking and fragmented habitat,"" said Elizabeth Kemf, co-author of WWFs new status report, Wanted Alive! Asian Rhinos in the Wild.
The WWF report, released on Wednesday, says the three species of Asian rhino -- the greater one-horned rhino, the Javan rhino and the Sumatran rhino -- number around 2,900 in total.
At least 86 have been killed by poachers in the past four years alone, mainly in India and Nepal, of which 15 were killed in a five month spate of poaching in the Himalayan kingdom.
""The animals were shot by firearms, speared, poisoned, electrocuted or trapped in pits. The poachers are mainly in pursuit of rhino horn and other body parts, used in traditional Asian medicine systems to treat a wide range of illnesses,"" the report said.
According to the report, the Javan rhino is on the brink of extinction in Vietnam, where there are probably fewer than eight, and clinging precariously to survival in Indonesia where it numbers no more than 60.
""The roughly 300 Sumatran rhinos that live in Indonesia and Malaysia are under relentless pressure from poaching, and while there are now 2,400 greater one-horned rhinos in India and Nepal, they too are vulnerable,"" the WWF report said.
The Asian rhino faces danger from organized poaching gangs who kill the thick-skinned pachyderm for its horn, which is believed to be an aphrodisiac.
Rhino horn is also used in traditional medicines to cure fever, stomach ailments and other diseases in many parts of South Asia, besides being much fancied by Arab buyers for dagger handles and trinkets.
A kilogram of rhino horn sells for up to 1.5 million rupees (30,000 dollars) in international markets.
But the report says the situation is not all bad and there have been some conservation success stories.
The 430 square kilometre (172 square mile) Kaziranga National Park in Indias northeastern state of Assam is home to the largest concentration of greater one-horned rhinos -- more than 1,500 out of the total world population of 2,400 roam in the sanctuary.
Early in the last century only a dozen greater one-horned rhinos survived in the Kaziranga Park. It has been a protected site since 1908 and the population has grown to more 1,500 today, the WWF report said.
""While there has been some progress in ensuring a future for one-horned rhinos, there is still a lot of work to be done to protect the other two species,"" said Christy Williams, coordinator of WWF's Asian rhino and elephant action strategy programme.
""Unless more money and effort goes into reducing the demand for traditional Asian medicine, anti-poaching and curbing land conversion for oil palm, coffee and paper pulp, we risk losing these prehistoric yet majestic looking creatures forever.""

""The all-party meeting was held for four hours Monday morning where all the political parties discussed the current situation of the country,"" general secretary of Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) Madhav Kumar Nepal told AFP.
The talks came after King Gyanendra, in a surprise move Friday, sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the cabinet and said he was assuming power until he appointed a new prime minister.
Party sources said the king had summoned Deuba to the palace later Monday to discuss the situation.
Nepal said a second round of the all-party talks was scheduled for later Monday because one of the main parties, the pro-India Nepal Sadbhawana, was unable to attend the earlier meeting.
""The second round will again review the situation, the impact of the royal address and action against an elected prime minister and resolve a joint proposal how to move forward to face the current situation,"" he said.
""We will also be discussing the formation of a post-Deuba government,"" Nepal said.
The meeting, held at the residence of Nepali Congress president and former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, was originally due to be held Sunday, but rows over who should attend meant it was postponed.
Deuba's Nepali Congress (Democratic) party was not represented at Monday's meeting, Nepal said, without giving a reason.
On Sunday the heads of five main parties, including Nepal and Koirala, went to the royal palace to hold discussions with the king and told him Friday's decision to sack Deuba and suspend elections scheduled to begin in November was unconstitutional.
""I informed the monarch that the dismissal of an elected prime minister was unconstitutional and undemocratic,"" Nepal said.
""The king said to me that he had been compelled to take this action and has sought cooperation of all the political parties in the interests of the country and the democratic system,"" he added.
He said the party would be staging a rally in Kathmandu on Tuesday to protest against the removal of the elected prime minister.
Gyanendra, a constitutional monarch whose role is meant to be largely ceremonial, said Deuba was ""incompetent"" and not qualified to preside over the elections.
The constitutional crisis began in May when Gyanendra, on Deuba's advice, dissolved the 205-member parliament and called elections for November 13, two years ahead of schedule.
The decision backfired with strong resistance from opposition parties, who said elections could not be held freely and fairly because of a violent Maoist rebellion that has claimed some 5,000 lives in six years.
Deuba then had second thoughts and asked for the election to be delayed until November 19, 2003.
Khum Bahadur Khadka, who was the interior minister in Deuba's sacked cabinet said everyone had been taken by complete surprise by the king's move.
""We did not get any indication from any quarters. It was an unexpected move of the king against the Nepalese constitution and democratic practice.""

""We want a world fit for children, because a world fit for us is a world fit for everyone,"" she said, reading from a statement adopted by a forum of nearly 400 youngsters from around the world earlier this week.
Arrieta and 17-year-old Audrey Cheynut of Monaco joined U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in criticizing grown-ups for creating a world where too many young people face poverty, war and disease.
Cheynut called for greater protection of child refugees, free quality education, free HIV testing, environmental conservation and cancellation of poor countries' debts - whose payment diverts money from children's programs.
The girls' 10-minute appearance was the only opportunity for children to directly address the general assembly during a three-day conference called in their name - and they made it count.
""We are the victims of exploitation and abuse. We are the street children. We are the children of war. We are the victims and orphans of HIV/AIDS. We are denied good quality education and health care,"" said Arrieta, whose face could barely be seen over the podium.
Annan agreed.
""We, the grown-ups, have failed you deplorably,"" he said, noting that 33 percent of youngsters suffer from malnutrition before the age of five, 25 percent are not immunized, nearly 20 percent don't attend school and far too many ""have seen violence that no child should ever see.""
The gathering, which ends Friday, will review the successes and failures in meeting 27 goals set by the 1990 World Summit for Children, and set new priorities and goals for the next 15 years.
More than 50 leaders addressed the plenary session Wednesday, focusing on a wide variety of issues. Representatives of more than 60 countries are scheduled to speak on Thursday, including Peru's President Alejandro Toledo and Mexican President Vicente Fox.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni brought a dozen girls to the podium to underline the importance of girls' education, saying ""this is my delegation."" Egyptian first lady Suzanne Mubarak stressed the need to help Palestinian children. Croatian President Stipe Mesic said the world must eliminate terrorism if it is to improve children's lives. Equatorial Guinea's Prime Minister Candido Rivas warned against giving children liberties ""that go against morals.""
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson underlined President Bush's policy of promoting sexual abstinence for young people.
""Recently, the United States has begun promoting healthy behaviors and right choices for young people. Our efforts include strengthening close parent-child relationships, encouraging the delay of sexual activity, and supporting abstinence education programs,"" he said.
The United States was at odds with other nations over language in the summit's final document on family planning, children's rights, and ""reproductive health,"" which some conservatives interpret as advocating abortion.
""The U.S. position is holding up agreement on the issue of reproductive health,"" said Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund.
A U.S. official said all delegates have agreed privately that ""health services"" doesn't mean abortion, but the United States wants this said in a footnote to the document.
Mike Denis, a State Department legal adviser, told a news conference that the United States has proposed adding abstinence to the final document. He insisted the U.S. position ""strongly reflects the values"" of the American people, and expressed disappointment in the final document for not taking a tougher position against child soldiers, child trafficking and child prostitution and pornography.
Improving access to education, especially for girls, was one of the focuses of the conference's first day.
Arshela Amir Ali, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl, said she was shocked when she heard a Nepalese expression that says that educating a girl is like watering a neighbor's plants.
""It's seen as useless,"" she said. ""But they should think that it is like watering your own garden.""

"271",20022721,"Title: Changes dateline from WASHINGTON Powell seeks 'complete halt' to confrontation between Pakistan , In.rtf; Date: January 15, 2002 Tuesday; Text: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday he hopes his talks this week in Pakistan and India can build on a recent easing of tensions and lead to a ""complete halt"" to the nations' monthlong confrontation.
Speaking to reporters before a refueling stop in Ireland, Powell said a conciliatory speech by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf showed that ""the rush toward conflict has slowed quite a bit.""
In efforts to avoid a war, Powell said, ""There has been an excessive focus on achieving a pullback of the large number of troops that the two sides have arrayed against each other in recent weeks.
""It's more important to make sure that the political and diplomatic situation stabilizes,"" he said. ""If that is stabilized then the armies can move back in due course.""
Powell will arrive in Pakistan on Wednesday and visit India on Thursday. He also plans to travel to Afghanistan to discuss reconstruction issues with the interim government there. The timing of his visit to Afghanistan has not been disclosed for security purposes.
Powell also said he will make a stop in Nepal to show support for the government as it attempts to cope with what he called a ""Maoist terrorist insurrection.""
He will be the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Nepal. The highest ranking U.S. official to travel to the Himalayan mountain kingdom was Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1970.
Powell's last stop will be Japan, where on Monday he plans to attend an international conference on reconstruction assistance for Afghanistan.
He clearly sees last Saturday's speech by Musharraf as a turning point in the Indo-Pakistan confrontation, which was sparked by an Islamic militant terrorist attack on the Indian parliament Dec. 13.
Powell expressed support for Pakistan's reported arrests of more than 1,000 Islamic radicals and for Musharraf's calls for sweeping reforms designed to curb the influence of militants in education and other areas.
India is outraged over Pakistan-based terrorist groups which oppose control by predominantly Hindu India over a portion of Muslim Kashmir.
Asked whether there was anything India could do to improve the lot of restive Kashmirans, Powell said, ""I think there are probably things they can do."" He said he will raise the issue with Indian foreign minister Jaswant Singh on Thursday. The main topic for Powell in Afghanistan will be the country's desperate economic situation.
""I hope I'll be able to give them good news,"" Powell said, alluding to dlrs 250 million in Afghan assets that were frozen during the period of Taliban rule and can soon be made available to the interim government.
There are three accounts due to be released, including dlrs 193 million in gold reserves.
Powell said it remains to be seen whether the Kabul government wants to use the funds to back their currency or to meet current operating expenses.
The administration has access to accounts containing dlrs 25 million, Powell said.
A similar amount is being held in escrow for Afghanistan by the International Air Transport Association.
The funds represent fees to which Afghanistan is entitled for overflights of its territory since United Nations Security Council sanctions were imposed several years ago.

"273",200285,"Title: Powell Embarks on Mission To South Asian Powder Keg.rtf; Date: January 16, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell headed today for perhaps his most delicate diplomatic mission: pressing India and Pakistan to defuse their confrontation over Kashmir, as the two nuclear-armed nations have hundreds of thousands of troops massed on their border.
     Secretary Powell, speaking to reporters aboard his plane, praised a weekend speech by Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and said it had helped to slow the rush toward conflict. But he left no doubt that, in the American view, Pakistan needed to do more to curb what India calls insufferable cross-border terrorism, and that India needed to respond. Kashmir is a mountainous region of Muslims and Hindus that was hastily divided between India and Pakistan in the late 1940's. 
 Indian officials have praised General Musharraf's pledge to reject all forms of terrorism, but have insisted on specific steps, particularly the surrender of some 20 suspected terrorists, before withdrawing their troops from forward positions. 
""That's one area that I'll be pursuing with both sides,"" said Secretary Powell, who lands in Islamabad on Wednesday and visits India on Thursday.
He compared the situation to ""an ocean liner or a car that's in forward gear,"" adding that ""before you can throw it into reverse, it's wise -- and probably the only thing you can do -- to get it stopped.""
In New Delhi, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said the three days since General Musharraf's pledges were ""not sufficient time to assess the situation,"" adding, ""We do expect visible action in regard to curbing cross-border terrorism and preventing infiltration in Jammu-Kashmir.""
His spokeswoman, Nirupama Rao, noted said ""we still haven't seen any give on the part of Pakistan"" in terms of the 20 wanted suspects. Although General Musharraf pledged never to hand over Pakistanis, 14 of the 20 are Indian citizens.
Secretary Powell reiterated that the United States had no wish to play a formal mediating role in the Kashmir dispute, which he said could be solved only by direct talks between the sides. But, he added, ""we would like to be helpful.""
In Islamabad today, General Musharraf restated Pakistan's unbending support for ""the Kashmir cause and the people of Kashmir."" He spoke at the initial meeting of a new national committee formed to promote his country's view on Kashmir abroad and to build international pressure on India to negotiate.
""We will continue to support the just freedom struggle of Kashmiris politically, diplomatically and morally,"" General Musharraf said.
By arresting some 1,400 militants around Pakistan, banning five militant groups and promising to turn the focus of any jihad from Islamic extremism to a general struggle against poverty, General Musharraf is walking on eggs politically.
Today's statement appeared to be part of his balancing act, intended to reassure the population that he will not sacrifice hallowed principles as he works to purge his country of violent extremists and ease the confrontation with India. Above all, he cannot be seen to be doing India's bidding.
According to Pakistan and to United Nations resolutions, Kashmir remains a disputed territory, its final status unresolved. But New Delhi considers Kashmir to be an integral part of India and refuses to accept international mediation.
India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir -- in 1947-48 and in 1965. In 1971 they fought over Bangladesh's independence. 
In the last 12 years, with the secret support of the Pakistan military, Muslim rebels have waged guerrilla warfare against Indian security forces in Kashmir, who have responded with often brutal tactics. 
The new national committee in Pakistan is headed by Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, a former prime minister of the Pakistan-held sector of Kashmir, and includes representatives from major regions and political parties, including a former cricket star turned politician and former government ministers.
Pakistani diplomats want to offset what they believe is a propaganda advantage gained by India on the Kashmir issue since attacks by Kashmiri militants backed by Pakistan in Srinagar, Kashmir, last October and on the Parliament in New Delhi on Dec. 13. By ending Pakistan's support of guerrillas in Kashmir, officials in Islamabad privately say, General Musharraf hopes to focus more world attention on its diplomatic and historical case. 
Indian officials say they realize that violent resistance will continue from within their part of Kashmir. But they expect it to decline significantly if Pakistan ends all covert support.
Secretary Powell confirmed earlier hints by the State Department that he would visit Katmandu, Nepal, on Friday to offer support to the monarchy there. The royal family is still grappling with the aftereffects of the assassination of the former king and other members of the royal family by the crown prince last year, and is battling a Maoist insurgency movement.

"274",2002902,"Title: Top Nepalese diplomat to discuss Maoist crackdown in US, Britain.rtf; Date: March 28, 2002 Thursday; Text: Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya is to visit the United States, Britain and Russia to muster international support for Nepal's fight against Maoist rebels, officials said Thursday.
Acharya will leave by the end of the month for Washington, where he will ask for more US assistance to Nepal, a foreign ministry official told AFP.
The trip follows a trip to the kingdom in January by Secretary of State Colin Powell, the highest-ranking US official to visit the Himalayan state in 30 years.
Nepal has requested from the United States a small number of advanced bullet-proof helicopters equipped with night vision to battle the rebels, who have been fighting to overthrow the constitutional monarchy since 1996.
Powell during his visit voiced support for the crackdown on the Maoists, who broke a four-month ceasefire in November, but stayed mum on what military assistance the United States would provide Nepal.
The foreign ministry official said Acharya would be the highest-level Nepalese visitor to Washington since the start of the Maoist rebellion.
The trip comes as the death toll from the insurgency mounts, particularly after the Maoists launched an offensive last month that killed 128 people, mostly soldiers and policemen.
The Maoists, whose support base is in the impoverished state's countryside, have recently mounted small-scale attacks around the capital Kathmandu.
After Washington, Acharya will visit London and Moscow, where he will also seek support for the crackdown on the rebels.
British assistant minister of state Ben Bradshaw visited Kathmandu on February 20 and said Britain was ready to help Nepal fight terrorism.
The foreign ministry official said Acharya would also brief US, British and Russian officials on Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's recent visit to India, which by treaty is Nepal's chief military supplier.
Acharya is Nepal's highest-ranking diplomat other than Deuba, who retains the foreign affairs portfolio.
Deuba has staunchly backed the US-led war on terrorism and offered to let US warplanes fly over Nepal.

"275",20022389,"Title: Senior US diplomat holds talks with Nepalese leaders.rtf; Date: December 13, 2002 Friday; Text: The United States' most senior South Asian envoy, Christina Rocca, held talks here Friday with Nepalese leaders on the kingdom's bloody Maoist insurgency, a foreign ministry official said.
The official said the discussions also touched on a range of bilateral issues and that Rocca met Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand for around 30 minutes.
""During the talks the two leaders discussed bilateral issues and cooperation between the US and Nepal,"" he said. ""They also discussed the ongoing Maoist insurgency problems faced by Nepal.""
Rocca met separately with foreign minister Narendra Bikram Shah and army chief Pyar Jung Thapa, with whom she discussed the military's ongoing battle against Maoist rebels.
She was due to meet King Gyanendra at the Royal Palace late Friday, the official said.
Rocca, who arrived late Thursday on three-day visit to Nepal, was also due to meet other political leaders on issues such as US assistance to combat terrorism, and security and development measures.
Rocca has made two previous trips to Nepal.
She was here last year when Sher Bahadur Deuba was premier, handing him a letter from President George W. Bush expressing Washington's ""continued support to protect democracy in Nepal"".
She also accompanied Secretary of State Colin Powell when he visited the Himalayan kingdom in January. Powell had expressed US support to Nepal in its fight against ""every form of terrorism"".
The rebellion will also be raised when Rocca holds talks with US embassy officials here on Saturday. Two embassy officials have been murdered by the Maoists in the past six months.
The rebels have also attacked several international non-government organizations in the outlying districts of Nepal.
The Maoists, who are staunchly anti-American, resent Washington giving the Nepalese government financial aid. They have twice attacked and badly damaged Coca-Cola factories in Nepal as a retaliatory move.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and set up a communist republic in Nepal. The insurgency has so far claimed over 7,300 lives.
During Rocca's earlier visits, Nepal had urged the United States to increase its investment here and allow Nepalese made garments duty free access to American markets.
Both Powell and Rocca had assured Nepal they would raise the issue with the US Congress.
Bush has asked Congress to approve 20 million dollars in military aid to Nepal to fight the Maoists, following several assessment trips by US officials, including Rocca.
Nepal reportedly wants semi-automatic and automatic weapons, helicopters with night vision capability and other equipment from the United States.
Rocca's trip comes as Prime Minister Chand continues his push for peace talks with the guerrillas.
Last week the Maoists said they had formed a committee to hold talks with the government and suggested they would halt their attacks on civilian infrastructure.
Last month the United States warned its citizens of heightened risks to their safety in Nepal after the rebels issued threats against its diplomats.

The two-day meeting of the Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism, the first since the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, focused on strengthening intelligence, border and aviation security and ways to curb the financing of terrorism via the Internet.
""Our working group is solid evidence that the United States and India have transformed their bilateral relationship and are today working together on many fronts to defend our common interests,"" said U.S. Ambassador at Large Francis X. Taylor, who is President George W. Bush's coordinator for counterterrorism.
""In our meetings tomorrow, for the first time in the Joint Working Group, we will discuss ways our militaries can cooperate against terrorism,"" Taylor told reporters.
The group was established two years ago and has held three meetings in Washington and New Delhi since then.
Taylor said the global fight against terrorism was going to be a three- to four-year year effort against Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorism network, spread out over more than 60 countries.
""We have been very, very happy with our success certainly militarily in Afghanistan. But that's only one aspect,"" Taylor said.
""This is a unique campaign in the sense that it is diplomatic, it is law enforcement, it is intelligence, it is financial. Those relationships take time to build and nurture to ensure long-term effectiveness,"" he said.
Since Sept. 11 and two major terrorist attacks in India, Washington and New Delhi have significantly increased their military ties.
Indian Defense Minister Lal K. Advani met with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in Washington last week. Robert S. Mueller, the FBI director, is arriving in New Delhi later Monday to meet with Advani and the director of India's federal bureau of investigation.
Indian newspapers said New Delhi wanted to discuss with Mueller its demand that Pakistan return the hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight that was commandeered from Nepal to Kandahar in Afghanistan in 1999.

Nepal was plunged into a fresh political crisis today after the governing party expelled Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba over his move to dissolve Parliament and call early elections.
     Mr. Deuba told reporters the expulsion would have no effect on his ability to remain caretaker prime minister of the poverty-stricken Himalayan kingdom, where security forces are battling an increasingly bloody Maoist insurgency. 
 But constitutional experts said it was unclear that Mr. Deuba could remain prime minister until the elections, set for Nov. 13.
""The Constitution is silent"" on this matter, said Bishwanath Upadhyaya, a retired chief justice who headed the panel that drafted the 1990 Constitution making Nepal a multiparty democracy. ""This is an unprecedented situation.""
Last week, Mr. Deuba asked King Gyanendra to disband Parliament and move up the elections by two years to Nov. 13 after his party rebelled against his move to extend emergency rule to fight the rebels who are seeking to topple the constitutional monarchy.
The revolt in which the Maoists are seeking to install a Communist government has raged since 1996 and has claimed more than 4,000 lives.
The dissidents within the party and the political opposition were against extending a state of emergency giving security forces sweeping powers, saying a new antiterrorist law already gave them enough authority to crush the rebels.
The dissidents, led by the former prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, whom Mr. Deuba replaced last July, were also unhappy because they were not consulted about extending emergency rule. But the caretaker government says emergency rule is still needed to help defeat the rebels.
The state of emergency was clamped on Nepal in November after the Maoist rebels walked out of peace talks and staged a series of raids on security posts.
The Nepalese Congress, known for its history of bitter infighting, suspended Mr. Deuba last Thursday and expelled him today for a term of three years.

""Rescuers are reporting that there could be 100 villagers who are missing,"" said Min Bahadur Poudel, an official at the Natural Calamity Disaster Management Center.
The landslides, caused by monsoon rains, swept through Dipsung and Sikundel on Monday.
An independent radio station said 50 people had died, but Poudel said the figure could be higher.
The residents of the villages, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of Katmandu, Nepal's capital, were asleep when the slides smashed 20 houses, Poudel said.
Rescuers reached the area by helicopter on Monday evening, but could not begin working until Tuesday because of heavy rain, Poudel said. Another team was leaving Katmandu on Tuesday with blankets, food and plastic sheeting.
Telephone links to the two villages were snapped when Maoist rebels destroyed a telecommunication center earlier this year. The Calamity Center was communicating with the rescue team through police radios.

Some 45 percent of the world's tuberculosis cases are recorded in South Asia alone, where many of the rural poor lack access to basic medical care, according to the World Health Organization.
In India, more than 1,000 people die every day from tuberculosis, which infects four more people every minute, said statistics released to observe World Tuberculosis Day.
In a message published in newspapers, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee appealed to health officials both inside and outside government to ensure that everyone with tuberculosis receives proper care.
""Tuberculosis kills more adults than any other infectious disease, kills more women than all causes of maternal mortality combined and creates more orphans than any other cause. It also disproportionately affects the poor,"" Vajpayee wrote.
But he said a government programme started three years ago to prevent and treat tuberculosis has covered 450 million people and saved 100,000 lives annually.
He said the programme would be expanded to cover 800 million people within two years.
TB is an infectious disease caused by a bacteria which attacks the lungs, glands, brain and genitals. Nearly two million people worldwide died of TB last year.
In Bangladesh, every year some 70,000 people die and 300,000 more people contract tuberculosis.
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia said poverty alleviation and improvement of Bangladesh's living standards must be linked to a national campaign against tuberculosis.
She said government hospitals nationwide were providing free treatment and medicine to TB patients.
But the disease often turns fatal in the impoverished country when patients fail to receive prescribed medication or close health supervision, said Maswoodur Rahman Prince, a Bangladeshi doctor.
He said TB not only kills and cripples its victims, but also forces hundreds of Bangladeshis to lose their jobs.
In Nepal, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called, in a message, for health workers and members of civil society to join ranks with the government to combat the disease.
Some 5,000 doctors, nurses and others took part in a rally in the capital Kathmandu, where banners read the slogan of World Tuberculosis Day: ""Let's prevent tuberculosis and combat poverty.""
The disease claims between 8,000 and 11,000 lives each year in Nepal, were about 44,000 new cases come up annually.
The government has set up some 229 treatment centers in all the kingdom's 75 districts to combat the disease.
Nepal is planning to start a strategy known as the directly observed treatment short-course, or DOTS, under which free diagnosis and treatment is offered to all.
The DOTS strategy has had a 90 percent cure rate in East Asian countries in which it has been implemented.
The symptoms of TB include a persistent cough which is not responsive to antibiotics, fever and weight loss. It may occur outside of the lungs in lymph nodes, bones, kidneys and the central nervous system.

"282",20022581,"Title: Nepal in chaos in 2002 as blood spills.rtf; Date: December 29, 2002 Sunday; Text: The year 2002 was a disaster for Nepal on all fronts, with thousands dying in a Maoist insurgency, the king sacking the elected government and economic growth plummeting to a 20-year low.
The Himalayan kingdom opened the year with a surge of violence after the Maoists renounced a ceasefire and unleashed a string of bloody attacks in their campaign to overthrow the monarchy.
Then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who the year before had pledged to make peace with the Maoists, in 2002 vowed to destroy them and paid a rare visit to Washington to win help in crushing the rebels he branded ""terrorists.""
As troops and guerrillas waged nearly daily battles nationwide, political fighting worsened in Kathmandu, and on Deuba's advice King Gyanendra sacked the parliament in May as it looked set to reject an extension of emergency rule.
Less than five months later, Deuba himself was sacked by the king, who declared the elected premier ""incompetent"" and replaced him with a staunch royalist, Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
The interim government is supposed to serve until new elections are held, but the king suspended polls and no new dates have been announced. For the first time since absolute royal rule ended in 1990, the political elite is openly accusing the palace of plotting against democracy.
Kong Gyanendra ascended the throne in June 2001 after his brother and nine others died at the hands of the drunken crown prince, who then turned the gun on himself.
The new king had pledged to follow in the footsteps of his moderate late brother King Birendra, recalled political scientist Prasant Thakur.
""The king's commitment on the day when he ascended the throne to protect democracy and play the role of a constitutional monarch ended when he dismissed an elected premier,"" Thakur said.
Deuba, once derided by his critics as a royalist, denounced the king as ""undemocratic."" In rare agreement, Nepal's major political parties have all refused to joining Chand's royal-backed cabinet.
""We are not going to accept the king's moves,"" said Deuba's predecessor as premier and longtime rival, Girija Prasad Koirala. ""We demand the revival of the multi-party system and the king should accept the role of a constitutional monarch.""
Despite overtures from the new government and the Maoists, the two sides have failed to resume dialogue. In the meantime, security forces and guerrillas have clashed with a new ferocity.
In several pitched battles this year, sparked either by Maoist assaults on security posts or army ambushes of rebel hideouts, the official death tolls have shot over 200.
At the end of 2001, security forces put the death toll at just over 2,300 for the Maoist insurgency launched in February 1996. On December 26, the toll more than tripled to 7,774.
Amnesty International on December 19 said that 4,366 people had been killed since the end of the ceasefire in November 2001. It said half the dead were civilians, a claim rejected by Nepal's army, which said most were rebels.
The Maoists, whose insurrection was launched in the isolated west of the kingdom, in 2002 increasingly set their sights on Kathmandu, launching a string of bombings which, while leaving few casualties, made the rebel presence known in the capital.
Hoping for shows of support, the Maoists repeatedly shut down Kathmandu and other parts of the kingdom in general strikes, attacking anyone defying shutdown orders. Kathmandu schools were closed for two weeks in December from a Maoist strike.
""Two months after the Chand government's formation, there is no sign of holding talks with the Maoists,"" said Sharda Man Vaidya, a leading activist against the absolute royal rule that ended in 1990.
While Western countries and Japan have cautiously continued aid, they have warned against travel to Nepal, hitting the kingdom's key tourism industry just as exports are declining.
Gross domestic product grew by only 0.6 percent in the fiscal year that ended in 2002, far below the projected 4.3 percent and the lowest figure in two decades.
Meanwhile, the kingdom's population is growing at 2.2 percent annually.
One of the few signs of stability was the foreign exchange reserve, which rose marginally to 1.36 billion dollars, or one year's worth of imports, thanks to remittances from Nepalese working abroad.

"284",2002701,"Title: Asian nations to continue fighting child domestic labor.rtf; Date: October 5, 2002, Saturday; Text: BANGKOK, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Asian countries which attended a latest meeting on child labor in northern Thailand have agreed on a framework for follow-up actions against the use of children in domestic work in the region.
According to a statement released here by the International Labor Office (ILO), some 100 Asian officials and experts held in- depth discussions on the issues of child domestic labor and reached agreements on several fronts at their gathering between Oct. 2 and 4 in northern Thai resort of Chiang Mai, 700 km north of Bangkok.
""On the issue of age, participants agreed that no child younger than 15 should be employed in domestic work and employing those aged between 15 and 17 under hazardous conditions is considered as being against international labor conventions,"" it said.
Delegates proposed several intervention strategies to curb the wide-spread problem of child domestic labor, including setting up regional guidelines for employment in domestic work, asking for reasonable payment and establishing a ""community watch"" system.
For those youth employed as domestic workers, participants called for free compulsory education and a registration system for young domestic workers.
They urged regional governments, in tandem with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and supporting bodies, to implement related measures at national level.
ILO Regional Director for Asia and Pacific Yasuyuki Nodera said a key challenge in dealing with the issue of child domestic labor in the region is that those children are often isolated and thus it is difficult to contact with their employers.
The three-day conference is organized by the ILO with support from the Japanese and South Korean governments. Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam also joined the meeting.
According to ILO figures, an estimated 211 million children world-wide aged 5-14 are engaged in some form of economic activity, with 186 million working in labor which should be abolished. Some 127 million economically active children, or 60 percent of the global sum, are in the Asia-Pacific region.
""Countries in the region face their own individual challenges in combating child domestic labor. While a good deal of legislation is already in place, enforcement has not proved to be satisfactory,"" said the ILO statement.

"286",20022652,"Title: Tons of fun as elephant polo kicks off in Thailand.rtf; Date: September 18, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Top-ranked polo players have converged on this sleepy resort town southwest of Bangkok, swapping their horses for elephants in a tournament aimed at raising awareness of the plight of the endangered animals.
Carrying elongated polo mallets -- and traveling at a far slower clip than normal -- Singaporean and Australian squads lumbered onto a specially prepared polo field at a military base and launched their five-day quest for the Kings Cup.
They were among 10 teams competing in the tournament, the second in Thailand following the highly touted inaugural event last year. Squads from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Australia, Germany and the kingdom have each paid the 5,000 dollar entrance fee to participate.
An elaborate opening ceremony took place Tuesday afternoon, with players decked out in their game jerseys and leather boots, sipping on Bloody Marys and giving each other tips on this quirky version of their elite sport.
As soon as young workers swept the pitch clear of dung, a series of practice matches took place to allow man and beast to get to know one another -- and to familiarize the players with Thai-language commands.
Beautiful but bizarre, the game of elephant polo -- versions of which were played in the jungles of Asia during the years when the beasts of burden were used for logging, transport, even as battle warriors -- was yanked from the dustbin of history in 1982 by a pair of unlikely proponents of the game.
""We thought it was a very good idea for a party,"" said Jim Edwards, the boss of a Nepal-based elephant safari business who along with polo afficionado James Manclark dreamed up the idea on a vacation at a Swiss chalet.
""James said, you play polo, you have elephants, lets play it on elephants.""
Within the year the game was revived in Nepal, where Edwards has run expeditions in the jungles for more than 40 years.
The Himalayan nation now hosts an elephant polo tournament each year, as does Sri Lanka. Thailand has joined the ranks of the steadily expanding international tour, which some players here said they want to see grow into a genuine league.
The game pits two three-a-side teams of pachyderm, player and perhaps the most important ingredient, the mahout, who controls his ride and translates the will of the player to the animal.
While far slower than the equine version of the game, the players are intrigued by the elephants intelligence, and their seemingly intuitive play on the pitch.
""Its a rush trying to get a huge elephant from one spot to another, all by telling your mahout where to go,"" said Peter Prendville, owner of Sandalford Wineries in Australia.
""Quite often the elephants just race right after the ball with no prodding,"" noted Edwards.
Despite the sporting appeal, those involved say that increasing awareness of the Asian elephant is a crucial aspect of the tournament.
""A lot of these people here care about the plight of these animals,"" Prendville said. ""If we can put relevance into what theyre doing, were happy.""
Some 700,000 baht (16,300 dollars) is expected to be raised for elephant conservation efforts in northern Thailand during the event.
Thailand has roughly 2,500 domesticated elephants, down from 100,000 a century ago, according to Chanatt Lauhawatana, managing director of the forest industry organization.
""Elephant polo is a great opportunity to highlight the work of the National Elephant Institute and raise awareness and funds, both of which are desperately needed,"" he said.
Conservationists are aware of the potential divisiveness that involving elephants in sport may cause.
""It is obvious that elephants shouldnt be playing polo, they should be off in the forest,"" concedes elephant expert Richard Lair who helped plan the inaugural event.
Lair has worked for decades with Thailands elephants and last year made headlines by creating an elephant orchestra whose melodies have been recorded on CD and sold worldwide.
""But the fact is, in 21st century Thailand, the only legal work for elephants is basically in tourism and entertainment. Its just a matter of harsh reality,"" he said.
Lair said money raised by the tournament would help fund veterinary mobile clinics, transport vehicles, and research into the species.

"287",20022510,"Title: Nepal rebel leader repeats call for peace talks.rtf; Date: July 19, 2002 Friday 200207190114; Text: The leader of Nepal's Maoist rebels, who are waging an armed insurrection in the Himalayan kingdom, has reiterated his call for peace talks with the government.
Chairman of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) Prachanda said Thursday in a statement that his party would 'seriously make a strong appeal to all pro-people forces for seeking a resolution to the problem through talks and dialogue.'
'Talks, dialogue, and an interim government as well as an electoral process under the leadership of the interim government, would form the minimum basis for the resolution of the problem for the present,' the Maoist chief said in the statement, which was published by major Nepalese newspapers Friday.
The rebel leader also called on all political parties to oppose the state of emergency imposed last November to crush the rebels.
On the mid-November elections, the underground party has long held the position that it would oppose them and seek to upset them.
In May, King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and announced general elections for Nov. 13, apparently giving Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba a free hand to take tough measures against the Communist rebellion without parliamentary interference.
The move came hours after Deuba's ruling Nepali Congress Party rejected his plan to extend the state of emergency. The government later renewed it.
The rebels held three rounds of peace talks with the Deuba government last year, but they then walked out of negotiations saying the government was nowhere near meeting the Maoist demand to scrap the country's constitutional monarchy.
The government responded by imposing a state of emergency in late November and ordering its regular army to fight the rebels.
Eight months later, the government has made claims the army scored huge successes over the rebels, making a big dent in the latter's capability to fight or launch major attacks.
Although being resolute in his refusal to hold any more peace talks until the rebels surrender their arms, Deuba has come under pressure from the international community to soften his posture and start new negotiations.
The rebels may be more eager to talk because they have lost both domestic and external support for their campaign of violence and terror in the once peaceful mountain kingdom.
Prachanda's statement came in the wake of an Indian government's crackdown on the Maoist network in India and threats to deport senior Nepalese rebel leaders who are believed to have taken shelter in India.
The outlawed Maoist party took up arms against government forces in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and multiparty rule.
More than 5,000 Nepalese, mostly rebels and police, have been killed since the outbreak of the insurgency.

"288",20021029,"Title: Animals sacrificed after Nepalese royals visit Indian temple.rtf; Date: June 27, 2002 Thursday; Text: Ignoring protesters, Nepal's royal priest witnessed the ritual sacrifice of a buffalo, sheep, goat and duck Thursday after the country's visiting king and queen prayed at an Indian temple devoted to the Hindu goddess of power.
Plans to kill the animals in connection with the royal visit had raised an outcry by animal rights activists. Usually, worshippers watch the animals being killed as part of the ceremony. However, in an apparent effort to avoid trouble, the king and queen did not attend the sacrifice but left their priest to take part.
The ritual killings by temple priests took place an hour after the monarch and his wife had left, a temple official said.
""One buffalo, one sheep, one goat and one duck were sacrificed in the presence of royal Nepalese priest Raghunath Aryal,"" said Anup Sharma, a temple spokesman.
Aryal was not available for comment.
Police sharpshooters watched over the Kamakhya Temple in eastern Assam state earlier Thursday, as a barefoot King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and Queen Komal spent just over an hour inside.
Animal sacrifice is rare in India, but is central to the worship of the goddess, Kamakhya.
An animal, such as a buffalo, is decapitated and a lamp is placed on its bloody head in a tantric ceremony aimed at acquiring and using mystical power.
Although the ritual is centuries old, Thursday's visit of the Nepalese royals drew strong protests from Indian animal rights activists who cited a law against the killing of animals in public places.
Before the king and queen arrived, police dispersed some two dozen protesters. They carried signs that read: ""We request King Gyanendra to stay away from sacrificing buffalo at the temple,"" and, ""Animal sacrifice is a punishable offense.""
The activists were later allowed to protest five kilometers (three miles) from the temple, said Sangeeta Goswami of the People for Animals group.
The king returns to Nepal on Saturday, after five days in India. It is his first trip abroad since he came to the throne after his brother was killed last June in a palace massacre by Nepal's crown prince.

"289",20022012,"Title: Musharraf accuses India of _continuously threatening_ Pakistan.rtf; Date: June 4, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf accused India on Tuesday of ""continuously threatening"" to attack his country while refusing to enter into talks.
""India is continuously threatening Pakistan with an attack and refusing dialogue with Pakistan,"" Musharraf told reporters following a regional summit here also attended by Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
His comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin held separate meetings with Musharraf and Vajpayee in a bid to launch direct negotiations between the leaders of the two nuclear powers over their border dispute.
Musharraf said that Putin had invited him to Moscow, and had also invited Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, but it was not clear if the two leaders were invited at the same time.
""I will be going but I cannot speak for Vajpayee. As far as we are concerned whether it is for trilateral or bilateral we are in for any kind of mediation,"" he said.
President Vladimir Putin, for his part, said that he had invited Musharraf to Russia but that he would pay a visit to India.
""I have invited President Musharraf for a visit to Russia that he has accepted… and I will go myself to India before the end of the year,"" Putin said.
Officials said Putin's trip to India would come in December.
The leaders were speaking after a regional summit in Almaty, which has been dominated by the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and efforts to end a military stand-off.
Musharraf said Pakistan wanted to see the de-nuclearisation of South Asia and added: ""We are for the signing of a no war pact.""
The president said the 16-nation gathering had been successful in making its declaration against terrorism but he said ""the whole world was disappointed"" that he and Vajpayee had not held direct talks.
""But I think the world has got disappointed because of the denial of a meeting by Prime Minister Vajpayee with myself,"" said Musharraf.
""Pakistan appreciates the world concern towards the tensions between India and Pakistan.""
Vajpayee on Tuesday once again rejected Pakistan's offer of talks until there is an end to what India calls ""cross-border terrorism"" in Kashmir.
Musharraf told journalists that no meeting had taken place with Vajpayee.
""No, I did not meet him and no I did not shake hands with him. I shook hands with him once before and I was waiting for him to reciprocate.""
At a South Asian security meeting in Nepal in January Musharraf effectively stole the show when he strode across the stage after making a speech and unexpectedly shook hands with Vajpayee.
India accuses Pakistan of arming, funding and pushing militants in Indian Kashmir to wage war against its security forces.
A rebellion against Indian rule which has raged in the state since 1989 has claimed more than 35,000 lives.
In January Musharraf made a landmark speech saying he would crackdown on extremist groups in Kashmir.
Shortly afterwards thousands of people were arrested, but most were released.
The president said 1,065 people were still behind bars in connection with the crackdown.

""We are ready to call a ceasefire and resume political dialogue on condition that a positive political way is found,"" Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachand said, according to the Nepali-language Rajdhani and other local newspapers.
It was the second time in two months that the Maoists have offered some kind of truce. In February Prachand said the Maoists had ""never closed the door for peace talks with the government.""
The most recent offer was dismissed by the government as meaningless. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has said that until the rebels surrender their arms, there is no possibility of negotiations.
Bimalendra Niddhi, a member of the central working committee of the ruling Nepali Congress party, said Prachand's statement was ""irrelevant and insignificant.""
""It is not a new thing that the Maoist leader Prachand has been issuing statements for the peace dialogue,"" he said.
In November the government imposed a state of emergency and deployed the army for the first against the rebels after they broke a four-month ceasefire and pulled out of peace talks.
Last month the emergency was ratified by parliament and extended for a further three months.
The army has been carrying out operations in rural areas where there are rebel strongholds and more than 400 guerrillas have been killed since November.
On Friday five rebels were shot dead by security forces in the southwestern Kapilbastu district, a defence ministry press release said Saturday. Arms and ammunition were also recovered.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed the lives of over 2,600 people.

The monarch, who has yet to agree to a meeting, was scheduled to fly back to Katmandu later Thursday from his ancestral home in Gorkha, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the capital.
The king, queen and crown prince were taking part in religious ceremonies in Gorkha, palace officials said on condition of anonymity.
Politicians from Nepal's six largest parties have been waiting since Monday to discuss the country's political future with the king, after he fired the prime minister and disbanded Cabinet last Friday. He also indefinitely postponed elections scheduled to begin Nov. 13.
The king dismissed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his cabinet after Deuba asked the monarch to postpone parliamentary elections by a year because of the threat of disruption by Maoist rebels, who have been fighting a violent insurgency to end the monarchy altogether.
It was the first time since the end of Nepal's absolute monarchy in 1990 that a king has ousted an elected government and its leader.
Gyanendra ascended to the throne last year after his brother - former King Birendra - and eight other royal family members were killed in a palace massacre. A government inquiry found that the then-crown prince shot the other victims before taking his own life.
Royal aides had earlier said a new government would be in place by Saturday, when Nepal's biggest religious festival begins.
""The proposed meeting has been delayed, but the king cannot just ignore the stand taken by the six largest political parties in the country,"" said Sushil Koirala, vice president of Nepali Congress, the largest party.
The king had set a five-day deadline - now passed - for political parties to propose a leader for an interim government. In the meantime, the king has executive power.
None of the parties has suggested any names.
""We are not going to give any names until the king grants the audience and explains the modalities, agenda and tenure of the interim government,"" said Koirala.
Since the massacre, the Maoist rebels have intensified their attacks, forcing the king to impose a national state of emergency last year.
The state of emergency - which severely restricted freedom of speech, press and assembly - was lifted in August to allow campaigning for the November elections. But subsequent rebel attacks prompted the prime minister to seek a delay in the polls.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have fought since 1996 to impose communist rule. More than 5,000 people, mostly rebels, have been killed in the insurgency.

In the wake of King Gyanendra's dissolution of the government and proposals to hold party-less elections, some 73 percent of Nepalese still support the multi-party system, said the survey by the Centre for Economic and Social Development, a Kathmandu-based non-governmental organisation.
""The majority of the Nepalese people preferred a multiparty system of government but want reforms in the governance,"" the study said.
It said the poll was taken of 4,000 people in six of Nepal's 75 districts that were found to be representative.
The survey said 11 percent of Nepalese wanted a single-party system, nine percent a Maoist state and three percent a military regime.
The Maoists have been waging a bloody insurrection since 1996 that has claimed more than 7,300 lives, according to security forces' figures.
The king on October 4 dismissed the elected prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, calling him ""incompetent"", and replaced him with a staunch royalist, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who will head the government until new elections are held.
However, no date has been set for parliamentary polls.
Chand's home minister, Dharma Bahadur Thapa, infuriated political parties this week when he proposed some 200,000 local council positions, which have been vacant since July, be decided in non-partisan elections.
Nepal's king ruled absolute from 1960 to 1990, with national parliamentarians forbidden from party affiliations.
The leading political parties have refused to participate in the Chand government, saying the king had betrayed the ideals of the 1990 constitution, which was adopted after mass pro-democracy protests.
One of the survey's authors, former ambassador to the European Commission and former National Planning Commission member Durgesh Man Singh, said political infighting had led Nepalese to believe that the major players ""lack earnestness"" in addressing the kingdom's ills.
""To tackle the problems, the conflict between the mainstream political forces must come to an end,"" Singh said.
He said the study also found strong support for a renewal of dialogue between the government and the Maoists.
""The people want dialogue to begin as early as possible but due to a lack of commitment by the concerned parties, things are just not taking shape,"" he said.

The army said 10 rebels were killed in fresh fighting.
The attacks came days after rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians in the deadliest assault in their six-year insurrection.
The rebels attacked the police post at Sitalpati, about 250 miles west of the capital, Katmandu, on Thursday night.
The two sides exchanged gunfire into Friday morning, police told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Details about the incident were sketchy because authorities lost communication with the police post overnight.
The army also continued a sweep against the rebels, gunning down six rebel fighters at Karthali village, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Katmandu on Thursday night, the defense ministry said. Elsewhere in the country, four other rebels were killed.
The violence came a day after the army said it killed at least 48 rebels in the Achham and Doti districts, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of Katmandu.
Rebels bombed the bus as it drove through Bhandara, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Katmandu. The bus was heading out of the capital toward the southern border town of Birgunj, defying a rebel call for a nationwide general strike Friday and Saturday.
Most passengers escaped by smashing the window panes of the bus, police said. Authorities imposed a dusk to dawn curfew in the area.
Similar curfews were announced in five other districts Friday to prevent any attacks by the rebels.
Meanwhile, most shops and businesses downed their shutters in the capital after the rebels called the strike to celebrate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency.
Most buses and taxis stayed off the road. Some government and private vehicles ran their routes, but many government workers were forced to walk to their offices.
Police and army forces patrolled the streets as security was beefed up to avoid a rebel strike in the capital.
On Thursday, Nepal's Parliament extended the state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom by another three months.
The emergency was imposed Nov. 26 after rebels abruptly broke off peace talks and resumed fighting government forces.
Some 550 guerrillas and 332 soldiers and police officers have been killed since then, officials said, and another 1,400 rebels have been arrested.
Last weekend, rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians in an attack on the Achham district headquarters and a nearby airport.
Nearly 2,500 people have been killed since the rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, began fighting six years ago for the abolition of constitutional monarchy. They are led by the elusive Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
Analysts say the Maoist campaign has grown on fertile ground. This tiny, Himalayan kingdom has been beset by crushing poverty and a succession of weak elected governments after King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah gave up absolute monarchy in 1990.
The adored monarch was killed last year by his son, then-Crown Prince Dipendra.

At least one armed guerrilla was killed by the security forces in Dadeldhura district in far western Nepal and three others were killed in the other districts of the country, the daily said, quoting a press release issued Saturday night by the Nepali Defense Ministry.
The government security forces also arrested 37 suspected guerrillas terrorists from some districts and seized a large amount of arms, ammunitions and explosives from the guerrillas side, the press release added.
Meanwhile, over 10,000 guerrillas have surrendered to the authorities of the country since the government imposed a state of emergency on November 26 last year and mobilized the army to curb the terrorist violence.
More than 600 guerrillas and over 100 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The six-year-long guerrillas insurgency has claimed  more than 2,300 lives, including army soldiers, policemen, civilians and the guerrillas, in the Himalayan Kingdom.

"298",20022590,"Title: Security forces say 49 Maoist rebels killed over past two days.rtf; Date: September 22, 2002 Sunday; Text: Thirty-eight Maoist rebels were killed in a series of clashes with the army over the past two days, and another 11 died when explosives they were carrying went off accidentally, army and police said Sunday.
The army didn't suffer any casualties during the clashes, said Shiv Kumar Thapa, a military spokesman.
There was no independent confirmation of the security forces' reports. The rebels, who are fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy, rarely comment on government claims. They operate from remote mountainous areas and cannot normally be contacted.
In the latest round of clashes, the army on Saturday killed 17 rebels in a major sweep of the Rolpa district, 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Nepal's capital, Katmandu, Thapa said.
Another eight rebels were killed in skirmishes in the Dadelbhura region, 600 kilometers (375 miles) northeast of Katmandu, the spokesman said.
The army gunned down six guerrillas in Chitwan, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of Katmandu, on Friday and Saturday. Elsewhere, seven guerrillas were killed in several operations, the spokesman said.
Eleven guerrillas died Saturday night when explosives they were carrying went off accidentally in Fatehpur village, 550 kilometers (345 miles) west of Katmandu, said senior police officer Gokarna Bahadur Pal.
The guerrillas were having dinner in their village hide-out when the accident occurred, Pal added. Police have found the bodies.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to impose communist rule based on the tenets of Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They have intensified their attacks since a state of emergency was lifted last month to allow free campaigning ahead of parliamentary elections in November.
On Saturday, the chief of the Maoist rebels threatened to disrupt the polls if the government ignored his offers of a cease-fire.
In a statement faxed to news organizations, Pushpa Kamal Dahal - more commonly known as Prachanda - said he has called for a three-day general strike coinciding with the Nov. 12 polls.
The government has rejected talk of a cease-fire, calling it a ploy by the insurgents to gain time to regroup.
Emergency rule was declared last year after the rebels abruptly ended peace talks with the government and resumed attacks on military and police. The emergency rule curbed civil liberties and gave security forces sweeping powers to detain people without trial.

"299",20022516,"Title: India , Pakistan leaderless and at loggerheads.rtf; Date: January 3, 2002 Thursday; Text: The leaders of India and Pakistan both left home Thursday, with their respective armies locked in a hazardous border stand-off despite renewed diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions between the nuclear-capable rivals.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf both left for Nepal where they will attend a South Asian regional summit that begins Friday.
While Vajpayee took the direct route to Kathmandu, Musharraf opted for a stop-over in close ally China -- a decision prompted as much by the closure of Indian air space to Pakistani aircraft as much as a sudden desire for talks with Beijing, just 10 days after his last visit.
""By coming to Beijing again, he wants to show that he has the support of China"" in the standoff with India, one western diplomat in the Chinese capital said.
India has ruled out any one-to-one meeting between the two leaders at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, arguing that Pakistan had yet to respond adequately to demands that it crack down on militant groups blamed for last month's attack on India's parliament.
It was hoped that talks between the two countries' foreign ministers at the SAARC summit could pave the way for defusing the explosive situation.
But India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, speaking from Kathmandu late Thursday, said no request for a meeting had been made by his Pakistani counterpart Abdul Sattar.
Escalating military tensions in the wake of the December 13 attack brought the two countries to the brink of a fourth war, although both have repeatedly stressed they want to avoid an armed conflict.
Pakistani and Indian troops traded fire overnight in the hotly disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir, where suspected Muslim militants Wednesday launched their second attack in three months on the Indian Kashmir state assembly in Srinagar, killing two.
""I don't think war is a necessity. I will put in all efforts to avoid it,"" Vajpayee told reporters in the northern city of Lucknow, shortly before leaving for Kathmandu.
""If diplomatic methods can be applied to resolve the existing problems, I don't see why we should resort to other means,"" Vajpayee said, while also ruling out any nuclear strike by India.
But Vajpayee also said there could be no bilateral talks with Pakistan until ""cross-border terrorism is stopped.""
Vajpayee cited Wednesday's grenade attack outside the state legislature in Srinagar as evidence that Pakistan ""has no intention to give up on terrorism.""
Musharraf declared Wednesday that Pakistan wants peace with India but not at the cost of its honour and dignity.
""Pakistan wants peace and de-escalation but should a mistake of attacking Pakistan be made they would regret their decision,"" he said. ""Our deterrence is complete in all respects, on the ground, air and on the high seas.""
India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since independence from British rule in 1947 -- two of them over Kashmir.
Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said diplomatic efforts to defuse the current crisis were ""going on the right track"" but said tensions could only ease with the reversal of India's military build-up.
The leaders of both nations have been bombarded with phone calls from the leaders of the United States, the United Nations and other governments and groupings, urging restraint and dialogue.
""As far as the results of our diplomatic efforts are concerned, everyone has emphasised that there was a need to de-escalate the situation, to reduce tensions and everybody is agreed on that,"" Khan said.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived in Bangladesh on Friday at the start of a five-day South Asia tour that will focus on the Indo-Pakistan military standoff.
""The most important thing is to try to exert as strong and calming an influence as possible in a situation that obviously is potentially serious,"" Blair told reporters on his plane.
Blair, who held lengthy telephone discussions with US President George Bush prior to his trip, will fly to India on Friday and then on to Pakistan early next week.
""I'm not going to start telling each country how to run their own affairs. This is not my objective,"" Blair stressed.
""But of course what we want is for Pakistan to take action against terrorism, and on the Indian side to try and de-escalate the tension as much as possible. But the two things are obviously linked.""

""At least 128 people including 48 soldiers, 75 policemen, four civil servants and a civilian were killed in three attacks by Maoist insurgents in western and southern Nepal on Saturday night,"" a cabinet source said.
Among the dead soldiers, their commander, a major was also killed, the source said.
The cabinet convened an emergency session to discuss the attacks, the fiercest since the government declared a state of emergency in the country in November.
Security forces have been kept on high alert fearing further attacks by the rebels in the Nepalese capital and outlying districts.
Most of the victims were killed in two attacks in the western Accham district, 350 kilometres (225 miles) west of the capital.
Four policemen were also killed and five injured in another Maoist attack in the southern Sarlahi district.
A defence ministry official said more than 100 rebels could have been killed in the action at Accham, but this could not be confirmed as the rebels carried away the bodies of their fallen colleagues. The bodies of three Maoist rebels were found late Sunday in Accham, the source said.
The attacks came as Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba prepared to ask parliament for an extension to the three-month emergency measures.
A home ministry source told AFP that in Accham the Maoists had first attacked the Saphebagar airport at about midnight on Saturday.
They had then moved on to the area's administrative centre Mangelsen and bombed the district offices, killing the district's top officer and an intelligence chief before looting a number of guns and communication equipment.
They also raided a bank and the local tax collection centre, the defence ministry souce said without saying how much money was taken, if any.
Paratroopers despatched to Mangelsen drove the Maoists out after they had controlled the area for about six hours, Defence Secretary P. K. Acharya said.
""The district headquarters is now under the complete control of the government though the Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khatri and Intelligence Department Chief Lokraj and his wife were killed in the attacks,"" the home ministry source said.
A photographer was also killed, a cabinet source said.
Unconfirmed reports said security forces pursued the Maoists in helicopters and shot at them from the air.
Four policemen in Lalbandi were killed when rebels attacked a post manned by 22 officers late Saturday. Five other police officers were injured in the attack.
The Maoists then disrupted the national highway for several hours.
The state of emergency was imposed November 26 after the rebels broke a ceasefire following a break-down in peace talks with the government.
The extension must be approved by two-thirds majority in parliament and Deuba's ruling Nepali Congress controls 113 of the 205 parliamentary seats.
Opposition leaders have told Deuba they will support his motion if he agrees to change the constitution to form an interim government to hold a free and fair general election in 2004 and to set up a social welfare scheme.
""Deuba, however, is facing a grave challenge from his own party's MPs and senior leaders pressing him to resign for allegedly failing to solve the Maoist problem and give good governance by controlling corruption,"" a Nepali Congress Parliament G. B. Shah said.
The premier had claimed the emergency and deployment of the army and armed police force had helped to maintain law and order in the districts while the people were beginning to feel more secure.
""We cannot control the Maoist terrorism in a short time after their six-year anti-monarchy and anti-democratic government,"" Deuba had told reporters last week.
The Maoists have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed the lives of more than 2,300 people.

Just hours after parliament voted to extend a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom late Thursday, the rebels attacked a police post at Sitalpati, 260 kilometres (162 miles) west of Kathmandu, leaving 36 dead.
Early Friday a petrol bomb was thrown at a bus in southern Nepal killing five civilians as a two-day nationwide strike called by the Maoists came into effect at dawn.
""A group of rebels stopped the bus at Bhandara in southern Nepal and ordered all the passengers to get out,"" Deputy Home Minister Devendra Raj Kandel said.
They then threw a petrol bomb into the bus killing five passengers, who were still inside and apparently asleep, he said.
Also early Friday a bomb planted by suspected rebels in the centre of Kathmandu exploded injuring a young boy, officials said.
The device had been hidden inside a plastic container and it went off when the boy, who was collecting plastic, picked it up.
More than 240 people have died since the weekend in attacks by the rebels who launched their insurgency in 1996 in a bid to topple the constitutional monarchy.
More than 150, mostly soldiers and police, died in the weekend attacks, following by another 51 rebels killed on Wednesday in clashes with security personnel in western and southwestern Nepal.
So far over 2,400 people have died in the rebellion.
On Thursday the parliament voted overwhelmingly to extend the state of emergency first imposed in November for another three months.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba had proposed the extension saying it was required to completely crush the rebellion and managed to overcome concern from opposition party members who said it could infringe civil rights.
Just hours later a group of guerrillas attacked a police post manned by 85 officers, Kandel said.
In the ensuing one-and-a-half hour battle, at least 32 policemen and four Maoists were killed.
""The Maoist casualties must be more than four but only the four bodies were found on the site of the incident,"" the minister told AFP.
The violence came ahead of the general strike which brought the capital Kathmandu to a halt Friday as the Maoists marked the sixth anniversary of the launch of their ""people's war"" on February 13, 1996.
Shops, colleges, factories and many offices were closed and there were few vehicles on the streets.
Residents said the shut-down was not in support of the Maoist cause, but rather because people were scared of further attacks.
""Factories are closed because of the fear of being attacked by the Maoists,"" a spokesman of the Federation of the Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry said.
Security personnel in armoured vehicles patrolled the streets, as police searched the bags of virtually every passer-by.
The state of emergency, which was first introduced on November 26 after the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire with the government and backed out of peace talks, will now run until May 25.

At least 10 anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot Sunday in Mugu district and three others were killed in Rolpa district, while another one was killed Monday in Dhading district.
All the districts are located in western Nepal, the press release said.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fire with the government security forces, and the government forces also seized some arms, ammunition and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations in these districts, it added.
More than 1,000 guerrillas and over 300 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed a state of emergency on November 26 last year following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces. The guerrillas broke four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepalese government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency. The insurgency has claimed  more than 4,000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

Deepak Prasad Pokharel was sleeping at his home in Kathmandu when three assailants entered, shot him at close range and escaped, a home ministry official told AFP.
Police have not caught any suspects, but local radio said the attack was likely carried out by Maoist rebels who are fighting to topple the monarchy and are staunchly anti-American.
Pokharel supervised security arrangements for US government institutions in Nepal, including the embassy.
""The three men entered the house at around 3:00 pm (0945 GMT) and asked, 'Where is Mr Pokharel?'"" the home ministry official said.
""One family member, a girl, took them upstairs. When they saw Mr Pokharel they shot him dead and then ran away.""
It was the second killing of a security official at a US institution in Nepal in the past 11 months.
On December 15 last year a guard at the mission of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in Kathmandu, Ramesh Manandhar, was shot dead while on duty in another attack attributed to the Maoists.
No one has been apprehended in Mandahar's killing and the US embassy in Kathmandu just last week offered a 500,000-rupee (about 6,750-dollar) reward for information leading to the arrest of the assailants.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state. They frequently accuse the United States and neighboring India of conspiring against them.
President George W. Bush's administration has asked the US Congress to approve 20 million dollars in military aid to Nepal to fight the Maoists.
The Nepalese army estimates more than 7,000 people have died in the kingdom since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996.
The rebels exercise de facto control over large sections of the kingdom where they often destroy any infrastructure built by the Kathmandu government or foreign donors.

"306",200296,"Title: Nepal Battle Intensifying After Attack On Rebels.rtf; Date: May 9, 2002 Thursday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
The warfare between the Royal Nepal Army and Maoist guerrillas has intensified over the past week in the heartland of Maoist-controlled western Nepal, an isolated, mountainous region where battles are being fought many hours' hike from the nearest road.
     Four days after Nepal's security forces struck a major Maoist base hidden deep in the forest, hundreds of rebels began a devastating counterattack late Tuesday night on an army and police post in a remote village called Gam, Nepalese military officials said today. 
 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who has been in Washington seeking military assistance as the fighting rages in Nepal, said today after meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the administration's proposed $20 million in aid was not enough. ""I didn't ask for more,"" he said, ""but I am hopeful they will increase the amount next year.""
The United States also plans to almost double development aid to Nepal, to $38 million in 2003 from $21 million in 2001.
The death toll from the rebels' six-year insurgency is thought to be approaching 4,000, but the uncertainties inherent in guerrilla warfare have been intensified by restrictions on journalists' access to the battlefields.
Nepal's Ministry of Defense asserted in a press release that more than 350 rebels were killed on Friday when security forces fought them near a Maoist base in the western district of Rolpa.
But in an interview today, an army official said that report was mistaken. Fewer than 100 Maoists died, he said, and only 20 to 30 of their bodies were found. The rebels dragged away many of their dead before they could be counted, leaving bloody trails through the woods, he said.
Tana Gautam, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, conceded the error today. ""The number of bodies that were ultimately recovered didn't quite reach that number that we said,"" he said. ""It does raise a question of credibility.""
Nepal needs all the credibility it can get now that it is aggressively seeking foreign aid.
Nepalese military officials have told their American counterparts that the army needs night-vision goggles to fight an enemy that attacks by surprise in darkness. They say it also needs more transport helicopters so it can deploy men quickly in rugged terrain. And front-line troops need flak jackets and new lightweight rifles to replace the more than 30-year-old wooden-stock ones they carry now. The weapons fail to fire about a third of the time, Nepalese and Western officials say.
As the army seeks to reclaim territory taken by the Maoists, the battles are playing out in some of the most inaccessible parts of Nepal.
When security forces were tipped off about a large contingent of Maoists in the Rolpa district, about 100 soldiers and policemen hiked eight hours through Thursday night to get there, each carting his own food, gun, ammunition and sleeping gear.
The next morning, the government forces discovered that they had stumbled onto a large permanent Maoist base, Western and Nepalese officials said. The troops found bunkers, small houses, water buffalo and food stocks.
Later, when an army officer decided he wanted to join his forces for the engagement, there was no helicopter to take him. Instead, he rode a bus for two hours, then hiked for another four hours.
""This is your commander,"" said a Western official who spent last week in Rolpa district. ""And that's how he got there. It's pathetic.""
The Maoists struck back in the village of Gam. The government had retaken it just last month after four or five years of Maoist control. A school had been rebuilt and a health clinic had reopened. Two weeks ago, villagers elected their first government in years, said a Western official who visited last week.
Gam is almost certainly back in Maoist hands tonight. And the teachers, clinic workers and elected officials who risked rejoining the Nepalese mainstream are now vulnerable to the wrath of rebels who often see such people as collaborators.
There are no phones in Gam or roads that lead there. An hour after the Maoist attack began at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the village was cut off when officers could not raise the wireless radio operator at the post.
An army spokesman said it was assumed that after soldiers and policemen ran out of ammunition in Gam, hundreds of Maoists overran the post and killed all the security forces there. But he also said the army did not really know yet what happened because no one had yet reached the village to investigate.
Military officials gave varying estimates of the number of men at the post; some said 90, others 120. 
""We fear this is a big loss for our side,"" one officer said.

Tikaram Rai, editor of the Nepali-language newspaper Aparana (Afternoon), was taken away by police from his office in the capital Kathmandu, activists said.
Police would not comment on the detention.
Two press freedom groups, the Nepal Press Union and the Nepal Federation of Journalists, said Rai was detained because of his newspaper's investigations of police corruption.
The daily recently wrote that a senior police officer had pocketed 16 million rupees (about 215,000 dollars) by selling licenses to motorists who had not taken examinations.
The journalist federation's vice chairman, Gopal Budhathoki, said he worried about freedom of the press under Nepal's new government, which was appointed last month by King Gyanendra after he dismissed the elected prime minister.
""The new administration is gradually curbing freedom of expression. We demand that journalists be given the freedom to report,"" he said.
But the new government, headed by royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand, on November 5 released six journalists sympathetic to Maoist rebels who had been imprisoned for a year.
The release was considered a goodwill gesture to persuade the rebels to give up a three-day national strike against the king's dismissal of the government.
But the Maoists have rejected the administration's overtures and went ahead with the strike, which shut down Kathmandu both Monday and Tuesday.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy. The conflict has left dead more than 7,000 people, according to army figures.
Nepal has come under international criticism for its detentions of journalists sympathetic to the Maoists.
Paris-based press watchdog Reporters Without Borders has alleged that Krishna Sen, the editor of a pro-leftist weekly who went missing in May, was killed in police custody. The government has denied any role in his disappearance.

We want immediate parliamentary elections. Restore power to the people,"" the peaceful crowd chanted in the heart of Katmandu.
The protest was organized by the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, the country's second-largest political party.
On Oct. 11, King Gyanendra fired Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister and replaced him with pro-monarchist Lokendra Bahadur Chand. The king said Deuba was incompetent and incapable of holding elections, that had been scheduled for Nov. 13.
Deuba had sought to postpone the elections, citing security threats by Maoist rebels.
Although the king has the authority to dismiss the elected government, critics say he went too far in firing Deuba and may have violated the constitution in appointing Chand.

Cheering crowds waved the red and white flag of the party as he said it would not accept a blow to democracy that was established in 1990 in this Himalayan kingdom.

Khadka, who was in Kathmandu at the time, was dispatched to the district to assess the damage and report back to parliament.
Another 49 policemen died in the attacks on police posts in Lamahi and farther southwest at Bhaluwang, officials said. Twelve rebels were confirmed dead.
Six civilians were also burnt to death when the Maoists stopped and torched a night bus heading towards Bardia, southwest of Dang district, a home ministry source said.
It was the deadliest assault by the Maoists since February, when they killed 128 policemen. The most devastating attack of the rebel campaign prompted Nepal's fractious parliament to prolong by three months a state of emergency imposed in late November.
Observers said the latest attacks marked a new strategy by the Maoists, who in the past have carried out hit-and-run raids on security forces and then disappeared into the bush.
But security sources said the Maoists were holding on to the police posts and had set up barriers on surrounding roads, apparently daring the army to strike back at them.
The rebels also set fire to some of the thick jungle to block helicopters from sending in reinforcements.
The attacks will likely put more pressure on Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who is fending off bids to oust him by rivals within his Nepali Congress party clamoring for tougher action.
Deuba took power in July and immediately reached a ceasefire with the rebels, who exercise de facto control over swathes of the impoverished countryside.
But three rounds of peace talks failed to reach a breakthrough, particularly over Maoist demands to abolish the monarchy. The rebels launched a spate of attacks on November 24, ending the truce and prompting the government for the first time to deploy the army against them.
Since then close to 1,200 people have been killed, on top of 1,800 who had already died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996.
At Satbaria post, which had been manned by around 100 armed policemen, some 1,000 rebels looted everything they could find, including automatic rifles, guns and ammunition, security sources said.
Officials said the rebels also looted a nearby bank and smashed a power station.
The officer in charge of Satbaria had asked for reinforcements during the battle, but helicopters have been obstructed by heavy rain around the kingdom.
The isolated country has received international assurances of support to battle the rebels, particularly from India, which by treaty is Nepal's chief supplier of military hardware.
Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya last week visited Washington, where he said US officials agreed in principle to provide military assistance to the government. A foreign ministry official said, however, that no concrete offer was made.
Secretary of State Colin Powell made a lightning visit to Nepal in January, where he backed the government's crackdown but stayed mum on how the United States might help.
The Maoist insurgency has devastated the already weak economy of Nepal, whose vital tourist trade was crippled last year after 10 members of the royal family were massacred by the drunken crown prince.

At least 13 anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot in Bardiya district while another 11 were killed in other districts, all located in the west part of the country, when they exchanged fires with government security forces on Saturday night, the press release said.
Meanwhile, the security forces also arrested nine anti- government guerrillas and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations across the country, the press release added.
More than 700 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on government security forces after they broke a four- month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 3, 000 lives, including policemen,guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

Economic losses jumped by nearly 60 percent over 2001, and global warming makes further increases in natural disasters and the damage they cause inevitable, Munich Re's survey said.
Flooding by the Elbe, Danube and other European rivers last August caused losses of some US$18.5 billion in ""the worst floods in Europe for centuries, probably since the millennium flood in August 1342,"" the survey said. Only US$3 billion of the flood damage was insured.
The worst human toll hit Afghanistan in May when more than 2,000 people were killed in a series of earthquakes in the Hindu Kush mountains. Summer flooding in Nepal, Bangladesh and India claimed some 1,200 lives, while about 1,100 people were killed in a heat wave in India.
Overall, US$11.5 billion of the year's natural disaster damage was covered by insurance companies - about the same amount as in 2001, Munich Re said.
But economic losses surged from US$35 billion in 2001 to some US$55 billion. Changes in the global environment will lead to more natural disasters in the future and ""losses will continue their sharp upward trend,"" Munich Re said.
""The evidence points to critical extreme wind speeds and precipitation being exceeded with increasing frequency, so for this reason alone there will inevitably be a stark increase in the loss burdens as well,"" Gerhard Berz, head of Munich Re's risks research department, said in a statement.
""2002 was, along with 1998, the warmest year since temperature readings began, and this is evidence of the still unbroken trend of global warming.""
Reinsurerers sell backup insurance to other insurance companies, spreading risk so that enormous losses from natural catastrophes can be covered. The companies make money both from premiums and from investing premium proceeds in stocks and bonds, so the drop in stock markets has hurt their profits.

The Alberta, Canada-based Light Up The World Foundation will split a $250,000 cash prize with the other four winners of the second annual Tech Museum Awards ceremony held Thursday night.
The awards, which are presented by the San Jose-based Tech Museum of Innovation and chip-equipment maker Applied Materials Inc., were established to encourage individuals, organizations and companies to implement technology to address global challenges.
""The heartwarming and inspiring stories of these remarkable people and organizations remind us of the potential goodness of technology,"" Tech Museum chief executive Peter Giles said.
The Light Up The World Foundation uses White Light Emitting Diodes to generate comfortable reading light that consumes only one-tenth of a watt of electricity and provides light for 10 years.
So far, the group has illuminated more than 500 homes in Nepal, 100 homes in India and 50 homes in Sri Lanka for $17,350.
Organizers estimate a third of the world's population relies on dirty, fuel-based lighting after nightfall. Wood fires and kerosene lamps not only provide poor lighting but also generate toxic fumes.
Diodes can be powered by solar panels, wind turbines and pedal generators. Thirty minutes of pedaling produces enough power for up to 20 hours of diode light.
Other winners include:
- The International SeaKeepers Society for equipping cruise ships, luxury yachts and other vessels with sensors to study the oceans and atmosphere. Data collected are transferred to scientists around the world by the Key Biscayne, Fla.-based group.
- Bunker Roy of The Barefoot College in Rajasthan, India for teaching practical technology skills, from solar power to rainwater harvesting systems, to India's rural poor.
- ApproTEC, based in San Francisco and Kenya, for developing an efficient, low-cost irrigation pump that allows rural farmers in Africa to increase production capacity.
- Andreas Pluckthun of the University of Zurich in Switzerland for pioneering technology to create synthetic, or recombinant, antibodies that might someday be used to proactively treat diseases.

""The anti-government rebels in Nepal are usurping the name of the leader of the Chinese people,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.
China supports Nepal's fight against the rebels and hopes for peace, stability and economic development for its Himalayan neighbor, Liu said.
The rebels, who want to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy, have waged a six-year armed struggle that has killed more than 4,000 people. They claim to follow Mao's version of communism, which emphasized peasant revolution.
Mao, who died in 1976, long advocated helping communist insurgencies around the world. However, his successors have abandoned global revolution in favor of economic development and consolidation of their one-party state.
Nepalese King Gyanendra is visiting China this week, in part to seek Chinese help against the rebels. China has not said whether it will provide material assistance to augment its moral support.
The sides on Wednesday also signed an agreement to boost trade across the border between Nepal and China's Tibet region.
Gyanendra's trip is his second visit to a foreign country since he was enthroned a year ago after the assassination of his elder brother, King Birendra, in a palace massacre committed by crown prince Dipendra, who died of wounds inflicted in the mayhem.
In a meeting with Gyanendra on Thursday at Zhongnanhai, the compound of the Chinese leadership, Premier Zhu Rongji said he had been ""greatly saddened"" by Birendra's death last year. Zhu said he went to Nepal's embassy to express condolences last year after the murders.

As the United States sought to defuse tensions between the nuclear-armed South Asian nations, Pakistan detained the founder of the outlawed Islamic militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which Indian officials linked to the attack that killed 35 people.
Hafiz Mohamad Saeed, the former leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba, or the Army of the Pure, was taken into custody Wednesday on suspicion he was planning to create unrest, official sources said in Pakistan.
Lashkar-e-Taiba is known for its suicide bombings and is also blamed by India for a December attack on its parliament that sent tensions on the subcontinent spiralling.
But Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani said that Pakistan had not done enough and lashed out at Washington for its support of President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism.
""It is unfortunate that when Pakistan has not renounced terrorism there are still some Western countries aiding Pakistan economically and in other ways,"" he told reporters.
""Whichever country uses terrorism as an instrument of national policy should not be helped by any country in the world,"" said Advani, who met later with US Ambassador Robert Blackwill.
The hawkish home minister also met with Defense Minister George Fernandes and Indian Kashmir's Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah. They were briefed by senior army commanders on their options.
""Pakistan is not going to stop this war that it has unleashed in India,"" said Abdullah, who has long called for strikes on militant camps across the disputed Kashmir border.
The home ministry said in a statement that a number of possible actions were discussed at the security meeting, including ""continued operations against the terrorists and action against the overground support base of the terrorists.""
The chief of India's army, General S. Padmanabhan, hinted he favored military action.
""I don't want to go into the specifics but time for action has come,"" Padmanabhan told the Star News television network during a visit to Nepal.
Parliament was due to discuss the attack Friday. The main opposition Congress party has pledged to support the government in action against terrorism.
""The government must not indulge only in sabre-rattling,"" Congress leader Sonia Gandhi said.
""It is high time it realised that Pakistan is an ally in the US-led war on terrorism. Therefore, India's problems are its own … we have to take strong action to deal with our own problems.""
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee also held a separate half-hour meeting Thursday with Fernandes, Advani and Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, officials said.
Singh cancelled a 12-day visit to Kenya, Tanzania and Mauritius due to rising tensions with Pakistan.
On Tuesday, militants disguised as soldiers opened fire on a civilian bus near Jammu, Kashmir's Hindu-majority winter capital, and killed seven passengers before storming the residential quarters of a nearby Indian army camp. Most of the 28 camp victims were women and children.
India's defense ministry identified the three attackers as Pakistanis from the central province of Punjab.
The names given by the ministry were similar to those given by a previously unknown rebel group called al-Mansoorain in a claim of responsibility to Kashmir media.
But Indian newspapers speculated al-Mansoorain could be a pseudonym for Lashkar-e-Taiba.
US President George W. Bush condemned the ""terrorist attack,"" which he said ""was also aimed at destroying opportunities for South Asia to build a future that is more stable, more peaceful, and more prosperous.""
India and Pakistan have massed about one million troops on their common borders since the parliament attack. New Delhi has ruled out any pullback.

Krishna Sen, editor of the weekly Janadisha, was arrested in May after the government accused him of writing articles in support of Maoist rebels, who have been fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy. The six-year insurgency has killed more than 3,500 people.
Paris-based media rights group Reporters Without Borders said last week that Sen had ""died under torture … in a detention center of the Nepalese security forces"" a week earlier.
It said authorities had returned Sen's body to his family for cremation without giving any details on the circumstances of his death.
Members of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists and human rights activists met officials of the National Human Rights Commission on Thursday and urged them to investigate the case, said Taranath Dahal, the federation's president.
The government has refused to comment. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has told reporters the government will make a statement, but did not specify when.
The government shut down Janadisha in November, after declaring emergency rule in response to the rebellion. Authorities said the newspaper was financed by the rebels and then arrested most of the journalists working there.
Nearly 100 Nepalese journalists have been detained without charge or arrested under the emergency rule, which restricts freedom of press and speech. About two dozen are still in custody.
""There are at least 10 journalists who have gone missing since they were picked up by security forces,"" Dahal said. ""We are asking the commission to pursue their cases too.""
Police say journalists have been arrested on suspicion of helping the rebels by publishing false stories intended to weaken security agencies.
Sen was detained for two years after publishing an interview with a rebel leader and was released in March 2001 on orders of the Supreme Court. He was detained again, under the emergency law, on May 20.

The Human Rights Organization of Nepal gave the names of four people they said were killed by the rebels for their affiliation with the ruling Nepali Congress party during the strike that ended Saturday.
The left-leaning rights group, which frequently accuses the government of excesses against the Maoists, also named two teachers it said the rebels snatched in the far eastern Taplejung district and released after chopping off their legs.
""During the five-day general strike, the Maoists indulged in crimes such as the killing of activists and the maiming of teachers,"" the group said in a report.
The rights organization also said the Maoists kidnapped two suspected govermment sympathizers in the northwestern Rukum district who remain missing.
The group said ""dozens"" of civilians were injured during the strike in bloody clashes between security forces and the Maoists, which are a daily occurrence in Nepal.
The Maoists called the five-day strike to pressure the government to resume talks, during which the rebels hope an agreement can be reached to abolish the monarchy.
But Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has refused to resume talks until the Maoists, who broke a four-month ceasefire in November, lay down their arms.
Around 3,200 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996, nearly half of them since the end of the ceasefire.

"329",2002174,"Title: Indian , Pakistani leaders meet informally at South Asian summit, troops remain on alert.rtf; Date: NA; Text: A brief meeting between the leaders of India and Pakistan failed to resolve a standoff between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Later Sunday, India said it downed a small, unmanned Pakistani spy aircraft.
The private meeting at a regional summit in Nepal was the first between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf since both countries put their armies on war alert last month.
The continuing tension was apparent Sunday night as the Indian military claimed to have shot down the drone after it intruded 2.5 miles into Indian air space over the disputed region of Kashmir. Pakistani officials immediately denied this, and the state-run news agency claimed the aircraft was India's own.
Indian defense analyst C. Uday Bhaskar said in New Delhi that he did not believe the downing of the aircraft would lead to war, but emotions remained high in Kashmir. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan province, which is claimed by both South Asian nations.
As they left for home after the two-day South Asian summit in Nepal, Vajpayee and Musharraf said neither their brief chat nor televised handshakes had eased tensions along the 1,100-mile border that divides their countries.
Later, in New Delhi, Vajpayee met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said Pakistan needs to condemn all types of terrorism to pave the way for negotiations. Blair was to meet with Musharraf on Monday.
""There must be a complete rejection of the types of terrorist actions carried out on the first of October and the 13th of December,"" Blair said, referring to attacks on the Jammu-Kashmir state legislature and the Indian Parliament, both blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
The Dec. 13 attack triggered the current standoff. Vajpayee said the militants were supported by Pakistan. Musharraf's government and the two militant groups have denied the charge.
When asked Sunday about his brief chat with Musharraf, Vajpayee said ""there was no talk of de-escalation."" He also said there were no plans for formal talks ""at the moment.""
Vajpayee said the meeting was a ""courtesy call"" and that ""there was no significant discussion.""
Musharraf told a news conference, ""We must remove the dangerous standoff between India and Pakistan,"" saying he hoped the weekend's interactions would continue on a formal basis.
Secretary of State Colin Powell called the foreign ministers of both countries Saturday night, Indian officials said, the same day Vajpayee refused to look at Musharraf or shake his hand at the end of the summit session after grudgingly accepting Musharraf's surprise offer of an on-camera handshake.
There was more contact on Sunday.
As the summit broke up, the foreign ministers of the two countries also chatted briefly with Vajpayee's national security adviser, discussing a handwritten note.
A Pakistani official told The Associated Press that it was an Indian ""wish list"" of demands for action against Pakistan-based Islamic militants who target India, and for the extradition of Indian criminals living in Pakistan.
Pakistani authorities have been announcing mass arrests of militants for the past two weeks, including the leaders and other members of two groups - Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed - that India accuses in the Parliament assault. Fourteen people were killed in the attack, including the five assailants.
Pakistani police said Sunday that security forces arrested 42 Muslim militants in a night-long sweep in eastern Punjab province, raising to 300 the number of detainees held in the crackdown.
The arrests have targeted groups opposed to Indian rule in two-thirds of Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority region; the rest of Kashmir is under Pakistani control. Musharraf's government calls the militants ""freedom fighters,"" a phrase repeated by Pakistani army spokesman Gen. Rashid Qureshi during the summit.
In Kashmir, at least one villager was killed and three were wounded on the Pakistani side of the border as border guards fired mortars and shells at one another Saturday night, police and witnesses said.
The Indian military said a Pakistani unmanned aircraft, which takes aerial photographs, was flying inside Indian territory along the border when troops shot it down Sunday.
Pakistani military officials said no Pakistani spy plane had been shot down and suggested the aircraft might have been a child's toy. Later, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported that ""an aerial vehicle of India crashed in the Jammu sector and the military officials of India are indulging in baseless propaganda to hide this loss.""
Heavy mortar and artillery shelling resumed after the reported downing of the drone, an Indian army official said.

The driver was trying to pass another vehicle when he lost control and the bus veered off the highway at Nagali Khola, about 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of Katmandu, the capital.
Shyam Gharti, a police official at the crash site who spoke to The Associated Press by phone, said it was unlikely there were survivors.
He said rescuers found the body of the driver and were looking for other victims in the Trishuli River, swollen by monsoon rains that have caused havoc in this Himalayan state.
The bus left Katmandu Wednesday but was forced to stop as workers cleared debris from a landslide that blocked the highway.
""The bus had been stalled for over 14 hours last night due to a landslide and the driver was probably in a hurry to finish the journey,"" Gharti said.
Earlier in the day, a small domestic airliner carrying foreign tourists crashed in bad weather near a popular trekking resort, killing all 18 people on board.
The impoverished Himalayan kingdom has been deluged by monsoon floods and landslides, killing nearly 500 people in the last month.

"332",20022805,"Title: New Zealander Edmund Hillary recalls conquest of Everest nearly 50 years ago.rtf; Date: NA; Text: When climbers scramble to the summit of the world's highest peak, their last obstacle is a 40-foot rock face covered in ice - the Hillary Step.
Before May 29, 1953, it had no name. Nobody had ever seen it up close, let alone scaled it.
But on that day, a 33-year-old New Zealand beekeeper and his Nepalese Sherpa guide cut a line of footholds into the icy wall and dragged their exhausted, oxygen-starved bodies the final feet to glory.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had become the first climbers to reach the 29,035-foot summit of Mount Everest.
Since then more than 1,000 people have climbed to the peak and the path blazed by Hillary and Tenzing is well worn.
On May 16, 54 people made it there - a record number for a single day. Among them was Tenzing Norgay's grandson, Tashi Wangchuk Tenzing - who first climbed it in 1997. Hillary's son, Peter, who scaled Everest in 1990, also is climbing the mountain.
Forty-nine years after his triumph, Hillary, now 82 and semiretired, recalls the endeavor was shrouded in doubt almost to the very end.
""It had really all been supposition. I didn't know whether we were going to be successful or not,"" Hillary said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I knew we were going to give it everything we had. But it wasn't until we climbed up the Hillary Step that I knew we were going to do it.""
They stood together on the summit's rounded dome. ""There was plenty of room for Tenzing and me,"" Hillary said. ""I had a very strong feeling of satisfaction that Tenzing and I had finally reached the summit when many had tried before unsuccessfully. And here we were.""
He talked in an office at his home in Auckland. A wall holds the wooden-handled, steel-headed ice ax he used - a tangible reminder not only of the feat itself, but of the difference in the equipment Hillary and Tenzing used and the high-tech gear carried by today's mountaineers.
Everest climbers now have ultralight, weatherproof clothes and boots and specially developed axes and ropes. Hillary and Tenzing had heavy woolen underclothes and trousers stuffed with feather down. They had soft leather boots and three pairs of gloves.
Hillary says he was the first to set foot on the summit, climbing ahead of Tenzing, who died in 1986. It doesn't seem to matter to him. Neither could have done it without the other, he says.
After picking their way up the Himalayan peak, a stoic Hillary stood in the clear, cold air at the top of the world and solemnly shook Tenzing's hand.
""But that wasn't enough (for Tenzing),"" Hillary said. ""He threw his arms around my shoulders. So I threw my arms around his shoulders, and we gave each other a hug.""
After the initial euphoria, Hillary began snapping photographs - mostly of Tenzing waving Nepalese and British flags - as proof they had reached their goal. There is no image of Hillary at the top.
""There are of course no photographs of me on the summit; however, I can assure you I was there,"" he said with a smile. ""Tenzing didn't have a camera … and the thought of getting him to take a photograph of me never really entered my mind.""
Hillary said he vividly remembers ""many occasions"" when he doubted the pair would reach the top. Deep ravines and crevasses, avalanches, extreme ice faces and rock walls stood in the way as they struggled upward.
""That's what it's all about really, overcoming those problems even though you may have a sense of fear. I think fear can be a stimulating factor and can help make you drive yourself really to overcome dangerous problems,"" he said.
Hillary has prospered on his achievement ever since. But each time he stands up as an after-dinner speaker, the impoverished Sherpa people of Nepal benefit.
For 40 years he has dedicated himself to raising money for them, providing schools, hospitals, airstrips, bridges and roads, even Buddhist monasteries. He's funneled about $500,000 a year for the 100,000 Sherpas.
Tenzing and Hillary agreed long ago they had no desire to climb Everest again.
""It's become a bit commercially orientated. I think we were the lucky ones way back in 1953,"" Hillary said.
He bemoans the arrival of tourist mountaineers who now crowd the peak during the climbing season every May.
""They pay $65,000 to be shuttled up the mountain,"" he said. ""We weren't doing it for any financial reason at all. These commercial expeditions nowadays are motivated by financial matters. I'm not happy with them and have never been, really.""
Too many people with too little experience have to be led up the mountain by their guides and watched carefully at all times, he said.
""Some of them succeed and some of them don't. Some of them live and some of them die,"" Hillary said.
Officials say 180 people have perished on Everest over the years.
Despite the changes in Everest endeavors, Hillary looks fondly on the peak.
""I still have pleasure in looking on the mountain and seeing a stream of cold ice flowing from the summit. I think I still have a feeling of sat"

Police said the small bombs exploded early in the morning in commercial areas in Kathmandu.
At least three other bombs were defused by security squads, witnesses said.
The blasts came ahead of a one-day general strike called for Monday by the Maoists to press their demand that a special assembly be convened to redraft the constitution.
The rebels are fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. Their ""people's war"" has left at least 4,700 people dead since its launch in 1996, according to official estimates.
The Maoists frequently call strikes in bids to show the support for their cause.
However, residents say the rebels have been ruthless in their attacks on anyone not obeying the strike, often attacking residents who dare to venture out or shopkeepers who do not down their shutters.
Security forces have appealed to transport companies to run as normal Monday despite the threat of violence.
Kathmandu has been rocked by nearly daily small bomb blasts since August 28, when a state of emergency was lifted. The emergency was imposed after the Maoists broke a ceasefire in November and had given authorities more leeway to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.

No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, which came hours before the government ended a state of emergency declared in November to battle Maoist insurgents.
Police blamed the rebels, who have been fighting to establish communist rule in Nepal since 1996.
The blast occurred nearly an hour before shops opened for business in the heart of Katmandu.
Fifteen minutes after the explosion, a warning was phoned in to state-run Royal Nepal Airlines that a bomb had been placed inside its headquarters, less than 330 feet from the mall. Hundreds of airline employees rushed from the office and army and police sealed off the area.
""We evacuated the building and no one will be let in for two hours as a precaution,"" said Ramagya Cahturbedi, the airline's chairman.
The mall blast came from explosives packed in a pressure cooker left inside a hallway on the building's third floor, a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
The explosion shattered shop windows and doors and damaged goods, police said.
""The explosion rocked the whole complex and we saw smoke coming from the area,"" said Narendra Shrestha, a manager at the shopping complex.
Rebels fighting to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong.
The conflict intensified after the failure of peace talks between the government and rebels in October.
The government says at least 3,290 rebels, 536 police officers, 658 civilians, 163 army soldiers and nine government workers have been killed by the fighting in the past six years.
The state of emergency, which was last extended by royal decree in May, was to expire Wednesday at midnight. The decision not to extend it again came ahead of parliamentary elections set for November.
The decree had suspended freedom of expression and assembly. It also had given soldiers and police the power to detain people suspected of supporting the rebels.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba promised in June that there would be no emergency rule during the polling to ensure free and fair voting.

"337",20022439,"Title: India - Pakistan crisis to be focus of regional summit in Nepal.rtf; Date: January 2, 2002 Wednesday; Text: The diplomatic focus on the crisis that has left India and Pakistan on the verge of war switched Wednesday to Nepal, amid hopes of bilateral talks to de-escalate tensions on the sidelines of a South Asia regional summit.
The long-delayed summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), due to open Friday in Kathmandu, comes less than a month after a deadly assault on India's parliament which New Delhi charges was carried out by Islamic militants at the behest of Pakistan's intelligence service.
The countries have massed troops along their border since the December 13 attack, but in recent days India has said it was encouraged by Pakistan's arrests of members of two groups it blames for the incident.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has publicly ruled out a meeting with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in Kathmandu, but India has since held out the possibility of some bilateral dialogue below the summit level.
SAARC foreign ministers, including India's Jaswant Singh and Pakistan's Abdul Sattar, were due to open a two-day meeting in Kathmandu on Wednesday, ahead of the summit talks.
While Pakistan is keen on a bilateral Singh-Sattar meeting, India has refused to commit to talks at any level.
Singh was non-committal on Tuesday when asked if he would initiate a dialogue with his Pakistani counterpart.
""I have no such confirmation to report to you,"" he told reporters.
Sattar told AFP in Kathmandu that there had been no Indian response to Islamabad's repeated offer of talks.
""There is no indication of any kind of meeting,"" Sattar said.
Analysts say India's reticence on the dialogue issue is founded on a desire to keep up the diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.
The United States, fearing an armed conflict between the South Asian nuclear rivals, has exerted significant pressure on Islamabad to crack down on Islamic extremist groups as demanded by New Delhi.
For India, dialogue is the carrot that ensures the international community continues to swing the stick over Pakistan.
The last time Musharraf and Vajpayee met was in July in the Taj Mahal city of Agra, when the talks deadlocked over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
The two sides have little common ground on Kashmir, with Pakistan demanding that India seek a political resolution to the separatist conflict in its only Muslim-majority state and New Delhi insisting that the real problem lies in Islamabad's support of Islamic militants waging a ""proxy war.""
In a New Year's message, however, Vajpayee appeared to take a more flexible approach.
""Shed your anti-India mentality and take effective steps to stop cross-border terrorism, and you will find India willing to walk more than half the distance to work closely with Pakistan to resolve, through dialogue, any issue, including the contentious issue of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he wrote.
But Vajpayee has been facing pressure from within his Hindu-nationalist BJP party to take tougher action -- perhaps even launch military strikes -- on Pakistani territory if Islamabad does not completely crack down on anti-Indian Islamic militants.
Musharraf, meanwhile, has already irritated hardline segments of the population by supporting the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan and leads a country where many passionately oppose Indian rule of Kashmir.

Pakistani troops targeted two posts with mortar fire in the southern Kashmiri district of Poonch late Thursday, to which the Indian army retaliated, defence sources said.
In the Samba region of Kashmir, 60 kilometres ( 38 miles) south of the Kashmiri winter capital Jammu on the international border, the Indian army fired mortar shells and damaged a Pakistani bunker.
Both sides exchanged small arms fire along several other points on the international border, the sources said.
Meanwhile, the number of soldiers killed in a suspected militant attack on an army convoy in Rajouri district on Thursday rose to four.
The soldiers were part of a ""road opening party"" which detects and clears explosive mines along the roads and highways in the region, he added.
In another incident, two Indian soldiers were injured in a blast in the southern district of Poonch on Friday when their vehicle ran over an explosive device.
The Indian army in two separate incidents killed seven foreign Islamic guerillas Friday in the Kashmiri frontier districts of Rajouri and Baramullah, a defence ministry spokesman said in Jammu.
The spokesman said three of the slain militants were from Jaish-e-Mohammad, one of the Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups India holds responsible for the attack on its parliament on December 13.
""The three militants were killed during our search for Gazi Baba in Baramullah,"" said the spokesman.
Gazi Baba is wanted by the Indian police for masterminding the attack on the Indian parliament.
The spokesman said four other foreign militants were killed in a gunbattle with Indian soldiers in Rajouri.
The army also seized 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of explosives from a militant hideout in the southern district of Doda.
Elsewhere in Kashmir, one Islamic militant was killed when Indian army soldiers acting on a tip-off cordoned off a house.
The militants inside the house opened fire on the soldiers and the encounter was still on, the sources said.
India and Pakistan have moved tens of thousands of troops to their border in recent weeks, following an increase in tension after the December 13 attack on India's parliament building in New Delhi.
India blamed the attack on two Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups who are battling New Delhi's rule in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf were to attend Friday the start of a summit of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Kathmandu.
India has ruled out any one-to-one dialogue between the two leaders during the summit, arguing that Pakistan must take further steps to crack down on Islamic militant groups before any formal bilateral dialogue can begin.

"339",20022395,"Title: Melting ice on Mount Everest is evidence of global warming_ climbers.rtf; Date: June 5, 2002 Wednesday; Text: The amount of ice on and around the world's highest mountain has declined spectacularly, providing startling evidence of the damage caused by global warming, a group of mountaineers returning from a special UN-backed expedition to the Himalayas said on Wednesday.
""Everywhere the impact of climate change was there to see, there is no doubt that the climate in the Himalayan ranges has become warmer and wetter,"" Roger Payne of the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA), said on returning from the region around Mount Everest in Nepal.
The expedition to the 6,189 metre (20,305 feet) high Island Peak, only eight kilometres (five miles) south of Mount Everest, was part of an attempt by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to mobilise climbers to make a practical contribution to observations on climate change.
Payne, who headed the group, said the mountain received its name from the first climbers to ascend the mountain in 1953 -- the same year as Sir Edmund Hilary conquered Everest -- because it stood out as a peak emerging from an island of ice.
""You go to that mountain now, you do not see it rising as an island in a sea of ice, you see rising out of an island of rubble,"" Payne told reporters.
Payne noted that a few ponds which used to surround Island Peak had grown into a two kilometre long, 100 metre (330 feet) deep lake.
Local people were also aware of the changes in recent years, Payne said, with many expressing concern about the lack of snow, shrinking glaciers and the growth of mountain lakes retained by fragile natural barriers.
The icefields that had helped Hilary and Sherpa Tensing on the first ascent of Everest have also shrunk, moving back by about six kilometres.
""Back in 1953 when Hilary and Tensing set off to climb Everest, they stepped out of base camp and straight onto the ice,"" Payne said.
Today, ""you would now have to walk for more than two hours to get onto the ice,"" he added.
The expedition of six climbers gathered their observations from comparisons with old photographs from the pioneering days of the conquest of the Himalayas and from accounts by local Nepalese.
At Thyangboceh Monastery, Lama Rinpoche, who has lived there for 30 years, told the group that he had witnessed two big floods caused by lakes that burst under the weight of water from melting glaciers, Payne said.
""It was the Lama's impression that such events were becoming more frequent and a growing phenomenon of the past eight to nine years, another member of the expedition, Ian McNaught-Davis said.
UNEP released a scientific study in April which found that lakes in Bhutan and Nepal were filling rapidly because of rising temperatures and melting glaciers.
It warned that they could burst their banks within a decade, sending walls of water crashing down into valleys.

Cabinet sources said Deuba spoke privately with General Prajjwala Shumshere Rana about his March 27 speech in which he blasted politicians for failing to counter a Maoist rebellion and accused some in power of using the chaos in the kingdom to ""grab power.""
Parliament opened two hours behind schedule Monday as Deuba also negotiated with opposition lawmakers who agreed to end a boycott of the house they began Friday to protest Rana's remarks.
Addressing parliament, Deuba cautiously rebuked Rana.
""The Royal Nepal Army is a non-political body so its members need to function keeping themselves aloof from politics,"" he said.
But he added: ""We are united in our support of the army to boost its morale.
""The security forces, including the royal army, are fighting not so easy a war against the terrorists, who are the enemy of the nation, democracy and the general public,"" Deuba said.
""They are engaged in this anti-terrorism war today with only a minimum of physical equipment with a sense of utmost devotion to defeating the terrorists.""
Deuba added he was ""fully confident"" the whole government was united behind multiparty democracy and the constitutional monarchy, which the Maoists are fighting to topple and replace with a communist republic.
Rana, addressing graduates last week at the army's Command and Staff College, dismissed criticism that the army had failed to deal a death blow to the Maoists and said Nepal had ""reached a critical point.""
""It is imperative to ask here, who led the country to this situation? Was this situation brought by the RNA (Royal Nepal Army) or misgovernment?"" he asked.
""How justifiable it is to blame the army for this unnatural situation brought by various political reasons in the last 12 years?""
The general said that beside Deuba and ""some young ministers who understand the security situation,"" many in government had not extended the needed support to the army.
Some 2,700 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996.
The army was not deployed against the rebels until November 2001, when they broke a four-month ceasefire with Deuba's government.

Santosh Pant, who lampoons politicians, civil society and the Maoists once a week on state television, had Saturday acknowledged he moonlighted for army intelligence.
The startling admission came after the Maoists, who are waging a bloody campaign to topple the monarchy, publicly accused the comedian of being a spy.
Pant refused to disclose what exactly he did for the army and in a statement Tuesday said only that he quit the intelligence post ""for family reasons.""
The Maoists last week warned Pant to leave the army immediately and apologize for a skit on his show that depicted the rebels raping young girls enlisted in their ""People's Liberation Army.""
""I regret if my serial has hurt anybody,"" Pant said. ""It was not my intention to hurt anyone.""
Roughly 30 percent of the Maoists' ragtag guerrilla force is female, according to women's rights groups. The Maoists have also embraced one cause of Nepalese women's activists by restricting alcohol in some areas under their control.
Pant's biting Friday-evening satire, ""Hijo Aaja Ka Kura,"" or ""Contemporary Issues,"" is one of the most popular shows on Nepal's normally staid state television.

The rebel attack in Sitalpati, about 250 miles west of the capital, Katmandu, began Thursday night and lasted into Friday morning.
The battle came a day after the army killed at least 48 rebels in the Achham and Doti districts, about 375 miles northwest of Katmandu.
Last weekend, rebels killed 137 police officers, soldiers and civilians in an attack on the Achham district headquarters and a nearby airport. It was the deadliest attack by Maoist rebels since their campaign to topple the constitutional monarchy began six years ago.
On Thursday, Nepal's parliament extended a state of emergency by three months as the rebels planned a nationwide strike to celebrate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency.
Most shops and businesses lowered their shutters in the capital in response to the rebel plan.
Buses and taxis stayed off the road. Some government and private vehicles ran their routes, but many government workers were forced to walk to their offices.
Police and army personnel patrolled capital streets to avoid any rebel strike.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba won the backing of his political opponents, who had demanded his resignation after the weekend rebel attack.
""The endorsement has united the entire Nepal against terrorists and terrorism,"" Deuba said after the legislature overwhelmingly approved his proposal to extend the emergency.
The insurgency has sapped government resources since it began in 1996 from remote mountains in Nepal, the Himalayan kingdom that is home to Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world.
More than 2,400 people have been killed since the rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, began fighting.
Analysts say the Maoist campaign has grown on fertile ground: this tiny nation has been beset by crushing poverty and a succession of weak elected governments after King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah gave up absolute monarchy in 1990. The adored monarch was killed last year by his son, then-Crown Prince Dipendra.
Eight other royal family members died in the palace massacre.
The state of emergency was imposed Nov. 26 after the rebels abruptly broke off peace talks and resumed fighting government forces. According to officials, some 550 guerrillas and 332 soldiers and police officers have been killed since then, and another 1,400 rebels arrested.
The prime minister promised that the drive to end terrorism would be backed by ""sweeping reforms in the social and economic areas by introducing anti-corruption programs and good governance.""
More than half the 23 million Nepalese live under subsistence levels and only a third are able to read or write. The government has channeled much of its limited resources to fight the insurgency and is pleading with international donors to help bail out the economy.
Opposition parties say force is not the answer to the rebellion.
""Patchwork solutions will not resolve the insurgency. There have to be reforms in social, economic and political areas,"" said Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the main opposition United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.
""I hope the government is serious about keeping … their promises,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the military campaign continued.
Defense Ministry spokesman Bhola Silwal said the army recovered the bodies of 48 rebels killed in an operation Wednesday in the districts of Achham and Doti. The rebels' weekend killings occurred in the same area.
The ministry said there were no casualties on the military side.
Earlier this month, suspected rebels set off two bombs in government tax offices in Katmandu, wounding at least 10 people.

"343",20021808,"Title: Needless deaths in Nepal 's crackdown on Maoists, Amnesty says.rtf; Date: March 20, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Nepal's security forces have deliberately shot dead Maoist rebels without trying to arrest them and have detained civilians solely because of their alleged sympathies for the insurgents, Amnesty International charged Wednesday.
The London-based human rights organization called on the government to ensure the army and police operate within the law during the crackdown on the Maoists and create a legal framework to ensure that detainees receive prompt court hearings.
""Journalists, academics, lawyers and human rights defenders have been arrested and detained for long periods of time simply because they are believed to be sympathetic to the Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist. They have not committed any criminal acts,"" Amnesty said.
Amnesty said some prisoners may have been tortured in custody, including a lawyer detained for his membership in a leftist-oriented forum and the editor of a weekly newspaper.
The Nepalese government declared a state of emergency on November 26, two days after the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with a string of attacks on the army and police.
Some 2,700 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their armed campaign to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996. About a third of the deaths have occurred since the end of the truce.
The rights body said in a statement it feared that among those killed since the state of emergency was imposed ""are scores of civilians and Maoists who were deliberately killed as an alternative to being taken prisoner.""
""The official version of of such killings is that people were 'killed in crossfire,""shot when trying to escape' or ""shot when running away,'"" it said.
""It is clear that there is a grave law and order threat to the country. However, in such a climate human rights must be protected with extra vigilance.""
Amnesty was also sharply critical of the Maoists, who it said have killed about 450 civilians considered to be ""enemies of the revolution"" and have carried out execution-style killings of police officers who had been wounded, taken prisoner or had surrendered.
The group said that from the launch of the Maoists' ""people war"" in February 1996 until the ceasefire in July, the rebels took hostage some 500 people, ""tortured scores of people taken captive, and imposed cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments.""
Amnesty said the Maoists have also recruited children as combatants.

""Our party is inviting all the political parties of Nepal within a week to discuss our planned national democratic reconciliation programme and move forward jointly to solve the current political crisis,"" NDP president and former premier Surya Bahadur Thapa said at a press conference.
""If this recourse is not taken to resolve its various social, economic and political problems, the country will sink in a deep quagmire of difficulties which are getting more complicated by the day,"" Thapa said.
The NDP has 11 seats in the 205-seat lower house of parliament.
Nepal has been under a state of emergency since November in order to combat at Maoist rebellion which has intensified in recent weeks. The Maoists have been fighting for a republic since 1996 and more than 2,300 people have died in the insurgency.
The country's economic growth during the current fiscal year, which ends in July 2002, is expected to be just half of the targeted six percent.
This is partly due to a slump in tourism as a result of the September 11 attacks in the US as well as the Maoist violence and adverse publicity surrounding the massacre of 10 members of the royal family in June.

"346",20021286,"Title: India frees top Kashmiri separatist leader.rtf; Date: November 11, 2002 Monday; Text: Kashmir's top separatist leader Yasin Malik was freed from prison Monday, eight months after he was arrested for allegedly laundering money to finance terrorism, a security official said Monday.
But news of the release, an attempt by the new Kashmir state government to ease tension in the region disputed by India and Pakistan, came as suspected Islamic militants set off a bomb along the main Kashmir highway, killing 13 paramilitary police and leaving at least five injured, officials said.
The men were traveling in a truck near the town of Ramsoo, about 150 kilometers south of Srinagar, when the bomb went off and threw the truck into a deep ditch, said Neeraj Kumar, spokesman for India's Border Security Force.
The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the largest guerrilla group in Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Malik, a former militant leader whose Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front is now a separatist political party, was flown Monday from the high security Kot Bhalwal prison outside Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, to the summer capital Srinagar. Malik confirmed his release in a brief phone call to The Associated Press.
The decision to release Malik, an icon to thousands of Kashmiri youths, came soon after the installation of a new government in Jammu-Kashmir, the heartland of a 12-year Islamic insurgency.
Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, the new state administrator, has promised to improve the government's image and to provide a ""healing touch"" to the violence-scarred region where more than 61,000 people have died since 1989.
Malik is one of the seven key decision-makers of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the main Kashmiri separatist alliance.
He was arrested in March on charges of smuggling US$100,000 to finance anti-Indian militants in the Kashmir Valley. Police officers stormed into a press conference he was giving in Srinagar and dragged him away.
His arrest came after police detained a woman traveling from Nepal carrying cash allegedly intended for him. Malik denied the allegation.
Malik, who suffers from a heart ailment, was granted bail in July, after a court was told that his health had deteriorated. But within moments, he was rearrested and booked under the Public Safety Act, under which he could be detained for two years without trial.
On Monday, police revoked the Public Safety charges, the security official said.
Malik's release was intended as a goodwill gesture by the state government, which is hoping to persuade the separatists to give up their campaign and end the violence.
Malik is among the most popular young leaders in Kashmir. His group led the first wave of young Kashmiris that took to the gun in the disputed Himalayan region in the late 1980s, sneaking across the border to Pakistan where former members say they received weapons training to return to fight Indian security forces.
Pakistan denies India's allegation that it provides arms and money to separatist guerillas.
In a separate incident, Ghulam Nabi Chuntsaz, an activist with the pro-India National Conference party, was shot dead Monday by unidentified gunmen outside the party's former office in downtown Srinagar, a police official there said on condition of anonymity.

The Defense Ministry said 56 policemen, four soldiers and three civilians were among those killed in clashes that broke out late Thursday, just hours after the government said it was working to start negotiations with rebels fighting to abolish Nepal's monarchy.
At least 55 rebels were killed, but that casualty figures was likely to go up as security forces were still looking for more bodies scattered or hidden in nearby jungles, it said.
The assault began in Khalanga, a town 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of Nepal's capital, Katmandu, just before midnight and continued until daybreak Friday.
The rebels blew up and burned government buildings, killing dozens of policemen, said an army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In the second attack, rebels swarmed a station in the northwestern town of Tarkokat, said a district official, also on the condition that he not be named.
The rebels rarely comment on their military operations and human rights groups seldom are able to reach battle sites to confirm government claims.
Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal said on Thursday that the government was working with human rights groups to establish contact with the rebels and start peace talks.
Though both sides have expressed willingness to talk, neither has made real progress toward negotiations and the military forces have continued their offensives.
""It is the Maoists who need to respond positively. Violence will not get them anywhere,"" Mandal said. ""The rebels need to agree to the talks and then we can set an agenda on what we need to discuss.""
On Wednesday, the leader of the rebels, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, repeated his offer to hold peace talks. He made the offer after a three-day nationwide strike ordered by the rebels.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began a violent campaign in 1996 to turn Nepal into a communist state.
The insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people, most of them after Nepal's king imposed a state of emergency in November 2001 and ordered the army to join the police in fighting the rebels.

A levee broke about 80 miles to the northwest near a huge chemical industry complex at Bitterfeld, prompting officials to order the evacuation of the town of 16,000. But authorities later revoked the order after the Mulde River began receding.
""The situation has calmed down,"" said emergency services official Reiner Jacob. ""The chemical park is not in danger at this time.""
In Dresden, the Elbe topped the 26 1/2-foot mark for the first time in more than 100 years, Mayor Ingolf Rossberg said. It was expected to rise another foot, close to the 29-foot level reached in 1845.
In South Asia, torrential rains pushed up water levels Thursday in rivers along the Himalayan foothills, where monsoon floods have killed nearly 900 people across India, Bangladesh and Nepal and displaced or trapped more than 25 million.
Chinese officials reported flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rains have killed 108 people over the past 10 days in the central Chinese province of Hunan. Those deaths raise to more than 900 the number of people reported killed by heavy rains this summer.
Even before Thursday's surge in Germany, floodwaters had damaged landmarks of Dresden, including the famed Semper Opera and Zwinger Gallery, where volunteers helped bring thousands of priceless masterworks to higher floors this week. The city's main train station is also waterlogged and has been closed for days.
Largely destroyed by a February 1945 Allied fire bombing near the end of World War II, rebuilt Dresden is one of Germany's top cultural attractions and tourist spots. Many of the landmarks are near the banks of the Elbe.
On Thursday, workers were pumping river water out of the Semper Opera's basement, where it had damaged stage equipment and costumes, said Christoph Bauch, the opera's chief of stage technology.
State officials said no damage to paintings at the Zwinger Gallery had been discovered so far after hundreds of masterworks were evacuated from storage in the basement. The gallery's upper floors were not touched by the floods.
About 170 intensive care patients were evacuated overnight from several Dresden hospitals and brought to other facilities. Some 3,000 residents were evacuated from newly flooded areas in the morning to gyms, schools and private homes.
The rising Elbe has been fed in part by high water on the Vltava - the river that devastated Prague over the past week.
On Thursday, Czechs crowded onto Prague's riverfront lookout points to watch the Vltava's muddy waters recede.
Generally clear skies over Germany on Thursday and a forecast of sunny weather promised relief here. But downstream from Dresden to the north, several cities on the Elbe - notably Magdeburg - braced for their share of flooding that has left 11 dead in Germany.
To the southeast in Europe, the rain-swollen Danube also raised alarms. The river was rising Thursday in Romania and in Hungary, where the Cabinet called an emergency meeting to review flood preparations. The river was expected to peak on Sunday in Budapest, the capital.
Slovakia declared a state of emergency in the capital, Bratislava, where authorities expect the Danube to reach crest Friday.
In Austria, where the floods left seven dead, the capital Vienna was spared major flooding as the Danube's water level receded.
In the town of Schwertberg, the raging Danube partially tore loose an 100-foot-long steel bridge Thursday. Authorities called for a special mountain crane to keep it from collapsing and being swept downstream.
Floodwaters swamped a breeding ground for flamingos at the zoo in Wels, triggering panic among hundreds of birds and forcing zookeepers to move eggs from nests to higher ground.
""The flamingo parents were nervous wrecks, but it was our only chance,"" zookeeper Daniela Artmann told the Austria Press Agency on Thursday.
But floodwaters continued to subside in most of Austria's hardest-hit areas Thursday, and emergency personnel began shifting from sandbagging operations to mopping up.
In Prague, thousands of sandbags kept the raging Vltava from punching through and flooding the historic Czech capital's quaint Old Town. Officials said the Vltava dropped 3 feet overnight, but many parts of the city remained under water.
Hundreds of thousands of Czechs fled the rushing waves of the Vltava and dozens of other rivers, searching for higher ground. About 70,000 inhabitants of the capital's 1 million people left their homes, city officials said.

Deuba's breakaway faction will be called Nepali Congress (Democratic) on ballots during parliamentary elections in November, said Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka.
Deuba supporters had applied for a new party name and symbol on Monday after the Election Commission last week rejected the prime minister's claim to be the leader of the ruling Nepali Congress party.
Led by Girija Prasad Koirala, a former prime minister and Deuba rival, the party has won most of the elections since democracy was restored to Nepal in 1990.
The prime minister's bid for leadership of the ruling party follows an intra-party struggle over his attempt to extend a state of emergency declared last year as part of government's efforts to intensify a campaign against Maoist rebels.
When he failed to gain enough support for a six-month extension of the emergency, Deuba asked Nepal's King Gyanendra to dissolve Parliament and call elections.
That decision was also opposed by the faction loyal to Koirala, and prompted Deuba's expulsion from the party.
Deuba remains prime minister until the election.

Zee Television said a bomb concealed in a parked two-wheeler scooter exploded in the busy Sarurnagar area near Hyderabad, the state capital of Andhra Pradesh state, where Maoist guerrillas have stepped up bloody attacks.
So far neither the state's dominant People's War Group (PWG) or any other Maoist organisation have claimed responsibility for the explosion.
The blast occurred two days after the PWG claimed responsibility for a bus blast on Monday that killed 14 people.
In that attack the guerrillas apparently believed the state transport corporation bus was carrying policemen but the majority of the victims were local tribespeople returning to their village after visiting a local fair.
Police said they thought the rebels blew up the bus to avenge the killing of five of their cadres by security personnel on Sunday.
The PWG is one of India's oldest and most violent Maoist insurgent groups and although it is banned under the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, it has a sizeable following in Andhra Pradesh.
The rebels have been fighting a three-decade battle for greater social and land rights for the state's indigenous tribal population and landless farmers, in a conflict that has cost more than 10,000 lives.
In September, Andhra Pradesh state Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu ruled out any new ceasefire with the PWG, saying it would only strengthen the rebels.
Nepal has alleged that the PWG and other far-left Indian groups have ties to Maoist rebels waging a ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy in the kingdom.
The conflict has claimed 7,200 lives in Nepal since 1996, according to official figures.

""There is a considerable drop in the cross-border terrorism, but deployment on the border will continue while cross-border terrorism is there."" Fernandes told the media here in an assessment of the current situation following sighs that New Delhi and Islamabad had moved towards easing of tension along the border.
As part of stepped up anti-infiltration measures in Kashmir, New Delhi had agreed in principle on an American suggestion to place ground sensors along the line of control in Kashmir, Fernandes announced at the function to mark the Indian army's successful expedition to 8091-meter-high Annapurna, one of the main peaks in Nepal.
During his visit to New Delhi earlier this month, United State Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested that India should import the sensors from the United States and place them along the border with Pakistan.
However, Fernandes said no formal talks had yet begun with Washington on the equipment.
Indian Army chief S. Padmanabhan, who was also present at the function, echoed Fernandes, admitting that the level of infiltration into India-controlled Kashmir from across the line of control had come down.
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the Indian defense establishment ruled out any military-to-military dialogue or any immediate joint patrolling on the border on the ground that "" confidence and trust between the two armies was still low.""
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee suggested early this month that Indian and Pakistan should jointly patrol the line of control as a measure to check and contain what India claimed as cross-border infiltrations.
The Indian Express daily reported on Wednesday that India and Pakistan could take their most significant confidence-building measure soon through military talks towards de-escalation of tension along the border.
In an exclusive interview to the Express correspondent Jyoti Malhotra on Tuesday, Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said that ""when the need arises, the two militaries can engage in dialogue through existing established channels so that the de-escalation process is properly handled.""
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee also said in an interview with a local medium last weekend that there could be military-level talks between the two countries to control infiltration from across the border and the line of control in Kashmir.
New Delhi has stated very clearly that it would not withdraw its troops from the border before the scheduled elections in India- controlled Kashmir in October, but it could take steps towards de- escalation, including pulling back of its forces to peacetime locations and de-alerting its air force.
Under close watch of the international community over the developing situation between the two countries, both India and Pakistan began taking certain measures to reduce tension along their border towards the end of last month.
India has insisted that resumption of dialogue with Pakistan was only possible after Islamabad ""completely"" stops what it called cross-border terrorism against India and clamps down on terrorist camps allegedly based in Pakistan.
Sources here said that the two neighbors would have to go a long way to reach a solution of the Kashmir dispute, which has been the main cause for tension and even wars between India and Pakistan.

This was the biggest-ever attack by the KLF, which is a relatively new group fighting for autonomy for tribespeople in the Khumbuwan area to the east of Mount Everest.
They attacked the plant in the eastern Bhojpur district, which provided electricity to 1,600 families in the area, on Saturday.

The disciplinary committee of the Nepali Congress decided Deuba's membership would be suspended until he justifies the holding of elections two years ahead of schedule, said a member of the executive committee, C.P. Bastola.
""A suspension letter was delivered to Deuba on Thursday afternoon giving him three days notice to explain why parliament was dissolved without the party's consent,"" Bastola told AFP.
""He has not been expelled,"" he said.
Meanwhile Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala, Deuba's predecessor as prime minister and his arch-rival, has asked all cabinet ministers to resign within three days, state television said.
Three ministers resigned earlier Thursday from the cabinet, saying Deuba had not consulted with party colleagues before recommending the move to King Gyanendra.
Sources in the party said other action may be taken against Deuba after the return to Nepal later this week of the Nepali Congress's respected former leader, K.P. Bhattarai, who is undergoing medical treatment in London.
The suspension is not expected to affect Deuba's position as caretaker head of government.
Gyanendra late Wednesday disbanded parliament and called elections two years ahead of schedule as parliament looked set to reject an extension to emergency rule.
The emergency had been imposed in late November to counter Maoist rebels after they broke a four-month ceasefire initiated by Deuba.

"360",20021934,"Title: State use of antipersonnel mines on the decrease, campaigners say.rtf; Date: September 12, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nine governments are known to have used anti-personnel mines from May last year to mid-2002, down from at least 13 in the previous year, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) said on Friday.
But the organisation condemned the continued extensive use of the devices, singling out India and Pakistan, saying that both had engaged in ""massive new mine-laying operations"" along their common border since December 2001.
Anti-personnel mines have also continued to be used extensively by the governments of Myanmar and Russia -- the latter in Chechnya -- and to a lesser extent in Nepal, Somalia and Georgia, ICBL said.
Releasing its annual Landmine Monitor Report for 2002, ICBL painted a mixed picture of efforts to eradicate the devices five years after the Mine Ban Treaty was first signed in Ottawa, Canada.
""Perhaps the most encouraging development noted in this report is the decrease in the number of governments and rebel groups using anti-personnel mines,"" ICBL Ambassador Jody Williams said in a statement.
Two of the nine governments -- Angola and Sri Lanka -- stopped using anti-personnel mines in 2002 when ceasefires were declared, and have not started using them again, the group said.
Along the border between Pakistan and India, which have not signed the 1997 treaty, the laying of landmines was ""possibly the biggest anywhere in the world in decades, resulting in numerous civilian casualties"", it said.
""These operations likely mean that more mines went into the ground globally than in the previous reporting period,"" said ICBL, which together with Williams was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.
Seven million stockpiled antipersonnel mines were destroyed in the reporting period from May 2001 to mid-2002, and the number of countries producing the devices has dropped to 14, the report said.
Turning to Afghanistan, the ICBL said there were reports of limited use of mines and booby-traps by Taliban, al-Qaeda fighters and the Northern Alliance.
""There were no instances of use of antipersonnel mines by the United States or coalition forces,"" it added.
But Iran which imposed an export moratorium on the devices in 1997 has provided mines to fighters in Afghanistan and elsewhere, it said.
And Tajikistan, which is party to the treaty, has failed to meet treaty requirements such as submitting transparency reports, the ICBL noted.
The 922-page document, the fourth annual report compiled by the ICBL, is to be presented to diplomats attending a five-day meeting here of states parties to the Mine Ban Treaty in Geneva from Monday.

A group of about 100 rebels attacked the station Monday night at Dumkibas, a town about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of the capital, Katmandu.
Thirty-one officers were at the station at the time of the attack and most of them were still missing and believed to be hiding in nearby jungles, police official Krishna Bahadur Rana said.
The rebels had blocked a highway with trees and rocks, which slowed rescue efforts.
More than 5,000 people have died during the six-year Maoist insurgency, half of them since King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency in November and ordered the army to join the police in fighting the rebels.
The emergency, which restricted freedom of speech, press and assembly, was imposed last November after the rebels withdrew from peace talks. The emergency was lifted in August, but the military has continued its offensive.

"362",20022820,"Title: Nepal 's King Wants End to Rebellion.rtf; Date: June 5, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Wrapping up his first year on the throne he took after Nepal's royal family was massacred, King Gyanendra called for unity as the country's military battles Maoist insurgents.
""We should have the attitude of doing something for peace, development and good governance and take pride in being Nepalese and remaining Nepalese,"" the king said in an interview published Wednesday by the state news agency.
Thursday marks Gyanendra's first anniversary as Nepal's mostly ceremonial monarch, and there was no indication he would lift the emergency rule that has suspended civil liberties for Nepalese as the government seeks to crush the revolt.
Gyanendra's brother, the beloved King Birendra, was killed by Crown Prince Dipendra on June 1, 2001, in a massacre that left 10 royals dead, including Dipendra, who ended the palace blood bath by turning a gun on himself.
Many ordinary Nepalese refused at first to believe that Dipendra would kill his family. Gyanendra was not widely liked after he was crowned, although Nepalese have now grown to accept him.
""Our country, which in the past has remained a synonym for peace, is choking in a spate of violence, terror and destruction,"" the king said. ""We are still trying to find the underlying causes and will reach a constitutional resolution to the problem.""
Since Gyanendra was crowned, fighting between the rebels and government troops has intensified. The king approved emergency rule in November, after the Maoists broke a cease-fire, and has ordered the army to fight back.
The rebels are trying to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy, which gives an elected prime minister the power over day-to-day governance. The king stays out of politics and is largely a figurehead - when he declared emergency rule it was at the request of the government.
The rebels have refused the government's offer to bring them into the mainstream of Nepalese politics and end the violence.
More than 3,500 people have died in the fighting, mostly in the past six months. The rebels want to install a communist government, and they draw their inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong.
The king was asked what might finally stop the violence.
""If all concerned work sincerely and with dedication to understand the problems and hardship of the people and bring to them the fruits of democracy, the nation could move ahead,"" he said.
Under emergency rule, the government suspended a provision in the constitution that protects the freedom of opinion and expression, and the freedom to assemble peacefully. It also suspended the constitutional guarantee against prior restraint of news articles.
Authorities are also allowed to keep people locked up under ""preventive detention"" even though they have not been charged with any crimes.
Gyanendra also dissolved the parliament and ordered fresh elections on Nov. 13 at the request of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
Many have feared the government will not be able to hold the elections due to attacks by the rebels in mountainous areas, but the king said he expects the voting to take place.

The report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan listed 23 parties that recruit and use child warriors in violation of internationally accepted standards.
""Those who violate the standards cannot do so with impunity,"" the report said, but stressed ""more needs to be done"" to stop the practice.
Rebel groups in Burundi, Congo, Liberia and Somalia, as well as factions in Afghanistan still recruit and use child warriors, according to the list, which was part of Annan's third report on children and armed conflict.
The list was limited to conflicts currently on the Security Council's agenda, but it said children have also been recruited for combat in Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Sudan, northern Uganda and Sri Lanka.
Demobilization and reintegration programs for child combatants are under way in recently ended conflicts in Angola, Kosovo, the Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, the report said.
Remnants of the hard-line Taliban and factions associated with the former Northern Alliance and in the south of the country were singled out for drawing children into war. Northern alliance troops were U.S. allies in the war on terror in Afghanistan.
""Following the fall of the Taliban government, there was significant demobilization of soldiers, including children,"" the report said. ""However, recent reports indicate that some armed groups have resumed recruitment … including underage boys.""
The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers last year estimated that more than 300,000 children were fighting as soldiers in 41 countries.
The London-based group said the children, including about 120,000 in African armies, were used as front-line fighters, minesweepers, spies, porters and sex slaves.
""We … see this report as a solid foundation for acting to end this shameful practice,"" said coalition coordinator Casey Kelso. ""The challenge to the Security Council is to demand accountability and take action to stop children being used as soldiers.""
The report cited progress in protecting children during conflict, including three Security Council resolutions and two landmark international treaties setting age limits.
International law prohibits recruiting children under the age of 15, while several United Nations conventions condemn the practice of having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier.
""For the first time in an official report by the secretary-general, parties in conflict which continue to recruit and use child soldiers are named and listed,"" said Olara Otunnu, Annan's special representative for children and armed conflict.
U.N. officials and activists said they hoped the list would send an important message and help move the international community from words to action.

"364",20021684,"Title: Cabinet backs PM over early elections in Nepal.rtf; Date: May 24, 2002 Friday; Text: Nepal's beleaguered caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba got the backing of his remaining 34 cabinet members Friday over his controversial decision to call early elections.
Deuba was Thursday suspended by his own Nepali Congress (NC) party over his surprise decision to dissolve parliament and call polls two years early, after the legislature had seemed poised to end a state of emergency.
The abrupt move has been attacked from across the political spectrum and the NC president, Girija Prasad Koirala, Thursday urged all ministers to resign within three days.
Three of them did, including Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, and their resignations were accepted by the king Friday.
But the remaining 34 threw their weight behind Deuba and his call for the anti-Maoist emergency to be prolonged.
""Of the 34 ministers, Minister for Agriculture Mahesh Acharya is currently visiting India so he has yet to sign the joint statement showing his support to Deuba,"" a cabinet source said.
But the source added: ""We have received a call from Acharya and he has expressed his support to the prime minister.""
King Gyanendra, on Deuba's advice, disbanded parliament late Wednesday as it seemed set to reject a six-month extension of the emergency rule.
In a joint statement, the cabinet ministers blamed Koirala, the former prime minister and Deuba's arch-rival, for creating divisions within the party.
The statement said the state of emergency was crucial to Nepal's stability after months of bloody clashes between government forces and the ultra-leftist Maoists, who want to overthrow the monarchy.
""In view of the imperative need to safeguard the nation as well as public life and property, the prime minister has no alternative but to seek a fresh mandate from the people to achieve these goals.""
Koirala wants to expel Deuba from the party over the issue, the ministers said.
In an address on national television late Friday, Deuba defended his decision to dissolve parliament and pledged to hold free and fair elections in November
""The Maoist terrorists are killing and looting the innocent people and bombing the hostels and educational institutions of orphans,"" he said.
""There was no alternative but to dissolve parliament and seek a fresh mandate from the people through elections.""
Three lawyers have appealed to the supreme court to overturn Deuba's decision, court sources said.
They claim the dissolution of parliament was ""unconstitutional and prejudicial"" since there was a possibility of forming an alternative government within the disbanded parliament without fresh elections. The court will look into the petition next week.
There is a precedent for the court to reinstate a disbanded parliament. In 1995 then prime minister Manmohan Adhikari, who headed a minority Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) government, dissolved parliament ahead of a no-confidence motion against him.
The court decided that parliament should be reinstated as a coalition government could be formed by opposition parties.
But Deuba supporters say the current situation is different as the government did not face a no-confidence motion and had a majority in parliament.
At the last polls in May 1999, the NC secured 113 seats in the 205-member parliament. The second-biggest party was the NCP-UML with 69 MPs.
The next election, originally due in 2004, is now to be held on November 13.
The Maoist rebellion has cost more than 4,000 lives since 1996 -- more than half of them since the guerrillas broke a truce in November last year, prompting the emergency.
The emergency gives local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists and impose curfews, measures Deuba's rivals say are draconian and which have not stopped the rebels.

Five soldiers and 10 civilians were also killed, a cabinet source said.
Army officials said the fierce fighting took place overnight in Khara village in Rukum, 320 kilometres (198 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, but could not confirm the number of casualties.
The violence came as King Gyanendra Monday night extended by three months a state of emergency imposed to tackle the Maoist insurgency -- after it expired at midnight on Saturday.
The emergency was first introduced in November last year after the guerrillas broke a four month ceasefire and pulled out of peace talks.
It gives local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists and impose curfews, measures critics say are draconian and which have not stopped the rebels.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed over 4,000 lives, with half the deaths coming in recent months.
The extension of the emergency has split the ruling Nepali Congress party, with caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Sunday being expelled for his decision to dissolve parliament and call elections two years early.
He apparently asked the king last week to dissolve the 205-member lower house of parliament and call elections for November 13 after his own party refused to back him over extending the emergency.

The guerrillas were gunned down on the spot by the government security forces in a fighting lasted from Sunday night to early Monday morning, when a group of guerrillas attacked the Rumjhatar airport in the eastern district of Okhaldhunga, about 150 kilometers east of Kathmandu, the press release said.
As many as 16 bodies of the guerrillas have been found so far and it is estimated that the guerrillas have suffered a lot, the press release noted, adding that one army officer and a soldier were killed in the fighting.
The security forces have launched a mopping-up operation in the district and recovered a large amount of arms and weapons.
More than 3,700 guerrillas and hundreds of security personnel have been killed since the government imposed a state of emergency on Nov. 26 last year following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces. The guerrillas broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on Nov. 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas in August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency. The insurgency has claimed   more than 5,000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas and civilians since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.
The anti-government insurgents have stepped up their violent activities across the Himalayan kingdom since the nine-month-long nationwide state of emergency expired at the end of August.

The tragedies came as the poor Himalayan nation struggles with annual monsoon rains that have killed more than 500 people since June.
On Friday, authorities at the Teaching Hospital in the capital Katmandu released to relatives the bodies of the three Nepali crew of the ill-fated plane, but were awaiting instructions on the bodies of the other victims - 15 foreign tourists.
The tourists killed in Thursday's crash comprised 13 Germans, one American and one Briton. An official at the German Embassy in Katmandu said they were waiting for a word from Berlin on what do with the bodies.
The Canadian-built Twin Otter - owned by private domestic carrier Shangri-La Air - had slammed into a hillside as it approached the western resort town of Pokhara, killing everyone on board. The flight was from Jomson, a popular trekking spot and Hindu religious site. The bodies were flown to Katmandu on Thursday night.
In the remote village of Thapra in eastern Nepal, where a landslide is feared to have killed 65 people, soldiers and police officers used shovels and picks to dig through debris searching for bodies, a government official said Friday. No body count was yet available.
Trilok Prasad Shrestha, chief official of Ramechap district where the village is located, told The Associated Press rescuers were ""working round the clock."" Survivors have been moved to safer villages nearby, he said.
""The village is located in a gorge which may not be entirely safe at the moment,"" Shrestha said.
The landslide struck Wednesday and initial reports said 40 houses had been destroyed. But rescuers only reached there Thursday as Thapra is only accessible on foot through mountain trails or by helicopter.
A Russian-built MI-16 cargo helicopter, carrying rescue workers and relief material, had been unable to fly to the site of the disaster earlier due to incessant rain and dense fog.
Authorities had earlier announced that they were wrapping up efforts to rescue victims of other weather-related disasters as conditions were improving.
Monsoon floods and landslides have also caused havoc in other parts of South Asia - including neighboring India and the low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh.
More than 1,000 people have died in the region and more than 25 million have been displaced since June. At least 512 people have been killed in Nepal alone.
Also Friday, rescue workers recovered the body of the driver of a bus that fell into a rain-swollen river with 45 people on board the previous day. A local police official said rescuers have been unable to recover the bus or more bodies from swirling waters of Trishul River and all the passengers are feared dead.
The driver was trying to pass another vehicle when he lost control and the bus veered off the road at Nagali Khola, about 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Katmandu, said Sham Gharti by telephone.

Meanwhile in central India, a 125-year-old dam burst killing 10 people and forcing 10,000 others to flee their homes, officials and news reports said Wednesday.
Villagers were shifted to relief camps Tuesday after a 5-meter (16 feet) crack emerged in the wall of the dam in the state of Madhya Pradesh, the area's administrator Rajesh Rajaura said. The stone wall collapsed hours later.
Most of the residents of the Nepalese village of Thapra in Ramechap district were asleep when the landslide struck early Wednesday, said Lekhnath Pokhrel of the Natural Calamity Management Center.
""Initial reports said that 40 houses were swept away and at least 65 people are reported to be missing and feared killed,"" Pokhrel said.
He said helicopters loaded with relief material and rescuers were waiting at the Katmandu airport for the weather to clear so they could fly to the village, but low visibility and poor light forced rescue efforts to be postponed until Thursday.
The village, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital, Katmandu, is in a remote mountainous area with no roads to nearby towns. People use mountain trails to reach it.
The Himalayan kingdom has been badly hit by annual floods that have devastated large areas of South Asia. More than 25 million people have been displaced or stranded in Nepal, India and Bangladesh since June.
Nearly 500 people have been killed in Nepal and 250,000 left homeless by landslides and floods since the heavy monsoon downpours began. Most have occurred in remote mountainous areas accessible only by helicopter. Other areas have been cut off as torrential rains have washed away roads.
At least five people were killed in Nepal over the weekend when two houses collapsed in two villages near Katmandu.
In India, at least 10 more people died Tuesday, six of them from waterborne diseases, in the rain-soaked eastern state of Bihar, officials said Wednesday. The deaths raised the statewide toll to 327.
Doctors in more than 475 temporary medical centers in the worst-hit Samastipur, Madhubani, Sitamarhi and Sheohar districts were distributing water purification and anti-diarrheal tablets to stranded villagers, said A.C. Pandey, a relief and rehabilitation department official.
The Bagmati, Kosi and Gandak rivers were beginning to recede, though they were still flowing above the danger mark, Pandey said.
The state government was distributing grain and lentils at more than 650 relief centers to villagers stranded on the roofs of their homes or camping along highways and embankments.
But there appeared to be no immediate relief in sight for the 16 million people hit by the floods in Bihar, with the Central Water Commission on Wednesday forecasting moderate rain over the next 24 hours.
Another 39 people have died in India's northeastern state of Assam.
In Bangladesh, a small girl was killed and five others injured when a mud house collapsed after overnight rain in the southwestern Khulna district, putting the death toll in the country to 158.

Trying to avert a fourth war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday he would invite Pakistan's President Gen. Pervez Musharraf and India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to meet together.
Russia sent Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Safonov to Pakistan on Monday to discuss the offer and Pakistan reacted positively, state-run Pakistan Television said.
Pakistan says it will meet ""anytime, anywhere"" with India's leaders to discuss their five-decade dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim in its entirety.
India has said there will be no high-level meetings with Pakistan until there is a noticeable, and verifiable, end to cross-border infiltration by militants carrying out attacks in India, particularly in its portion of Kashmir. India demands that Pakistan shut down the militants' camps in Pakistan's portion of Kashmir.
""India has never stood against a dialogue,"" Singh said. ""You have to create a climate that is conducive to dialogue. You cannot put a pistol of terrorism to my temple with the finger on the trigger and say, 'Dialogue with me or I will release this trigger of terrorism.""'
Musharraf said on Monday that infiltration is no longer occurring.

The two countries have been on war alert since December.
At a January meeting of South Asian nations in Nepal, Musharraf walked off the stage after giving a speech, to publicly shake the hand of Vajpayee.
The Indian prime minister had earlier snubbed Musharraf and refused to have any one-on-one meetings. At the end of the conference they shook hands again on stage, but there were no private chats.

""If they want to prove themselves - that they are sincere for a peaceful solution - they have to renounce violence and lay down their arms,"" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said in an interview Thursday.
Otherwise, he said, the military campaign against the rebels will continue.
A signed statement by the rebel commander, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known as Prachant, was faxed to news media and government offices on Thursday, saying a cease-fire could begin next Wednesday, but that the government must reciprocate.
Deuba said that he initiated a dialogue with the Maoists when he became prime minister but after three rounds of talks, they started a boycott and attacked many army barracks and police headquarters and looted many banks.
During previous cease-fires, he said, ""They have been able to regroup their cadres and rank and file, and they've been able to strengthen their position to attack. Therefore, I can't trust them any more. By announcing a cease-fire, they may regroup again so that they might attack again.""
""They are not sincere. They are not serious. They are not honest. They are terrorists. If they are not terrorists, then they should lay down their arms and renounce violence and then we can talk to them,"" Deuba said.
He accused the Maoists of using ""terror tactics"" to try to destroy Nepal's democracy and said they were financed by ""international terrorist organizations"" that want to take over the Himalayan kingdom.

The guerrillas, fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy and to redistribute land to the poor, withdrew from a western stronghold after overrunning it Tuesday night and killing at least 100 government forces.
State-run radio said some 250 rebels were killed in the most intense fighting of the war at the remote village of Gam, where the Maoist rebellion began.
Deuba said ""nobody knows"" what the actual death count is because the terrain is very difficult and the weather isn't good so it's difficult to verify the reports. But he said ""the casualties to the Maoist side are much higher.""
Asked the size of the rebel movement, he said, ""There could be 2,000, maybe 3,000 hard core."" But he said the rebels use women and children as human shields in attacks on military installations.
Deuba came to New York to attend the U.N. children's summit after talks in Washington with President George W. Bush and congressional leaders. He is flying to London on Saturday and expects to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
""There's tremendous goodwill in the White House, the Senate and Congress toward Nepal's campaign against terrorism,"" he said.
Deuba said Bush ""assured me"" that the United States will assist Nepal in combating terrorism and discussions are under way on the type of assistance.
""I requested him to help equip our security force, our military force, and to help alleviate poverty,"" he said.

"375",20022120,"Title: Schools closed around Nepal by Maoist strike.rtf; Date: October 1, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Schools were closed around Nepal Tuesday as a student union affiliated with Maoist rebels called a two-day strike to push for free education and other demands.
Administrators said they closed down all schools, including universities, to prevent any potential attacks by Maoists on institutions that remained open.
A private school in the capital Kathmandu was bombed on Sunday, causing damage but no injuries. Officials said they considered the attack an apparent warning to schools to close down Tuesday and Wednesday.
Suspected Maoists last week also bombed a private school in Bansbari on Kathmandu's outskirts, damaging six school buses and the administrative office.
The All Nepal National Free Students Union (Revolutionary) called the strike to press the government on 13 demands, including free education at all schools across the kingdom and an end to a crackdown on teachers who do not have government accreditation.
Nepal recently said it would suspend uncertified teachers after reports that thousands of educators may have fake credentials.
The student group is also demanding a ban on Indian teachers and instruction in Hinduism's holy language Sanskrit, which is generally associated with higher castes.
The Maoists are staunchly anti-Indian, accusing the giant neighbor of trying to control Nepal's political, economic and cultural affairs.
The students are also demanding an end to the ""commercialization"" of Nepal's schools, claiming that administrators are reaping huge profits on education.
Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 in a rebellion that has claimed more than 4,900 lives.
Some two-thirds of the deaths have been reported since the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with the government in November 2001, prompting King Gyanendra to deploy the army against the guerrillas for the first time.

"376",20021743,"Title: Nepal 's king fires prime minister _ first time since end of absolute monarchy.rtf; Date: October 4, 2002 Friday; Text: Nepal's king fired the prime minister and disbanded his Cabinet - the first time since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1990 that a Nepalese king has ousted an elected government and its leader.
King Gyanendra's announcement, made over state-run Radio Nepal Friday, came a day after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba asked the monarch to postpone November's parliamentary elections by one year because of concerns about attacks by rebels.
""I have decided to relieve incompetent Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was incapable of holding the parliamentary election on schedule, and have disbanded the Cabinet,"" the king said.
In his radio speech, the king said he also was postponing the Nov. 13 elections and would temporarily hold executive powers until a new government is formed.
He said a new government would be installed soon and set a five-day timeframe for political parties to suggest names for heading a caretaker government.
""The new government will hold the election soon, providing peace and security,"" the king said, adding the new prime minister in the caretaker government will not be able to contest the election.
Friday was the first time since a multiparty political system replaced absolute monarchy in the Himalayan kingdom in 1990 that a Nepalese king has fired an elected government and its leader.
The king normally holds little power to influence day-to-day affairs of the government and largely goes by the recommendation of the prime minister and Cabinet. At times of political crisis, however, Nepal's Constitution allows him to overrule the recommendations of an elected government and even remove the prime minister and disband his Cabinet.
Gyanendra assumed the throne after his brother and eight members of the royal family were killed on June 1, 2001, by Crown Prince Dipendra, who also took his own life.
The rebels, who have been fighting since 1996, have threatened to disrupt the elections. They also called a general strike from Nov. 11-13, to coincide with the scheduled first round of voting.
More than 5,000 people have been killed in the six-year insurgency, which the rebels claim is inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong. The rebels say they want to abolish the monarchy but keep the democratic institutions.
The Election Commission had announced a six-phase balloting process to enable troops to move across this Himalayan nation to protect voters and candidates.
The guerrillas intensified their attacks after the government lifted a state of emergency in August to allow free campaigning ahead of the elections.
Emergency rule was declared last year after the rebels abruptly ended peace talks with the government and resumed attacks on military and police. The emergency rule curbed civil liberties and gave security forces sweeping powers to detain people without trial.

The bomb, left on a first floor toilet, exploded just an hour after the office opened, leaving a gash in the wall and wounding the two people who were in the adjoining room.
This week is the deadline for a government plan for a voluntary disclosure of income tax and the office was expected to be crowded with people coming to declare their taxes.
No one has claimed responsibility. But police suspect the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for abolition of the monarchy in this Himalayan kingdom, were behind the explosion.
A state of emergency was declared in Nov. 26 and the army was ordered to fight the rebels joining an outmatched police force when rebels ended a four-month cease-fire and renewed attacks on government targets.
The army claims to have killed nearly 500 guerrillas and arrested another 1,400 since the emergency was declared. Officials say 140 government soldiers and police have been killed in the same period.
Led by commander Prachanda - whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal - the guerrillas have been fighting in remote mountainous areas since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and create a communist republic. More than 2,300 people have died in the fighting.

Security forces Sunday shot dead 11 rebels after discovering a Maoist hideout in the jungles of the Banke district, some 425 kilometers (265 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, the defense ministry said.
The dead included the chief of the Maoists' district committee, the ministry said in a statement, adding that the death toll could be higher.
It said government troops recovered arms the rebels had looted from attacks on army barracks and police posts.
Four more of the ultra-leftist guerrillas died in a similar clash Sunday in eastern Nepal, the ministry said.
Eighteen Maoists were killed late Saturday in more than six hours of fierce fighting in the Khotang district, 150 kilometres (93 miles) east of Kathmandu, police said.
The battle near Dorpa-Dobela village broke out after the rebels ambushed security forces coming through the area. The Maoists retreated back into the jungle after suffering the heavy casualties, including the death of their local commander, police said.
With the latest deaths 53 rebels have been killed in the Maoist insurgency since Friday, according to the official count. No deaths were reported among government troops.
Police said the Maoists also managed to block traffic for hours on the busy Prithivi highway, the main road connecting Kathmandu with western districts.
The rebels bombed sections of the highway late Saturday, triggering landslides that obstructed traffic. The Maoists also dug up part of the highway at Benighat, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) west of Kathmandu, police said.
The vital highway was reopened early Sunday after police scanned it for booby-traps, officials said.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy, in an insurgency that has left close to 3,200 people dead.
The rebels enjoy most of their support in the impoverished countryside, where they have promised radical redistribution of wealth.
Observers say the Maoists have been increasingly targetting civilian infrastructure to destroy any tangible achievements of the Kathmandu government.

"379",20021687,"Title: Nepalese cabinet asks king to delay election by a year.rtf; Date: October 3, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nepal's cabinet asked King Gyanendra on Thursday to delay parliamentary elections by one year until November 2003 due to the Maoist insurgency, officials said.
The government sent a letter to Gyanendra saying the ""deteriorating law-and-order situation"" in the country required a delay in the vote which had been scheduled for November, a senior cabinet source said.
Caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was expected to meet with Gyanendra later Thursday followed by a decision from the king.
The cabinet source said the government also wanted to hold elections for some 292,000 local-level seats before the parliamentary vote.
The Maoists have been waging an insurgency of increasing intensity since November 2001, when they broke a four-month ceasefire with Deuba's government.
The Maoists want to topple the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state. Their ""people's war"" has left nearly 5,000 people dead since 1996, with more than two-thirds of the deaths reported since the end of the truce.
Deuba has vowed to crush the Maoists and ruled out any talks with the rebels until they drop their demands that the constitution be redrafted.
The election to the 205-member assembly had already been announced in six rounds from November 13 to January 10.
But the elections, which would be held two years ahead of schedule, have been criticized by Deuba's political opponents and even some of his one-time allies.
The critics say a free and fair vote would be impossible with vast parts of the kingdom under de facto Maoist administration and other areas under the tight control of security forces.
Gyanendra dissolved parliament on Deuba's advice on May 22, two years ahead of schedule, as the house looked set to end emergency rule that gave security forces more power to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.
The king instead decreed another three months of emergency rule, which expired August 28.
The Nepali Congress, the kingdom's chief political party for a half-century, has split in two over the decision to call early elections.
Factions headed by Deuba and his predecessor as premier, Girija Prasad Koirala, were expected to run against each other in the elections.
Observers say the chaos in the Nepali Congress could tip the vote to the main opposition communist party, which held 69 seats in the dissolved assembly as opposed to 113 for the ruling party.
The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist opposes the Maoists but has called on Deuba to be more flexible to bring the rebels back to the table.

"380",20022822,"Title: Plucky pachyderms and ragged reporters take to field in elephant polo(3).rtf; Date: September 19, 2002 Thursday; Text: You mount a 2-ton beast of a breed that once stomped Asian armies into mush. A slender shaft, long as a knight's lance, is thrust into your hand. And the helmet is a solar topee right out of Rudyard Kipling.
Moments later, my mount charges down the field to confront two equally enormous opponents. Behemoths collide. Commands are shouted. Mallets swing, thrust, parry. And the exhilarating, unabashedly elitist but appealing sport of polo is under way.
Elephant polo, that is.
In this particular contest however, images of medieval derring-do and British Raj romance quickly crumble. We players - a bunch of none-too-youthful reporters pitted against four glamorous Thai TV and movie stars - happen to be rank amateurs, recruited for a curtain-raising ""exhibition"" to this year's real thing, the King's Cup Elephant Polo Tournament.
Despite the best efforts of the remarkable, specially trained elephants, including some cheeky cheating on our behalf, we did not look elite.
""Hey, Rodney your elephant played more than you did,"" someone shouted after the first chukka, or 10-minute period of play.
While Rodney Tasker, correspondent for the news magazine Far Eastern Economic Review, scored our only goal, he later admitted that ""the elephants seem to be the main players,"" doing their utmost to get into the best position to allow the curious humans teetering on their rolling rumps to smack the ball.
Doro, a mischievous 8-year-old female, appeared to get so frustrated with all of Rodney's misses that she helped him along by moving the ball smartly with her trunk and legs. This included perhaps the crispest shot of the day, a beautifully timed, surreptitious sideswipe with her right hind leg that put the ball out of reach of Rodney's onrushing opponent.
Elephants aren't supposed to interfere in the play, but such infractions are normally overlooked, said our referee and elephant polo veteran Col. Raj Kalaan. However, fouls are called when an elephant grabs the ball with its trunk and passes it to the player or lies across the goal mouth. At last year's King's Cup the ball kept vanishing because one pachyderm liked to stomp it into the ground.
It was Kalaan, a retired Indian army officer of patrician demeanor and silvery mustache, who initiated us into the rules, rituals and history of the game during a sweltering morning practice session before the match.
Kalaan, who keeps a polo field and 22 horses on his estate outside New Delhi, is a committee member of the World Elephant Polo Association, set up in 1982 to stage annual games near Nepal's Royal Chitwan National Park. Matches have also been played in Sri Lanka, and last year Thailand hosted its first tournament at this seaside resort to raise funds for elephant conservation.
The 2002 event, which ends Saturday, has drawn nine teams from six countries, including Australia, Germany, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
From the start, the sport has attracted avid horse polo players and holdovers from an earlier era of moneyed gentlemen eccentrics.
Regulars include sport co-founders James Manclark, who has searched for lost Inca treasure and bobsledded for England in the Olympics, and Jim Edwards, British owner of an exclusive wildlife lodge in Nepal.
Briton Geoffrey Dobbs sailed the Pacific in a bamboo raft trying to prove the Chinese reached America before Columbus. American Tom Clayton pilots planes around the African bush, carrying two horse polo mallets in the back of his Cessna 180.
While elephant polo could be regarded as a macho pursuit it's normally injury-free as long as one stays firmly strapped in the rope harness and doesn't argue with the referee, who always sits atop the biggest beast on the field. In our game it was Plai Kampheng, a titanic tusker weighing at least 3.5 tons.
""Thoy, thoy"" - ""Back up"" - was probably the most frequent cry during our contest as the elephant drivers, or mahouts, urged their charges into reverse so we could attempt yet another swing at the ball. Although the mahouts issued vital commands from their perches behind the animals' necks, the elephants seemed to read the game on their own, and get into its spirit.
While we had our moments, a substantial amount of play degenerated into what Kalaan called ""a muddle in the middle,"" a genteel description of what in fact were players thrashing and poking around with 8-foot mallets trying to locate and connect with an object not much larger than a tennis ball under the vast bellies of two or three enmeshed elephants.
After our 1-0 lead, we went into the second and last chukka a bit too cocky, allowing the youthful Thai stars to power their way through our ragged defense and tap three humiliating goals between the posts.
Some of us thought the stars had an unfair advantage with Atithep Chodchoi. This handsome actor had recently spent about a month on elephant back during the filming of an epic about the days when the animals served as battle tanks, and foot soldiers quaked i"
"381",20022149,"Title: Nepal government says 90 Maoists killed in overnight fighting.rtf; Date: May 3, 2002 Friday; Text: Security forces killed at least 90 Maoist guerrillas in western Nepal overnight, the government said Friday, days before the prime minister visits Washington to seek help in fighting the rebels.
The overnight fighting left one of the largest death tolls since King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency Nov. 26 and ordered the army to clamp down on the rebels after they withdrew from peace talks and attacked government troops and offices.
The rebels, who operate in more than half of this mountainous Himalayan kingdom of exquisite beauty and violent politics, want an end to the constitutional monarchy and sweeping reforms in land ownership. Their insurgency, inspired by Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-tung, has claimed more than 3,000 lives since it began in 1996.
Two army soldiers also were killed and another was wounded in the latest gunbattles with the rebels, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
At least 40 guerrillas were killed Thursday night during a gun battle with Nepalese army forces in Lisne, a village some 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, the statement said.
It said the fighting in Lisne started when Maoists attacked a team of security forces patrolling the area.
Elsewhere, security forces gunned down at least 50 guerrillas in the village of Bhagal, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Katmandu, the ministry said.
The death toll was the highest since battles on April 11-12 left more than 200 policemen and guerrilla fighters dead - the deadliest couple of days in the rebels' 6-year-old campaign to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy with a communist state.
The government intensified its campaign against the rebels after the guerrillas called for a nationwide strike last week that did not get much public support.
More than 150 guerrillas have been killed in the last week, junior Interior Minister Devendra Raj Kandel said.
Human rights group Amnesty International has accused both the security forces and the insurgents of killing civilians and committing other atrocities.
The intensified fighting comes ahead of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's visit to Washington next week. He is scheduled to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush to discuss the insurgency.
Nepal's government has ruled out peace talks until the rebels give up violence, and is seeking international help to fight them. The Bush administration recently asked Congress for dlrs 20 million in military aid for Nepal.

"382",2002407,"Title: India claims second unmanned Pakistani spy plane violates Indian airspace.rtf; Date: January 9, 2002 Wednesday; Text: An unmanned Pakistani spy plane intruded into Indian airspace Wednesday, but escaped the fate of a similar drone that was shot down earlier in the week, an Indian army officer said.
The army officer said the small aircraft flew over India for 10 minutes about 35 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Jammu, the winter capital of the disputed Himalayan province of Kashmir. Security forces fired at it, but it turned toward Pakistan unharmed.
There was no immediate comment on the incident from Pakistan.
On Sunday, the Indian military claimed to have shot down a Pakistani drone after it flew four kilometers (2.5 miles) into Kashmir. Pakistani officials denied this, claiming the aircraft was India's own.
Tensions have risen between India and Pakistan since an attack on the Indian Parliament last month in which 14 people were killed, including five assailants. New Delhi has accused the Pakistani spy agency of sponsoring the assault, a charge that Islamabad denies.
Also Wednesday, Indian security forces shot and killed a suspected Islamic militant after a three-hour standoff in a mosque in Kashmir.
Indian and Pakistani troops resumed firing at one another in the northern sector of Kashmir across the Line of Control, the cease-fire line that divides the region between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.
Predominantly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947.
The United States, Britain, China and other nations have called on the South Asian rivals to negotiate and end the risk of a fourth war. Washington is concerned that the hostilities could undermine its campaign against the Taliban and al-Qaida terrorist network in nearby Afghanistan.
Since the Dec. 13 assault on Parliament, India and Pakistan have massed hundreds of thousands troops along their 1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile) border, cut their diplomatic staffs by half and closed off their border to air, bus and train travel.
Informal contact between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf during a summit of South Asian leaders in Nepal last week failed to ease tensions.
Musharraf was expected to make an important speech later this week outlining his military regime's new policies toward Islamic extremists operating from Pakistani territory.
However, senior Pakistani officials tried Wednesday to play down expectations that Musharraf was planning a crackdown. Such hopes were raised by U.S. senators who met with Musharraf Tuesday and said he would unveil a ""bold and principled"" initiative to ease the threat of war.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the senators may have misunderstood existing Pakistani policies aimed at fighting Islamic radicalism.
Vajpayee has refused to negotiate until Pakistan cracks down on the militants. He has also demanded the extradition of 20 suspects involved in alleged terrorist attacks in India.
Pakistan has arrested some 300 Islamic extremists in the last few weeks, but India says that they were arrested for violations of Pakistani law, not for suspected acts of terrorism.
More than a dozen Islamic militant groups have been fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir since 1989, seeking its independence or merger with Pakistan. At least 32,000 people have died in the insurgency.
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training the militants; Islamabad calls the guerrillas ""freedom fighters"" and says it only offers them moral support.
Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, a hard-liner in Vajpayee's Cabinet, was in Washington on Wednesday and was scheduled to meet Attorney General John Aschcroft and Secretary of State Colin Powell.
On Wednesday, Indian officials said two militants, belonging to the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen militant group, had sought refuge in a mosque in Bamurada, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
Soldiers surrounded the mosque and used loudspeakers to try to persuade the two to surrender, said R.P. Sandhu, commanding officer of the army operation. The pair opened fire and military return fire killed one suspected militant and injured the other, Sandhu said.
Despite the mobilization of forces along their border, generals on both sides have maintained weekly phone contact, a routine established in 1985.
The military operations chiefs of India and Pakistan most recently spoke Tuesday, said defense ministry spokesman P.K. Bandhopadhyaya.
He said the two had spoken every week, only missing calls over Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim festival marking the end of Ramadan, and Christmas.

The public meeting, organised by the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Lenist (NCP-UML) was held at an open air theatre in Kathmandu.
More than 250 riot peace stood guard but the protest was peaceful.
King Gyanendra sacked former prime minster Sher Bahadur Deuba October 4 and took power for almost a week before installing an interim government headed by staunch royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand and postponing elections due in November.
Political parties have denounced the king's actions as ""undemocratic and unconstitutional.""
""The king should also abide by the 1990 constitution and act democratically,"" by consulting with the kingdom's political parties to seek a way out of the current crisis, said NCP-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal.
""He should not ignore the aspirations of the people otherwise the consequences could be very serious.""
Nepal also criticised the new interim government.
""The government headed by Lokendra Bahadur Chand has not been able to achieve anything even after nearly three months of its formation,"" he said.
""The continuation of this government means adding more trouble and and complications.""
Another NCP-UMNL leader, K.P. Sharma Oli, also flayed Gyanendra for violating the constitution.

A Nepalese home ministry official said 17 people had been killed across the country in fresh floods this week, including nine in Dhankuta district, 300 kilometres (180 miles) east of Kathmandu, after rain triggered a landslide on a village.
Another five people drowned in the nearby district of Bhojpur, two more were killed in the northern Sindhupalchowk district, and another fell victim to the swollen Sthul Khola river in the western Gorkha district, the official said.
He said the death toll in Nepal since the monsoon season began in mid-July had now reached 333, with the worst affected areas in the central and eastern districts of the country.
In addition, millions of rupees worth of infrastructure and property have been damaged.
In India, where millions have been made homeless by floods in the northeast of the country, six people were killed and 11 injured Wednesday in a landslide in the western commercial hub of Bombay following more rain.
The incident occurred in a largely residential area of central Bombay following 18 hours of heavy rains, a police spokesman said.
He said rescue work was continuing and most of those trapped by the deluge of mud had been rescued. The dead included a woman and a child.
Bombay has been lashed by heavy rains since Saturday, flooding roads and low lying areas.
In the eastern state of Bihar the death toll has risen to 189, according to officials.
A total of 32 flood-related deaths were reported from various districts in the north and west of the state since the start of the week, the Relief and Rehabilitation Department said.
Altogether 13 million people and 6,500 villages in the state have been affected by the floods.
The Hindi-language Hindustan newspaper reported that another 20 people died when a boat sank in the Katihar district of Bihar on Tuesday, but state officials could not confirm the deaths.
Officials said that water levels in most rivers in the state were now showing signs of receding.
Elsewhere in South Asia, more than 2.3 million Bangladeshis have been left stranded or homeless by floodwaters since July when some 200,000 homes were submerged.
Nineteen people have died, mainly from water-borne diseases, officials said, while hundreds of people are ill in 13 flood affected districts, where homes and crops have been damaged.
At least 1,200 new cases of diarrhoea have been reported to doctors in the districts, according to government officials, but there were no reports of further deaths.
The authorities said food and medicines were being rushed to the affected areas.

""The situation is very alarming as all the major rivers are flowing above the danger level in five of the states nine districts,"" he added.
Officials said the flood waters had breached mud embankments in 50 places, inundating several localities.
Three people drowned in the state on Tuesday when they were washed away by the floods, which some local newspaper reports here said were also affecting neighbouring Myanmar.
Across South Asia, more than 800 people have died in monsoon flooding, most of them in Nepal.
S. Debendra Singh, additional chief engineer of Manipurs flood control department, said floodwaters had submerged several areas on the outskirts of the state capital Imphal.
Thousands of people have built raised wooden platforms to escape the waters.
The flood situation in the neigbouring state of Assam, which is the largest of the seven northeastern states, was easing in some areas.
""The water level is receding, but the villages are still surrounded by water making it difficult for people to return to their homes,"" said Longki Phangsu, district magistrate of Assam's flood-ravaged north Lakhmipur area.
A Central Water Commission bulletin on Thursday said the state's main Brahmaputra river was still flowing above the danger level in five places.
The flooding in Assam has left 5.3 million people homeless since July.
At least 68 people have been killed in floods and landslides in Assam, Mizoram, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh states in the northeast since last month.
Meanwhile, the waters in eastern Indian Bihar state's main Ganges river and its tributory PunPun were rising and threatening to flood new areas, an official said.
The Bihar state government has put the death toll in the floods at 288. The chief secretary of Bihar, S.N. Biswas, has sought help from the federal government to deal with the situation.
The raging floods have left a swathe of destruction across South Asia, including Nepal and Bangladesh.
In Nepal, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said 422 people had died this monsoon season. The home ministry put the toll at 348, with 70 missing.
In Bangladesh, three children were killed on Tuesday when their home was buried in a landslide in the southeastern port city of Chittagong, police said.

"392",2002329,"Title: Nepal king swears in monarchist as prime minister.rtf; Date: October 11, 2002 Friday; Text: A week after he sacked the government, Nepal's King Gyanendra swore in the head of a pro-monarchy party as the new prime minister Friday, a move which angered the country's top politicians.
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who has served three previous terms as prime minister, will hold the office until parliamentary elections can be held. Palace officials announced that Chand and five members of his Cabinet were sworn in by the king at the royal palace on Friday evening. No date has been set for the polls.
The announcement was made as 4,000 supporters of the two biggest political parties protested the king's firing last week of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Cabinet, after Deuba recommended that general elections, which had been scheduled to begin next month, be postponed because of threat of disruption by Maoist rebels.
The king's moves have frightened many democracy supporters in this Himalayan nation. The monarch has the constitutional power to oust an elected government, but had seldom waded into active politics since the absolute monarchy ended in 1990 and democracy was introduced.
Chand, 63, heads the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. He was prime minister once under the absolute monarchy, and twice in the democratic era.
""My first priority will be to restore peace and stability in the country for which I will try to open dialogue with the Maoist rebels,"" Chand told reporters. The Maoists have been fighting the government for six years and their insurgency has wreaked havoc across large parts of rural Nepal.
The king named Badri Prasad Mandal, chairman of pro-India Nepal Goodwill Party, as the deputy prime minister. Narendra Bikram Shah, a retired top foreign ministry official, was appointed foreign minister and a well-known neurologist, Upendra Devkota, became health minister.
Leading politicians voiced opposition Friday to the appointments, saying they weren't consulted, although they had been waiting for days for an audience with the king to discuss the make-up of the interim government. The king only met the leaders of six main political parties briefly Friday before the appointments were announced.
""The new government is not even close to what all political parties have been seeking. We were not consulted about formation of this government and we don't support it,"" said Arjun Narsingh of the Nepali Congress, the Himalayan state's largest political party.
""It was a total surprise for us,"" said Jhalnath Khanal of the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal. The party's decision-making committee will hold an emergency meeting Saturday to plan what to do next, he said.
On Friday, 4,000 supporters of the the Nepali Congress and the Nepali Communist Party, waving flags and placards, marched through the streets of the capital Katmandu to protest the sacking of the former prime minister Deuba, although he belongs to neither party. They chanted: ""Save democracy,"" and ""Save our constitution.""
When he fired Deuba, Gyanendra indefinitely postponed the elections that had been scheduled to start Nov. 13. Deuba had asked them to be postponed for one year.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to abolish the constitutional monarchy and create a communist state. They had increased attacks since the king accepted Deuba's request to lift a national state of emergency in August to allow for election campaigning.
The emergency had been imposed last November after the rebels broke off peace talks. Under the emergency decree, freedoms of speech, press and assembly were severely restricted and people could be detained on suspicion of favoring the Maoists.
Gyanendra ascended to the throne last year after his brother - former King Birendra - and eight other royal family members were killed in a bizarre palace massacre. A government inquiry later found that the then-crown prince shot the other victims before taking his own life.
Chand first served as prime minister for three years under the absolute monarchy, when political parties were banned.
The late King Birendra named Chand as interim prime minister during Nepal's transition from absolute monarchy to democracy in 1990, but he was forced to step down after 11 days, when a coalition of top political parties formed an interim government and later conducted an election in 1991.
Chand again became prime minister in 1997, in a coalition with the communist party that lasted six months. Chand could not hold onto his position because of feuds in his own party.

Four rebels were also killed in the Surkhet district and three other guerrillas were slain in the Salyan district, both in mid-western Nepal.
In three different districts of west Nepal, three rebels were also killed, it said.
Troops also arrested five Maoist guerrillas and seized arms and ammunitions.
Nepal declared a state of emergency and ordered the army to fight the rebels in November last year, after they broke off peace talks and began new attacks at police and army positions.
The rebels, who draw their inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, took up arms against the government six years ago.
The rebels are fighting to root out Nepal's constitutional monarchy and multiparty rule. More than 3,000 people have died in the six-year fighting.

The National Planning Commission (NPC) said growth would be just 4.3 percent if the Maoist violence continued.
""The NPC has projected two economic growth targets for the next five years -- 6.2 percent is a normal growth rate only if the security problem is solved,"" the newly-appointed vice chairman of the NPC Dr Shanker Nath Sharma told AFP.
""If the law and order situation does not improve the annual economic growth can be targeted to achieve only 4.3 percent marking a low rate growth,"" Sharma said.
Nepal's economy is in the doldrums and Finance Minister Badri Prasad Shrestha said in October that the country's economic growth in the previous three months had been stagnant.
Tourism, the main hard currency earner in the land of Mount Everest, has plummeted since June 2001, when Gyanendra's brother king Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were massacred by the drunken former crown prince.
Many visitors are still staying away because of a violent Maoist rebellion which has killed some 7,300 people since 1996.
Earlier this month the rebels said they had formed a committee to hold talks with Nepal's government and suggested they would halt their attacks on civilian infrastructure.
The growth figures were part of the 10th five-year plan which sets out targets and spending for five years from July 2002 to July 2007.
During the 10th plan between 6.2 billion and 8.2 billion dollars will be invested, Sharma said.
""The 10th five-year plan has set poverty alleviation as the objective to bring down the level of people living in poverty from 42 percent to 30 percent,"" Sharma said.
During the ninth plan from 1997 to 2002 growth was 3.6 percent against a targeted 6 percent.

The team is scheduled to meet with travel agents and the media in Shanghai on July 25 and in Beijing on July 29, the state-run English daily quoted Basanta Bahadur Hamal, a NATA executive member, as saying.
""We will hold interactions with Chinese travel agencies that have been permitted to handle Chinese outbound visitors to Nepal and with the local media in order to promote our tourism industry, "" Hamal told local reporters Friday.
""Since China has already announced Nepal as its travel destination, we hope that this visit will help us to design a tour package which will be able to attract more Chinese tourists to visit Nepal,"" he added.
He also noted that the main problem existing on the Nepali side currently is the lack of information to the Chinese travelers about the Himalayan Kingdom, therefore he hoped the promotional program will help disseminate more information about Nepal to the Chinese people.
Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on tourism in November last year in order to promote the tourist industry between the two countries.
However, tourist arrivals in Nepal have plummeted due to the escalating violence by the anti-government guerrillas in the country and the continuing terrorist threats to the world after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11 last year.
Tourism is one of the main foreign currency earners for Nepal, earning about 150 million US dollars last year.

Before his departure for India, Gyanendra said in a statement: ""Nepal adopted the policy of developing friendly relations with the nations of the world according to the principles of sovereignty, equality, peace and mutual understanding.""
He said the visit would help to further strengthen relations between Nepal and India.
The visit comes shortly after rituals were carried out to mark the anniversary of the deaths of 10 members of the royal family on June 1, 2001.
Gyanendra's brother, King Birendra, and eight other royals were shot down by by the drunken crown prince Dipendra, who then shot himself, leaving Gyanendra the next in line to the throne.
The scheduling of his trip to India reflects the importance of the landlocked kingdom's ties with its giant neighbor, on which it depends for access to ports.
India has pledged military support to Nepal as it battles a Maoist insurgency that has taken on a new intensity since November, when the rebels broke a ceasefire.

Another eight guerrillas, including four women, were killed in the last 24 hours in western Nepal, home ministry officials said.
The defence ministry statement said 67 of those who were killed on Saturday were rebels who were involved in daring attacks on an army post on February 16 in the Accham district in which more than 150 people, mostly police and soldiers, died.
They had escaped and were hiding in forested areas of the neighbouring Kalikot district, 360 kilometres (223 miles) west of Kathmandu, the defence ministry said.
""Security forces started searching for them deep inside the forest approaching from all sides,"" the statement said.
""Sixty-seven terrorists were killed and from the site of the clash, arms, home made bombs and communication sets were recovered as well as a large quantity of food supplies, which had been looted by the Maoists.""

""The United States is very concerned about what is happening in Nepal and we hope that the Nepali government will play an important role in fighting against terrorism not only inside of Nepal but in all over the world,"" said Powell at the press conference after his talks with Nepali Prime Minister Shel Bahadul Deuba.
Deuba, who is also in charge of foreign affairs, said that the Nepali government has already supported and showed its commitment in fighting against terrorism when the U.S. called for a broader coalition against the global menace after the United States was attacked by the terrorists on September 11 last year.
Deuba also said that since fighting against terrorism is costly, it needs support on many fronts and Nepal would like to seek financial assistance and other technical support from the U.S.

'We will not allow the polls to be held. I assure you that there would not be an election,' the Kathmandu Post quoted a rebel leader as saying in an interview at a Maoist hideout on the outskirts of the capital Tuesday.
The newspaper identified the rebel, who used the nom-de-guerre Bikalpa, as a leader in charge of coordinating antigovernment activities in Kathmandu and adjoining cities.
The vow to disrupt the elections comes amid stepped-up attacks in the capital, where explosion and bomb scares have become a daily occurrence.
The rebel leader said the general public, facing more pressing concerns that are not being adequately addressed, does not want the election to be held.
On Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's advice, King Gyanendra last May dissolved parliament and called an election for Nov. 13.
Last Tuesday, Deuba said on his return home from Europe that the election would be held as planned.
In the interview, the rebel leader also demanded a roundtable conference of all political parties, the royal palace and the army to steer Nepal out of the present chaotic political situation.
During peace talks with the government last year, the rebels demanded a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution that would replace Nepal's present constitution, which provides for multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy.
The rebels walked out of the talks saying Prime Minister Deuba was nowhere near conceding to their demand.
The rebels, drawing inspiration from Chinese revolutionary Mae Zedong, want to abolish monarchy and set up a republican state in Nepal.
To that end, they have been waging a 'people's war,' for the last seven years that Nepalese human rights organizations say has claimed nearly 6,000 lives.
'This roundtable conference should decide on our demand of a constituent assembly by going to the people,' the rebel leader told the Kathmandu Post.
'Fine that they (the people) might not be in favor of the changes we want, but they definitely want changes in the present chaotic situation,' he said.
Meanwhile, police arrested seven Maoist rebels Wednesday, including a regional commander identified as Chhetradhoj Lama, at Patan, a city south of Kathmandu, the Home Ministry said Thursday.

The protest was led by the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which says its detained leader Yasin Malik was Wednesday attacked during a hospital check-up by activists of the far-right Hindu movement Shiv Sena.
Dozens of Malik supporters, led by acting JKLF chairman Javed Mir, poured onto the streets of Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar, chanting slogans against Shiv Sena and the Indian authorities.
Police baton-charged the crowd and detained seven people, including Mir and human rights activist Ahsan Untoo. They were whisked away to a neighbouring police station in security vehicles, witnesses said.
Youths then pelted stones at the police, who responded with tear-gas shells.
Hospital sources said at least six people were injured, including a photographer for the local media, Arshid Mir.
Malik was arrested on March 25 as he gave a press conference in Srinagar. He has denied police charges that 100,000 dollars was smuggled illegally into Kashmir for him from Nepal.
The JKLF leader is being held in Kashmir's Hindu-majority winter capital Jammu, where he has been allowed a medical check-up every 48 hours.
Police in Jammu denied that Malik was assaulted, saying bodyguards blocked Shiv Sena activists who barged into his hospital room.
The JKLF has called for a one-day strike Friday to protest the ""assault and continuing state-sponsored terrorism"" in Muslim-majority Kashmir, the scene of a 13-year separatist insurgency that has left at least 35,000 dead.
The JKLF, which laid down its arms in 1993, favors an independent Kashmir.
Shiv Sena, an ally in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's coalition, is known for its far-right views on Pakistani and Indian Muslims.
One of its senior leaders, Manohar Joshi, was Wednesday elected speaker of the national parliament.

'This agreement is entered into for the purpose of establishing basic terms, conditions, and procedures to facilitate the reciprocal provisions of logistic support, supplies and services,' the pact dubbed as Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) said.
The agreement is hoped to be signed by October between the U.S. Department of Defense and the Philippine Department of National Defense.
The agreement is expected to eliminate paperwork and procedures that go with the standard process in buying and selling U.S. supplies, support and services.
Under the agreement, the U.S. can transfer all classes of supplies in the U.S. inventory, except major items, specified munitions and items prohibited by law, such as guided missiles, nuclear ammunition, naval mines, torpedoes, chemical ammunition and other advanced weapon systems.
'Each party shall exert its best efforts, consistent with national priorities, to satisfy requests from the other party under this agreement for logistical support, supplies and services,' the draft document says.
'This agreement applies to the reciprocal provision of logistic support supplies, and services between the military forces of one party by the other party in return for either cash payment or the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, and services to the military forces of the other party,' according to the document.
The agreement is to remain in force a period of 10 years, and will be subject to review by the parties at least one year before termination to consider the possibility of extending it under mutually acceptable terms, the document adds.
'Notwithstanding this, the parties may, at any time, terminate this agreement by means of a written notice to the other party, through diplomatic channels. Termination shall take effect six months following the date of notification,' it notes.
Military analysts said the U.S. needs the MLSA more than the Philippines, more so because of the ongoing U.S. war against international terrorists. Thus, they said, the U.S. maintains similar access arrangements with other countries where the U.S. does not maintain a permanent military base, including in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh on the Indian subcontinent, and in Indonesia in the Southeast Asian region.
The proposed agreement, however, has angered militant groups in the Philippines, warning it will pave the way for the U.S. troops to openly operate in the Philippines.
The U.S. is wrapping up a joint counterterrorism exercise with the Philippine troops in the southern Philippines this month. The U.S. brought in communication equipment and other materiel during the six-month war games.
Many of its facilities, including its satellite systems, temporary shelters and other infrastructure, are not suited to being dismantled and carried back to their home bases.
With the MLSA, the equipment could remain in the Philippines and be used in the next war games that both forces plan to conduct in the future.
U.S. and Philippine troops are planning to start a series of joint war games again in October.
A senior defense official said the proposed agreement would enhance 'interoperability and supportability of U.S. military operations in the war against international terrorism. The agreement would actually complement the existing Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) which the Philippines and the U.S. forged in May 1999.'.
The U.S. has been trying to forge an acquisition-and-cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) with the Philippines since 1994, but then President Fidel Ramos decided to shelve the plan following mounting opposition from militants.
The MLSA is apparently an 'ACSA-type arrangement under a different name,' its opponents charge.

Budhathoki had been briefly detained by police under emergency laws earlier this year and released about two months ago.
Police are allowed to carry out arrests without warrants and all civil liberties, including media rights, have been suspended under the emergency rule.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists, an umbrella group of media rights organizations, said at least 59 journalists have been taken into custody by the police since the emergency was imposed.

"403",2002440,"Title: Nepali travelers learn patience, humor when crossing mountain mudslides(2).rtf; Date: NA; Text: Associated Press Writer
ALONG THE ARANIKO HIGHWAY, Nepal (AP) - First there was just one car, whose driver stopped and stared at the lake of mud. Then a bus stopped. Within an hour Saturday afternoon, dozens of vehicles were parked on either side of the mudslide.
When the hill gave way above the Araniko Highway, slopping a few tons of soupy muck onto the asphalt, there was nothing any of the travellers blocked by the slide could do, unless they were willing to get very muddy.
So that's what they did, goading each other through the waist-high mud and laughing at those who tried it, in one of the few light moments of a monsoon season that has brought little but despair to this Himalayan kingdom.
The monsoon rains have killed more than 500 people in Nepal in the past month, most of them in landslides. Even when not lethal, the mudslides can seriously hamper daily life.
The slide happened in the early afternoon under a steady rain on this highway, which runs from Katmandu, Nepal's capital, to the Chinese border along the valley of the Bhote Koshi River.
As cars and buses piled up, umbrellas burst open as travelers stepped out into the rain to examine their predicament. Two growing communities blossomed quickly on each side of the mudslide, which spread about 75 wide across the road as it flowed down into the river.
At first, dozens of people standing in the rain looked glumly to the other side, with just a few willing to poke their way across. The crowd saw what happened to the first few explorers, most of whom took at least 20 minutes to make it and emerged coated in mud. As the rain let up, though, and it became obvious that no bulldozers were racing to this isolated spot to help, the mood lightened.
Two men argued about whether a motorcyclist could drag his bike to the other side. He could. A young man in tattered clothes reached out to help a grinning woman in an elegant sari picking her way across. A small crowd laughed good-naturedly when a young girl in pink pants slipped from a trail and into the muck, wailing for her mother.
Landslides are common during the rainy season along Nepal's mountain roads. Road-clearing equipment is rare in this, one of the world's poorest countries. During the three-month rainy season, normally ending in mid-September, many find themselves again and again waiting out slides.
There is even a transportation system to cope with blocked roads. When buses can't get through, the passengers get off one bus, slog across the mud and get into another on the other side, taking over seats left by passengers heading the opposite direction. The buses then turn around and head back the way they came.
If the bus conductors are feeling generous, they'll negotiate partial refunds or discounts. No matter what, though, the passengers come out the losers.
""We'll fight for our refund,"" said Pemba Lama, a Katmandu resident heading to a rural village. ""But even if he gives us some money, we'll still be ripped off, and have to pay more to get back to our village.""
After about an hour, a road crew finally showed up: three men with broken shovels and a foreman wearing a beat-up yellow construction hat. They quickly realized this job was too much for them.
""Mud this deep, we can barely walk across. Cleaning it away is beyond our might,"" said the foreman, Jit Bahadur Majhi, who said he believed a bulldozer would eventually arrive.
For some, the crew's failure was far from funny. Hundreds of people were inconvenienced by the mudslide. For some the situation was dire.
Padam Rasayili, a Katmandu curio vendor, was heading to his village to see his wife, sick with respiratory troubles. He'd arrived on a motorcycle, but didn't think he could get it across.
""I have to go home as soon as possible,"" he said, eyeing the mud. ""I don't know what I'm going to do.""

"404",20022107,"Title: Rebels kill 57 soldiers, policemen in Nepal.rtf; Date: September 9, 2002 Monday; Text: Royal Nepalese Army soldiers launched a counterattack Monday on Maoist guerrillas who killed at least 57 soldiers and policemen in a midwestern mountainous area overnight, a government minister said.
Devendra Raj Kadel, Nepal's junior interior minister, said the army was fighting near Sandhikhara, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Katmandu, where the rebels had killed the 17 soldiers and 40 police in their deadliest assault since the government lifted a state of emergency two weeks ago.
""We have reports that a group of rebels who were fleeing from Sandhikhara have been found and we have sent additional forces to combat them,"" Kadel said.
Also Monday, an army bomb squad defused an explosive devise planted in Katmandu's main market. No one was injured but traffic was blocked for hours. The rebels have been blamed for a series of recent explosions in Katmandu that have killed at least one soldier.
Sunday, rebels attacked a remote mountain outpost southeast of the capital, killing at least 49 police officers.
The latest attacks began after the government on Aug. 28 lifted a state of emergency that had been in place since late last year to combat the Maoist insurgency.
The emergency was lifted to prepare for parliamentary elections set for November. Opposition politicians had expressed concerns that candidates wouldn't be able to campaign freely amid the emergency, which gave security forces sweeping powers to curtail civil liberties.
Reports from the scene of the latest attack said the rebels struck government offices in Sandhikhara around midnight.
Defense Ministry spokesman Bhupendra Poudel said the rebels also kidnapped two police officials and an assistant chief district official identified as Baburam Khatiwada, who was the highest ranking government official in Sandhikhara.
The insurgents, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy since 1996. The government says nearly 5,000 people - including 3,290 rebels - have been killed in the six years of fighting, mostly in the countryside.

'We have agreed by consensus to lend fresh impetus to the process,' said Sharatsingh Bhandari, Nepalese health minister and chairman of the 23rd session of the SAARC Council of Ministers.
SAARC, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Nepal currently chairs SAARC.
Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who holds the portfolio of foreign affairs, inaugurated the meeting but Bhandari presided over the session.
The foreign ministers agreed to introduce new areas of cooperation such as tourism, information and communications, biotechnology, and transportation to the integrated program of action, Bhandari said.
Emphasis was put on swift implementation of the action program and preferential trading arrangements and seeking the long-term goal of a free trade zone in the region.
The SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism adopted in 1987 will be updated. Ministers and legal advisers will meet shortly to frame an additional protocol to the convention.
Sri Lanka has offered to host a SAARC ministerial meeting to this end, Bhandari said.
Indian External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said India, the regional grouping's dominant member, is fully committed to the SAARC process.
'We want SAARC to prosper as a powerful instrument for regional cooperation,' he said.
'We will not allow the bilateral issue to cloud the SAARC process,' he said. Relations between India and Pakistan, another major force in the grouping, have soured since the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament in December last year.
Sinha denied reports that India would not take part in the 12th SAARC summit meeting to be held in Pakistan. The next summit will be held in Pakistan sometime between Jan. 5 and 20 next year.
SAARC was established in 1985 to promote peace, stability and economic cooperation in the region, which plays host to the largest number of poor in the world.

"408",200250,"Title: E-Commerce Report Novica.com will use money from elephants' paintings to preserve the species, make.rtf; Date: June 17, 2002 Monday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
CRITICS have at times derisively accused Internet retailers of engaging in a form of corporate charity -- functioning as de facto nonprofits that give away the millions they received from venture capitalists and shareholders to advertising firms, online portals and other beneficiaries. 
     Some e-tailers are now putting a more legitimate spin on that idea by giving away some or most of the profits from certain sales to charitable organizations. Starting today, for example, Novica.com, an online and catalog merchant of international artwork and crafts, will market paintings produced by elephants, with most of the profits funneled to groups that support elephant preservation in foreign countries. In return, executives at Novica.com hope to benefit by stimulating sales and generating customer loyalty. 
 It may make little sense for profit-minded companies in the conventional retail world to pursue such a strategy because there may not be enough socially conscious consumers in a geographic area. But for e-tailers, not bound by geographic boundaries, charitable pump-priming may have value. 
At least that is the hope of Novica in pitching elephant paintings. ""We think this can do social good as well as make business sense,"" said Roberto Milk, the chief executive of Novica.com. 
For the uninitiated, elephant paintings have gained a small following in recent years among art aficionados. Some of the buyers merely enjoy the novelty of hanging an animal's artistic renderings on their walls. Others argue that it is serious art, worthy of sober discussions on abstract expressionism and comparisons to the output of Willem deKooning and Jackson Pollock. 
According to those who have trained the elephants to paint, the animals choose colors with apparent deliberation, before dragging their brushes across the canvas with their trunks. The animals whose works now sell on Novica.com are from elephant conservation centers in Thailand and Bali, and those centers will receive 60 percent of the sale price. The remaining money will go to Novica.
Mr. Milk said the effort fit Novica.com's corporate mission of selling products profitably while also supporting the cultures that produce the goods. ""This will hopefully generate some customer good will,"" said Mr. Milk, who hopes the effort will help establish a repeat clientele. 
Customer loyalty is more important than ever for Internet retailers, as marketing budgets continue to dwindle and investors show only scant willingness to pump more money into dot-coms. 
One of Novica's direct competitors, Eziba, is also engaged in charitable selling, for some of the same reasons described by Mr. Milk. Eziba, which sells crafts made by international artisans through its Web site and a catalog and, recently, in stores, introduced a monthly feature in March called ""Gifts that Give Back."" Under that program, each month the site lists a new item that generates proceeds for a charity. 
This month, for instance, Eziba is selling a $98 ""meditation collection,"" which includes a candle, incense and other items made by Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal. Eziba gives about $10 from each sale to Tibet House, which was founded by the Dalai Lama in 1987 to support Tibetan cultural traditions. On other items, the store gives away as much as 15 percent of the purchase price. 
Bill Miller, Eziba's chief executive, said the company began diverting a portion of revenue from certain items to charity last year, and now lists about a dozen such items on its site, supporting six charities. Through jewelry sales, for example, Eziba has contributed more than $25,000 to V-Day, a group trying to stop violence against women, and $15,000 to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. 
Mr. Miller said the charitable efforts had improved the company's prospects for reaching profitability next year. Although Eziba clears a smaller profit on each item sold in ""Gifts That Give Back,"" a greater sales volume generates more profit than many other categories of goods on the site. 
According to Christopher Merritt, a principal with Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm, the Internet is well suited to companies with a charitable bent. ""For this to work, you'd need an online presence so the people who are interested in it have a place to go,"" Mr. Merritt said. ""And having a Web site helps you tell the story better."" 
A fine arts site that so far has not declined to tie products to specific charities is Guild.com. 
The site was bought back last year from the online jeweler Ashford.com, just a few months after Ashford acquired it. Toni Sikes, founder and chief executive of Guild.com, said the site turned profitable in April, but she would not disclose revenues. She did say that the average order size on her site was nearly $500, with paintings typically selling for $1,000 to $3,000. The artists deliver items to consumers directly, and Guild.com makes a 50 percent margin on each sale. "
"409",20021547,"Title: Nepal king due to delay appointment of interim government.rtf; Date: October 9, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Nepal looked set to enter deeper political crisis Wednesday as an official said King Gyanendra would break his self-imposed deadline to relinquish power and appoint an interim government.
The king will delay the naming of the new administration after being petitioned by hundreds of people seeking cabinet posts, a palace source said.
""All these petitions are being looked at and it will take a day or two to process them properly,"" the source said.
Gyanendra on Friday declared premier Sher Bahadur Deuba ""incompetent"" and assumed power in what he called a temporary move.
The constitutional monarch had promised to put in place an administration by midnight Thursday (1815 GMT Wednesday) to govern the troubled kingdom until fresh elections could be held.
But as the deadline loomed, Gyanendra headed to the Shah dynasty's ancestral town of Gorkha, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, to pay homage to the family god Gorakhnath.
The appointment of the new government could cause even more friction with the political class, as the major parties had by Wednesday not submitted names of candidates for the government.
The party leaders had been holding out for a meeting with the king. In a letter they demanded that the interim administration be made of parties from the disbanded parliament to ""ensure the continuity of parliamentary democracy.""
But sources said the two names most floated for the post of interim prime minister were both of strong supporters of the monarchy who did not serve in the last parliament.
One of them is Kirtinidhi Bista, who served as prime minister four times during Nepal's three decades of absolute royal rule, which Gyanendra's late brother Birendra ended in 1990 after massive pro-democracy protests.
The other is Dhaman Nath Dhungana, the speaker of the first parliament after the restoration of democracy. A royalist, Dhungana was on a Deuba-appointed team that failed last year to broker peace with Maoist rebels.
The main opposition party in the dissolved parliament said it would not accept the appointment of royalists only.
""We will not accept the interim government if His Majesty selects only his own people,"" said Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist.
Gyanendra officially has a ceremonial role, but is commander of the army and is held in high esteem by some traditional segments of the population who consider the king an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu.
Gyanendra assumed the throne in June 2001 after Birendra and nine other members of the royal family were massacred by the drunken crown prince, who turned the gun on himself.
A senior British diplomat due in Kathmandu Wednesday, to chair a meeting on financial assistance for the kingdom as it battles the Maoists, called for the king to restore multiparty democracy.
Mike O'Brien, the British Foreign Office minister for Asia, said in a statement before leaving London that it was ""vitally important"" any actions by Gyanendra ""are in accordance with Nepal's constitution, a step to restoring multiparty democracy and in the interests of the people of Nepal.""
Some 5,000 people have been reported dead since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996 for a communist republic. Tourism, the main hard currency earner in the land of Mount Everest, has been crippled by the insurgency.
The king has taken a more hawkish approach toward the Maoists than his late brother, in November 2001 deploying the army against the guerrillas for the first time.
Deuba took office in July 2001 vowing to broker peace with the ultra-leftist guerrillas, but talks collapsed four months later over Maoist demands that the monarchy be scrapped.
Sources close to Deuba said the former prime minister was gravely demoralized after being sacked. He has also been dismissed by the Nepali Congress party, which has moved to exclude him from the interim government.

Minister for forest and soil conservation, Gopal Man Shrestha, tendered his resignation to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba but insisted that he had done nothing wrong and said there was a ""conspiracy"" against him.
Last week his deputy minister, Surendra Hamal, publicly said that Shrestha had accepted 200,000 rupees (2,597 dollars) from a factory owner in southwestern Nepal in exchange for authorisation to increase his production output.
""I have tendered my resignation to the prime minister in the context of showing my cooperation to him,"" Shrestha told AFP.
""The reality and the truth behind the conspiracy will be known to the people in due course of time.""
As Shrestha informed parliament of his decision to resign, he said he was the victim of a ""character assassination"" and the corruption charge was baseless.
The accusation came after Shrestha had criticised Hamal for violating the civil service code during the transfer of a number of ministry officials.
Hours after Shrestha stepped down, Hamal too tendered his resignation, radio reports said.
Both resignations were accepted by King Gyanendra.
Shrestha said he was resigning because he did not want to add to the instability in Nepal.
The country has been under emergency rule since November in order to combat an increasingly violent Maoist rebellion and the prime minister has appealed to all parties to work together.
""The country's situation is so delicate that everybody including the opposition party leaders have to stand unitedly in a platform and jointly fight against the Maoist terrorists,"" Shrestha said.
Some 2,600 people have died during the six-year Maoist insurgency.

Two other people were injured, the official said.
In nearby Khadpo, a bomb exploded as four schoolboys were returning after picking up government identification cards from the district office, killing one of them.
The official said the boys noticed the Maoists' red hammer-and-sickle flag flying near the area of the blast.
""The Maoists wanted to create panic in the area so they planted the bomb,"" he said.
The attacks came one day after the Maoists launched their deadliest attack in their six-year armed campaign to topple the constitutional monarchy, overrunning three police posts in the southwestern Dang district.
Some 84 policemen were among the 164 dead, according to police there.
Another three children were seriously injured in a blast Friday in adjacent Sankhuwa Sabha district.
The official said the Maoists had intended Friday's bomb to target the residence of Rameswore Ghimire, a local leader of the ruling Nepali Congress party.

Businesses and schools remained closed, but no violence was reported, said police officials in the capital, Katmandu.
International flights were operating on schedule and special buses guarded by police officers ferried tourists from their hotels to the airport.
Armed soldiers patrolled the deserted streets of Katmandu and checked bags carried by people out in public. Dozens of suspects have been taken into custody by police to efforts to prevent violence.
The rebels backed their call for a strike with the threat of violence. Most Nepalese do not support the insurgents, who often call for strikes to disrupt life and show their strength, but they have in the past attacked citizens who defy their orders.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, said they wanted the three-day strike to protest appointment of a pro-monarchist prime minister.
In October, King Gyanendra dismissed the elected government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand to the post. Deuba was fired after he moved to postpone parliamentary elections for one year, citing security concerns.
The six-year Maoist insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people, most of them after the king imposed a state of emergency in November last year and ordered the army to join the police in fighting the rebels. The emergency was lifted in August.

A declaration issued at the end of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Kathmandu said the seven member countries' leaders 'affirmed their determination to redouble efforts, collectively as well as individually, to prevent and suppress terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.'
It said they agreed that terrorism 'constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security in the 21st century' and that it 'cannot be justified on ideological, political, religious or any other ground.'
The leaders emphasized the need for urgent conclusion of a Comprehensive Convention on Combating International Terrorism.
They 'called on all states to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts by criminalizing the collection of funds for such acts and refraining from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in states or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts.'
On Saturday's opening session, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee demanded in a speech that Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf prove its sincerity toward India 'by not permitting any activity in Pakistan or any territory in its control today which enables terrorists to perpetrate mindless violence in India.'
He criticized Pakistan for making unfulfilled promises in the past to curb terrorism, citing the December 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane, last October's attack on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in the Indian-administered city of Srinagar and last month's attack on the Indian Parliament as cases in point.
India-Pakistan relations have nose-dived in the wake of the Dec. 13 suicide attack in New Delhi, which India has blamed on Pakistan-supported militant groups.
India's foreign minister, Jiswant Singh, later Saturday had called on Pakistan to formally renounce terrorism and act against accused terrorists living freely in Pakistan, some of them wanted Indian criminals, saying, 'Words of friendship must be accompanied by acts of friendship.'
New Delhi says Pakistan-based Islamic militants fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir are terrorists, while Islamabad calls the separatists 'freedom fighters.'
Musharraf said in his speech Saturday that Pakistan 'abhors violence' and is 'determined to eliminate terrorism.'
But he said it is 'important that a distinction is maintained between acts of legitimate resistance and freedom struggles on the one hand and acts of terrorism on the other.'

No decision was announced at the end of the meeting, but an official source said the emergency was unlikey to be brought back.
""The Nepalese government has no intention of extending the emergency on its own. However, if the situation forces the government and if all the parties agree to extend it then the government will consider it,"" the source said.
Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka told state radio: ""We will seek the opinion of the opposition and work accordingly on whether to extend the emergency.""
Ten months of emergency rule ended August 28 and the Maoists have since stepped up their attacks, planting a number of small bombs in the normally peaceful Kathmandu, including two that were defused safely on Wednesday, and launching massive assaults at the weekend.
Thousands of the guerrillas, who want to topple the constitutional monarchy, bombed and torched a police and army post, government offices and a bank Sunday in the town of Sandhikharka, 215 kilometres (135 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
The seven-hour battle left dead 65 policemen and soldiers and 31 injured. Another policeman died of his wounds Wednesday, state radio said.
In a new toll given Wednesday by the radio, 194 Maoists were killed. Their bodies were either buried in impromptu graves or scattered around the jungle area, they said.
On Saturday, the Maoists lined up and shot dead 49 policemen captured in a raid by 1,000 rebels at Bhimad in eastern Sindhuli district, 85 kilometres (53 miles) east of Kathmandu.
Nine rebels were killed in the attack, according to the defence ministry.
The exact tolls from the attacks in the isolated areas were impossible to verify independently.
On Wednesday the defence ministry said another 21 rebels were killed in four different districts across the country.
Deuba on Tuesday went to Sandhikharka and to Pokhara, the kingdom's second city, to meet with security officials.
""On his trip he discussed with local authorities ways to control the Maoists. He told them that if necessary they can impose curfews under existing anti-terrorism laws even without the emergency,"" an official close to Deuba said.
The cabinet meeting came as the world marked the one year anniversary of the September 11 attacks in the United States.
Deuba after the assault told Washington that US warplanes were free to use Nepal's airspace and presented the crackdown on the Maoists as part of the global ""war on terrorism.""
""We will wipe out terrorism from Nepal. We will defeat terrorism. We will also make the security forces more efficient and effective by providing them with better arms and equipment,"" Deuba told reporters Tuesday.
The United States, Britain and India have all promised military aid to Nepal for its crackdown on the Maoists.
The insurgency has claimed more than 4,700 lives since the Maoists declared their ""people's war"" in February 1996, according to official figures.
The emergency, which gives officials more leeway to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists, was first imposed on November 26, 2001, two days after the rebels broke a four-month truce with Deuba's government.
It was extended three months later by parliament but when it came up for renewal again in May it faced staunch opposition.
King Gyanendra dissolved parliament on Deuba's advice before it could vote and decreed a three-month extension to the emergency.
Deuba's opponents within the ruling Nepali Congress blasted the move and the party has since effectively split into two. Elections for a new parliament have been called for November 13.

""I did what all other political parties wanted me to do and now they must support me,"" Deuba said, addressing supporters at his residence. He continued to insist that his ouster was unconstitutional.
Deuba would not say what his next move would be, but Nepal's constitution has no provision for challenging the king's decision in court.
Deuba's dismissal along with his Cabinet came as a surprise. It was the first time since the end of Nepal's absolute monarchy in 1990 that a king has ousted an elected government and its leader.
The move threatened to trigger a fresh crisis in the insurgency-wracked Himalayan nation, where Gyanendra assumed the throne after the previous king and eight members of the royal family were gunned down last year by the crown prince, who then took his own life.
About 500 people marched through the streets of Katmandu on Sunday in support of the king's decision. The rally, organized by a little-known group called Rastriyabadi Milan Kendra, or national friendship center, was peaceful and was escorted by police.
""Long live the king. We welcome the royal action,"" the demonstrators chanted.
Gyanendra said Friday he would hold executive powers until a new government is formed and postponed the elections, which were scheduled for Nov. 13.
He said a new government would be installed soon and set a five-day timeframe for political parties to recommend officials who might head a caretaker government.
Police said Sunday that Nepal's anti-corruption body had ordered the house arrest of two dismissed Cabinet ministers suspected of taking kickbacks and making illegal deals.
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority issued the order against Chiranjivi Wagle, the minister for physical planning in the dismissed Cabinet, and Jaya Prakash Gupta, the information and communication minister, police said.
Both Wagle and Gupta have denied the corruption allegations.
Politicians tried Sunday to sort out the sudden changes. ""We are continuing to meet with other political parties on assessing the situation and deciding on what our next move should be,"" said Bharat Mohan Adhikari of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.
""We are hopeful that all the parties will reach some kind of consensus in a situation of crisis,"" Adhikari said.
Deuba's support had been dwindling before his ouster. Last week, he lost his claim to leadership of the Nepali Congress, the country's largest political party, which has won most elections since democracy was restored in 1990. He formed a breakaway faction named Nepali Congress (Democratic).

Forecasters warned of more rain to come in a monsoon season that has caused 911 deaths in Nepal, India and Bangladesh while displacing or isolating 25 million people since June.
In China, the death toll from landslides caused by torrential rains in southwestern Yunnan province has risen to 52, official media reported Saturday. Another 41 people are missing in the disasters Wednesday in the remote counties of Yanjin and Xinping. Altogether, more than 900 people have died in China this year due to seasonal storms.
Floods have killed 330 people in India, the latest when a boat sank Friday in a rising river in Bihar state. The accident happened in Khagariya district, 90 miles northwest of Patna, the state capital, Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Ram Vichar Rai told The Associated Press.
The state's water department said that intermittent rains Friday and Saturday had kept most rivers dangerously high and that more rains were expected.
As most of India struggles with the worst drought in years, heavy rains and flooding have destroyed about 2.5 million acres of crops and disrupted the lives of more than 15 million people in 7,825 villages in Bihar, which is along the eastern Himalayan foothills. At least 276 people have died in the state.
In northern Bangladesh, the Jamuna River overflowed and spilled into dozens of villages Saturday, relief officials said. At least 2,000 people had to flee or were stranded by high water, they said.
The flooding was in Sirajganj district, 65 miles northwest of the capital, Dhaka, and officials said thousands of people in the area already were homeless because of earlier floods.
There were no reports of new casualties in Bangladesh, where at least 157 people have been killed and nearly 7 million displaced since June.
Weather officials have forecast more rains and more flooding in Bangladesh and India. But in Nepal, where 424 people have already died in this year's round of rains, the weather has improved in recent days and there were no reports of new damage or deaths.

"418",20021491,"Title: Nepal Cabinet ministers defy party order, back prime minister.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Most of Nepal's Cabinet ministers defied orders from their party to quit the government and announced their support Friday for the embattled prime minister, deepening the nation's political crisis.
The ruling Nepali Congress party on Thursday suspended Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba from its ranks after he asked the king to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections without the party's consent.
The party warned all Cabinet ministers to stop supporting Deuba and resign within three days. Three Cabinet ministers resigned Thursday, but the remaining 33 ministers issued a statement Friday offering ""full support for the prime minister.""
Deuba asked King Gyanendra to order new elections for Nov. 13 after he was unable to get the party's support in parliament for extending a national state of emergency to fight communist rebels. The emergency lapses Saturday after six months.
Deuba remains prime minister until the elections, but will not be able to campaign as a member of the Nepali Congress party.
Under the emergency, soldiers and police have extensive powers to detain people they suspect of supporting the rebels, who have fought since 1996 to end the monarchy and install a communist government.
Since the emergency was imposed on Nov. 26, the military says some 1,800 rebels have been killed in army sweeps of their mountain hide-outs. That is more than half of the 3,500 people killed during the entire insurgency. It is difficult to confirm death claims.
Feuds within the Nepali Congress party have produced three changes of prime minister in as many years. The current squabble comes at a difficult time for the kingdom, which is still recovering from last summer's killing of King Birendra and most of his family in a palace massacre committed by the crown prince.
Deuba heads one faction of the Nepali Congress. The party has governed the Himalayan kingdom for most of the 12 years since democracy was restored and the absolute monarchy was limited under the constitution.
The other faction is headed by the party president, Girija Prasad Koirala, the former prime minister who was ousted when Deuba took over the post last July.

"419",20021361,"Title: Nepal growth sinks, income drops on Maoist insurgency, September 11.rtf; Date: July 8, 2002 Monday; Text: Maoist insurgency and the aftershocks of September 11 have taken a toll on the Nepali economy, pushing incomes lower and sapping growth, according to a report Monday.
Low growth and a weak Nepalese rupee helped push the kingdom's per capita income down to 226 dollars, from 240 last year, officials said in an economic survey.
Gross domestic product likely grew just 0.8 percent in the fiscal year ending July 15.
The estimates are based on figures from the first eight months of the year.  GDP increased 4.8 percent in the 2000-2001 fiscal year, while the finance minister had projected 6.0 percent growth this year - 7.0 percent if the agriculture sector is excluded.
Non-agricultural growth was put at only 0.2 percent in the closing fiscal year, while agricultural production was projected at just 1.7 percent.
The figures come just ahead of caretaker Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's 2002-2003 budget on Monday.
Nepal's population increased 2.02 percent to 23.21 million, said the government.
Economists said tourism, the main earner of foreign currency in Nepal, was devastated after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, which also hit Nepal's export market.
Total trade accounted for 104.77 billion rupees (1.4 billion dollars) in the current fiscal year, down 8.26 percent from 2000-2001.
Tourist arrivals have dropped by nearly half since June 1, 2001, when 10 members of the royal family were killed in a palace massacre carried out by the crown prince. The recovering industry was set back again in November, when Maoist rebels broke a four-month ceasefire and launched attacks with a new ferocity.
More than 4,300 people are believed to have died in the land of Mount Everest since 1996, when the Maoists started their armed campaign to topple the constitutional monarchy.
The survey said inflation was three percent in 2001-2002. Foreign exchange reserves were 1.33 billion dollars, with 73.3 percent of it in convertible currency. The figure would cover the cost of imports for more than 10 months.
Deuba will present the annual budget before Nepal's National Planning Commission rather than the parliament, which was disbanded in late May. Elections are due in November, two years ahead of schedule.
The budget is expected to include about 205 million dollars in defense spending, a rise of about 25 percent from last year, to fight the Maoists.
Meanwhile, the country's politics are in turmoil, with the rivalry between Deuba and his predecessor Girija Prasad Koirala effectively breaking in two the ruling Nepali Congress party.
The main opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) jumped on the economic report as evidence of the Congress' failure on the economic realm.
""I think the low economic growth was all due to the inefficiency of the Deuba government and the Nepali Congress government before Deuba's rule,"" said senior NCP-UML leader Bharat Mohan Adhikari, a former finance minister.

China, which says it regards the Maoist rebels as terrorists, has pledged support in the fight against the six-year insurgency, but has not specified what kind of help it would provide.
Queen Komal and nearly 50 government officials, businessmen and journalists are traveling with Gyanendra on the goodwill tour aimed at strengthening the Himalayan kingdom's relations with its giant neighbor.
It is Gyanendra's second visit to a foreign country since he was enthroned a year ago following the assassination of his elder brother, King Birendra, in a palace massacre committed by the late crown prince.
Last month, Gyanendra visited India, receiving assurances of more help against the Maoist rebels who have been fighting since 1996 to end Nepal's constitutional monarchy. The conflict has killed more than 4,000 people.
""The Chinese government will provide support within our capacity on the basis of the principle of noninterference in Nepal's internal affairs,"" the Chinese ambassador in Katmandu, Wu Congyong, said in an interview with a local magazine.
""The Maoists are just misusing our great leader's name. We call them anti-government terrorists,"" the July issue of Spotlight magazine quoted Congyong as saying.
Gyanendra is also expected to discuss trade and business ties during his visit, the Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported Tuesday.
""We must now focus on the economic cooperation, especially in the private sectors of the two sides,"" Gyanendra was quoted as saying in a Xinhua interview.

"422",20022542,"Title: Nepal Marks Royal Massacre.rtf; Date: June 1, 2002 Saturday; Text: The people of Nepal - jarred a year ago by the massacre of the royal family of this Himalayan kingdom - marked the anniversary Saturday with quiet tributes, a photo exhibit of the slain royals and a planned rally by schoolchildren.
Nepal's people seemed to have shaken off the worst of the June 1 tragedy, when Crown Prince Dipendra gunned down his parents - King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya - and seven other members of the royal family before shooting himself to death.
In the days after the massacre, rioting and violent protests rocked Nepal's cities as people refused to accept that their popular king had been gunned down by his son. Many insisted there was a conspiracy.
But government investigators later said that Dipendra, drunk and drugged, grabbed a machine gun and shot and killed members of his family at a royal dinner. Dipendra reportedly had a running feud with his mother over his choice of bride. The queen had disapproved of the woman the prince wanted to marry.
Like many Nepalese, members of the royal family use only one name.
Birendra's brother, Gyanendra, was crowned the new monarch after the killings and has since been accepted by the people.
""People have been forced to accept the reality and are moving on with their lives,"" said Basanta Pandey, a court clerk.
The anniversary comes amid a surge in fighting between the government and rebels, who launched their insurgency to overthrow the constitutional monarchy in 1996. More than 3,500 people have died in the fighting since then. The military says nearly 1,800 rebels and hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since a cease-fire ended in November, although casualty figures are difficult to confirm.
On Saturday, newspapers carried advertisements in memory of the slain king and schoolchildren were to hold rallies in memory of the king in the capital, Katmandu, on Sunday.
A photo exhibition on the slain king drew hundreds of people in Katmandu. Royal physician Dr. Khagendra Bahadur Shrestha, who was a close confidant of Birendra for three decades, displayed 166 photographs of the king and the royal family, which most Nepalis had never seen before.
""It does not matter who is on the throne, but monarchy is an institution that brings all the Nepalis together,"" said Sudha Singh, a nurse who visited the royal palace on Saturday.
Nepal has a multiparty democracy and an elected government with the prime minister as its chief executive. The king is the constitutional figurehead.

The extent of Thursday's fighting became apparent only after journalists reached the remote towns in western Nepal Saturday where helpless officials and residents narrated horrific tales of being overrun by thousands of guerrillas armed with rocket launchers and automatic rifles.
""They are so ferocious that they killed officers … even after they surrendered,"" said police Inspector Padam Vohra. ""They were stripped naked, then paraded, and finally beheaded with khukris,"" he said, referring to the traditional Nepali knives.
According to the accounts of officials and residents, the rebels mounted a well-planned attack, raiding four towns almost simultaneously, killing a total of at least 100 policemen and six civilians. At least 60 rebels were also killed.
It was the worst single night of violence in the Maoist insurgency, which erupted in 1996 seeking to replace the constitutional monarchy in this poor landlocked Himalayan kingdom with communist rule. The insurgency has claimed more than 3,000 lives.
The towns attacked are in Dang district, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
The main target was the two-story house of Interior Security Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka in his native town, Satbariya, which was being guarded by 120 paramilitary policemen. Khadka was in Katmandu at the time
Firing grenades, rockets and guns, the rebels fought with police for several hours until early Friday. About 60 policemen were shot to death, said Vohra. He said 27 policemen who surrendered were beheaded and two policemen were burned to death. About 30 survived.
The guerrillas suffered heavy casualties as well.
While retreating, the rebels dumped the bodies of their comrades, half burying them on the side of a dry riverbed a few kilometers (miles) from the minister's house.
Saturday, at least 60 bodies of rebels could be seen strewn about.
""We are not equipped to fight them. We have only the .303 rifles, which cannot match their rocket launchers,"" said Thawran Thaket, a senior police head constable.
Before retreating, the guerrillas set fire to the minister's house.
On Saturday, policemen were sweeping away the spent cartridges and shells of rocket-fired grenades littering the floor along with shards of broken glass and bits of policemen's camouflage uniforms. Twisted and blackened bicycles stood in one corner of the compound. Two burned out cars were parked outside the barbed wire and 10-feet (3-meter) boundary wall.
In a similar raid, the guerrillas attacked a bank and a police station - a pink two-story building perched on a hill - in the nearby Lamahi town, killing 11 policemen and wounding 15.
""They suddenly started firing with grenades and rocket launchers. They struck at four places,"" said Hari Pratap Keshi, a resident.
""They looted the bank, then the army helicopter came, so they fled and returned a little while later. It was like in the movies,"" he said.

Recently, he was visited by people looking for something much more sinister.
Hussain's Intrigue Jewelers kiosk in suburban Pittsburgh was one of several across the nation searched by FBI agents hunting for ties to the al-Qaida terrorist network.
""They took everything, my paperwork, bills, my computer, my checks,"" said Hussain, 27, a recently discharged U.S. Army mechanic. ""I told them, 'I don't have any links to anything like that.""'
About 75 stores have been searched by investigators hoping to discover financial backing for terrorist groups, said a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The raids have taken place in several cities over the past two weeks, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and New York. Dozens of foreigners, mostly from Pakistan, have been detained or questioned.
The shop owners have been asked about their accounting practices and whether they send money to any foreign organizations on a regular basis. They also are asked whether they support al-Qaida or know anyone who does, officials said.
Immigration attorney Neil Rambana, who is representing three Pakistani men and a woman from Nepal arrested in a raid at the Governor's Square mall in Tallahassee, Fla., said the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service were on a ""fishing expedition.""
""There is no proof and no one has presented any evidence that would put these people under suspicion,"" Rambana said. ""This was all about abusing people's rights in the hopes that there were a few guilty people among them.""
The Immigration and Naturalization Service declined to comment on the raids, other than to acknowledge they had taken place. A U.S. official said more than a dozen people are still in detention following the raids.
Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said immediately after the raids that federal agencies were ""looking at illegal immigrants working at kiosks,"" but he refused to elaborate.
The largest raids took place between June 28 and July 2. Agents swept jewelry stores in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina. Since then, smaller raids have taken place in Texas, California and Massachusetts, officials said.
Most of the raids involved Intrigue Jewelers franchises, which are licensed through Gold Concept Inc., a Florida company owned by Orlando businessman Arif Rajan.
Rajan's attorney, Phillip Calandrino, said neither the company nor its owner have terrorist ties.
He said Rajan, a native of Pakistan and a U.S. citizen since 1991, has been cooperating with the FBI for several months and has voluntarily turned over company records to investigators.
""He is just like any small businessman that you might run into. He didn't do anything wrong,"" Calandrino said.
Calandrino said Gold Concept leases space for its franchisees, but doesn't supply jewelry and doesn't control the day-to-day operations of the businesses.
""They hire who they want. They do what they want, like any independent business,"" he said.
The company first came into contact with FBI investigators in September, Calandrino said, when an Intrigue Jewelers employee in Whitehall, Pa., came under suspicion for having spent hours photographing the World Trade Center days before it was destroyed.
Ashar Iqubal Butt, a Pakistani citizen, pleaded guilty in June to entering the country with an altered British passport and agreed to be deported. A judge delayed his sentencing until September to give agents more time to investigate Butt's 25 World Trade Center photographs, which he had developed the week of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Butt's lawyer has said the photographs were taken innocently and that Butt had come to the United States to work.
The raids have sparked outrage among some members of Muslim communities.
""These people are being confronted and in some cases terrorized based on no evidence,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""And even when the FBI says there is evidence, it is never anything anyone else is allowed to see.""

Deuba said he needed the extension to keep up the fight against rebels trying to topple the Himalayan kingdom's constitutional monarchy and install a communist government.
The guerrillas, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, attacked government offices and a small airport in Achham on Sunday, killing 77 policemen, 55 soldiers, an intelligence officer and four civilians.
The rebels broke off peace talks and renewed attacks Nov. 26, prompting the imposition of the state of emergency, which is up for renewal. Also, King Gyanendra ordered the army to fight the rebels, a task left previously to the overmatched police force.
Deuba said the state of emergency was showing results.
""The situation in country has gotten better since the emergency was imposed and such a task takes time. So it is our compulsion to continue mobilization of the security forces,"" Deuba told Parliament.
The Parliament melee started when a member of the governing Nepali Congress party, representing the town of Mangalsen where the main attack took place, said the government ignored warnings that violence was coming. Another attack took place at the airport in the nearby town of Sanphebaga.
""Representatives and government officials from the area had warned the government about the possible attack. But it was ignored,"" Ram Bahadur Bista said.
Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khadka, the area's administrative chief, wrote several letters to the government seeking additional security forces, Bista said. Khadka died in the attack.
""The government has failed to provide security and prevent the attack, despite having information about the possible assault. It has now lost all moral ground to continue in power,"" said Pradeep Nepal of the main opposition United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal.
Deuba said the army has sent reinforcements by helicopter to the Achham district, 375 miles northwest of the capital Katmandu. He said the military had taken control of the area and people were beginning to come out of their homes.
The emergency measures restrict freedom of the press, assembly, expression and movement and allow suspects to be detained for three weeks without charge.
Deuba raised the death toll to 137 from 129, adding a policeman and seven soldiers to the casualty list.
The attacks came as the impoverished Himalayan nation was still coming to terms with the June palace massacre of King Birendra and eight other royals by Crown Prince Dipendra, who then shot himself. Nepal is a constitutional monarchy.
Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory to warn Americans about travel in Nepal after the guerrillas staged attacks near popular tourist destinations, including the main entry point for the Mount Everest trek. The latest attacks were not near tourist sites.
More than 2,400 people have died in fighting since 1996.
The rebels have called a general strike Friday and Saturday to commemorate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency.

"431",20021510,"Title: Nepal army says nearly 3,000 Maoist rebels killed since November.rtf; Date: October 1, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Nearly 3,000 Maoist rebels have been killed by government troops since November, the Royal Nepalese Army said Tuesday, but the rebels continue to strike the capital, as they did last week.
""At least 2,820 Maoist terrorists have been killed since November, when the army was ordered against them, but despite the huge damage, the threat has not decreased,"" army spokesman Col. Deepak Gurung said.
Gurung said the army had lost 205 men in the fighting.
Last year, the army was ordered for the first time to help police fight the rebels after King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency in this Himalayan nation on Nov. 26, after the rebels ended peace talks and resumed attacks on government targets and troops.
Human rights groups have raised questions about army and government casualty reports in battles in remote mountain regions. The groups are concerned that civilians may have been killed in the crossfire.
Gurung said the army's setbacks in trying to end the insurgency were due to intelligence failures. The army has been under criticism for failing to gather advance warning of attacks by the rebels, who attack in groups of hundreds, moving on foot across mountain terrain.
""We admit there has been lack of intelligence on our part and we are doing all we can to overcome this situation,"" he told a news briefing.
There has not been any independent confirmation of the casualty figures. The rebels, who operate from remote areas, cannot normally be contacted and rarely comment on government claims.
The army said it has formed a Human Rights Cell at its headquarters in Katmandu and it will be extended to regional branches across the nation.
""We will be investigating on each and every case of violation of human rights that we come across and we will hold classes to sensitize the force about human rights,"" said Gen. Kumar Sharma, who is heading the unit.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to impose communist rule based on the tenets of the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
They intensified their attacks after the government lifted a state of emergency in August to allow free campaigning ahead of parliamentary elections in November. Police said rebels attacked two schools in the capital last week, vandalizing offices, burning buses and leaving behind bombs. The rebels' youth wing called for a two-day strike this week that has shut down all schools and colleges.
The Maoist rebels have offered a cease-fire, but the government has rejected the move as a ploy by the insurgents to gain time to regroup.

Gyanendra appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime minister on Oct. 11, a week after he sacked the Himalayan kingdom's democratically elected leader.
The decision angered most politicians, who said the king had not consulted them about the decision to appoint Chand, who's party had only 12 members in the dissolved 300-member legislature.
The king fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba saying he was incapable of holding elections in the country on Nov. 13. Deuba's dismissal came after he sought to postpone the elections citing threats of disruption by Maoist rebels.
""All the parties had different opinions and we were unable to reach an understanding,"" said Khadga Prasad Oli, a member of the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party.
He said party leaders would meet again Friday.
Nepal's king is the country's constitutional leader and though he has the authority to dismiss the elected government, many believe he went too far in firing Deuba and may have violated the constitution in appointing Chand.
""The king's actions has made the political situation complex and uncertain … we need to join our efforts to bring it back into the constitutional track,"" said Arjun Narsingh, a spokesman for the Nepali Congress party, the country's largest party.

At least three anti-government guerrillas were gunned down Thursday on the spot in Surkhet district, while another four were killed Wednesday in Dang district, all located in western Nepal, the radio quoted a press release issued by the Defense Ministry as saying.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fires with the government security forces, the press release said, adding that the government forces also seized some arms, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations in those districts.
More than 1,000 guerrillas and over 300 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 4, 000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were all rejected by the government.

"434",20022474,"Title: Government's plans to extend emergency rule in Nepal runs into trouble.rtf; Date: May 20, 2002 Monday; Text: The government's plan to extend emergency rule ran into trouble on Monday when a faction within the ruling Nepali Congress party declared it may vote against the proposal in Parliament this week.
The faction, which controls half the Congress party, said it was angry at Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for not reaching a consensus within the party, before the Cabinet announced last week it had decided to extend the six-month-long emergency until the end of November.
Emergency rule was imposed Nov. 26 after Maoist guerrillas withdrew from stalemated peace talks and renewed their six-year war against government forces.
The state of emergency suspends press freedom and allows soldiers and police to detain people without charge on suspicion that they support or sympathize with the Maoists' goals of ending the monarchy and redistributing land.
Since the rebels began their violent campaign in 1996, more than 3,500 people have been killed. More than half have died during the past five months as the army began sweeping rebel hide-outs.
At Deuba's request, King Gyanendra has called a Parliament session for May 23 to consider the extension of the emergency, due to lapse on Saturday.
""The party has been reiterating that emergency rule should be avoided as far as possible and should keep the door open for peace talks,"" said Arjun Narsingh, a spokesman for the Nepali Congress party.
The government needs the support of two-thirds of the 205-member House of Representatives, the lower house of Parliament, to extend the emergency.
The governing Nepali Congress has 113 members and Deuba controls only half of them. The other half is loyal to his predecessor, Girija Prasad Koirala, who is also the president of the party.
""The government has failed to get the approval of the party before moving ahead with the proposal and Prime Minister Deuba has violated party discipline by stepping over the party's authorities,"" said Shiv Kumar Basnet, a lawmaker from the dissident faction.
Besides convincing his own party members, Deuba needs the support of the main opposition, the United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, which has said it is waiting for the government to provide ample reasons for extending the emergency.
""We have always been in favor of nonviolent resolution to the problem and still believe that peace talks are the only way out of the whole mess,"" said Jhalnath Khanal, a member of the communist party.

The Bhiman police outpost in Sindhuli district, about 150 kilometers southeast of Kathmandu, was manned by 73 policemen when the rebels attack took place around midnight Saturday, Minister of State for Home Affairs Devendraraj Kanel told reporters.
The bodies of two rebels in combat dress were also recovered from the site, Kanel said after returning from a visit to the site.
Government-run Radio Nepal has earlier Sunday reported that 40 policemen were killed and 19 injured in the attack, while 14 others were missing and their fate was unknown.
The report had said the attack by a large number of insurgents took place around midnight Saturday and lasted for four hours.
The rebels had blocked the roads leading to the outpost by felling trees before carrying out their attack.
The attack was the most significant since a state of emergency that the government imposed last November to battle the communist rebellion expired on Aug. 28.
The rebels are fighting to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy.
Elsewhere in the country, rebels killed two security personnel and one political worker in different attacks on Saturday.
The rebels also blasted a municipal office building at Madhyapur, Thimi, about 20 km east of Kathmandu. No one was reported injured.

The deaths took place in the eastern Sindhupalchowk district on Saturday.
""A gang of armed Maoists abducted a former policeman from his home in Khamare and then hacked him to death while two others were killed on Saturday in the same area,"" police said.
Meanwhile police arrested two student activists of the pro Maoist All Nepal National Free Students Union (ANNFSU) from a house in Kathmandu on Monday, police sources said.
The two, identified as Atindra Neupane and Sangita Khadka, were on the police wanted list.
Police had already rounded up over 400 leftist students and others activists last month ahead of a five-day strike called by the Maoists, to prevent any untoward incidents, the sources said.
More than 4,000 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their armed struggle for a communist republic in 1996.

The attack comes a day after rebels of the outlawed People's War Group (PWG) bombed a bus in the state, killing 14 people and injuring 17.
Wednesday's attack took place at Tumalacheruvu railway station in the state's Guntur district, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Hyderabad.
""Around 40 people came to the Tumalacheruvu station at around 1.30 in the morning (2000 GMT Tuesday) and asked the five or six people on duty to vacate the premises. Then they blasted the building, which has totally collapsed, but the train track is still safe,"" railway spokesman P. Krishnaya told AFP.
The latest rebel assault comes in the wake of stepped-up action by the police against the PWG. The fresh wave of violence has left nearly two dozen people dead in the last 10 days.
""The police have been cracking down on the rebels so they are resorting to subversive activities in a hollow show of strength. The authorities have them on the run,"" Andhra Pradesh Home Minister Devendra Goud told AFP.
Damodaran Gautam Sawang, police chief of Andhra Pradesh's Maoist-dominated Warangal district, said that despite facing the heat from the crackdown the rebels still had hideouts in seven Indian states leading to neighbouring Nepal.
The Himalayan country is wracked by an increasingly violent Maoist insurgency to topple the monarchy.
""There are easy getaways and safe hideouts for the Maoists in a red corridor which stretches from here to the Indian states of Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Maharashtra and West Bengal right up to neighbouring Nepal,"" said Damodaran.
""It is becoming a big problem for us.""
The PWG, which has a Maoist-Leninist ideology, was created in 1980. It has been waging an armed rebellion for the creation of a communist state comprising tribal areas of the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.
The group generally targets feudal landlords whom they hold responsible for the exploitation of the poor.

A group of 20 Maoists ambushed a routine security patrol Tuesday morning in Bhaktapur, sparking a gun-battle in which six rebels were killed and the others believed injured, an army official said.
""This is the first time as many as six Maoist terrorists were killed in a clash near the capital Kathmandu,"" he said.
He said the band of rebels had been ""preparing terrorist activities"" in the area when they attacked the security forces, who did not sustain casualties.
Bhaktapur is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northeast of the capital inside the Kathmandu valley.
Elsewhere, two Maoists were killed late Monday in a clash with security forces in Siraha district, 190 kilometers (118 miles) south of Kathmandu, the official said.
Rebels also killed a local leader of the kingdom's ruling Nepali Congress party in Rautahat district, 240 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, a home ministry official said.
Gagan Dev Yadav was shot at close range by a group of eight Maoists as he rode a three-wheel taxi in Prempur Gagani locality. He died later in hospital, the official said.
More than 4,200 people have been killed since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996, according to official count.
Most of the deaths have come since the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire in November. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has ruled out any fresh negotiations until the Maoists lay down their arms.

Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dissolved parliament in May and called elections for November 13 to resolve a feud between rival factions of the ruling Nepali Congress party vying for control.
""Unless the government is able to guarantee us full security arrangements during the parliamentary election we will not be able to decide if there will be an election,"" Chief Election Commissioner Achyut Narayan Rajbhandari told reporters on Monday.
Election officials face threats from Maoist rebels who have been fighting to abolish constitutional monarchy and democracy in this Himalayan nation since 1996. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
Fighting between the government and Maoist rebels has intensified in recent months, with the army joining police in a campaign to root out rebel fighters from strongholds in remote mountainous areas.
The commission and the government also disagree on how the election should be organized.
Prime Minister Deuba said last week the election would be held in five phases.

The regionwide flooding, fed by monsoon rains, has killed 445 people in Bangladesh, Nepal and India this month, stranded or displaced 12.5 million and made life more burdensome for uncounted others along the pathways of the region's rivers.
Floods during the monsoon season are annual events in South Asia, and Bangladesh, a nation of 130 million people, is hit by devastating floods and cyclones every few years.
Dr. Shahidul Islam of Shaktipur now commutes to his medical practice by boat over flooded rice fields to a roadside spot where he leaves his motorcycle for the final leg to neighboring Shazadpur, 105 kilometers (65 miles) northeast of the capital Dhaka.
""Boats are now the only available transport in our flooded village,"" said Islam, 54.
Many village men, who in normal times work as farm hands or weavers, have been ferrying people in boats for as little as 2 takas (less than one cent) per trip since the floods began this month.
""I have been making enough money to buy food for my family. The flood has pushed up the price of food and I have been unable to work,"" said Narayan Biswas, 28, a weaver and father of three small children.
Tin and bamboo houses built atop mounds of earth, and half-submerged trees and electric poles dot the countryside in Shaktipur, now turned into a vast sea of gray by the overflowing Korotoa River.
The highest death toll has been in Nepal, where mudslides have swept away villages, killing 240. In India's Bihar state, 85 people have been killed and 5 million washed out of their homes or stranded. Another seven have died in India's Assam state.
In Bangladesh, where flood waters have covered a third of the low-lying delta country, at least half of the 90 victims have died from drowning, and the others from diarrhea, a waterborne disease.
The flooding - deemed the worst in four years - has submerged or washed away thousands of tin, bamboo or straw houses, and damaged flood barriers, roads and bridges. Vast areas of crop land also have been inundated.
Thousands of homeless villagers have sought shelter on embankments or in schools and mosques, which are often the only concrete buildings in poor Bangladeshi villages.
More flooding was feared in coming days as Bangladesh's 250 rivers continued to swell from fresh rain, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in Dhaka said.
The center said torrential rains and flood waters from the neighboring Indian state of Assam would further feed basins of the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers, two of the world's longest.
At least 30 people have died in Assam in floods that have affected some 2.5 million people. The death toll on Monday rose from seven to an estimated 30 in the northwestern state, though officials said the toll was likely higher.
""Waterborne diseases like gastroenteritis, diarrhea and jaundice … Battling this is our biggest challenge now,"" said Biswaranjan Samal, district magistrate of Dhemaji, one of the worst-hit districts, 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Gauhati, the state capital.
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said communications and transportation were hard hit, making relief efforts difficult.
""The severe disruption in communications due to road or bridges being washed away has slowed the information flow,"" Gogoi told The Associated Press. ""Therefore, several deaths could well have gone unreported to authorities.""

There are stacks of Tibetan books in every room but the kitchen of E. Gene Smith's house here. Many are centuries old, and from the looks of things they are practically nudging Mr. Smith out the door.
     The books are just a fraction of the 12,000 volumes of Buddhist and Buddhist-influenced literature that Mr. Smith began to collect in 1965, when he first went to India and found work in the Library of Congress office in New Delhi. Most of the books were brought by refugees, who had carried them over the Himalayas in their flight from the invading Chinese. 
 Scholars say Mr. Smith's collection of Tibetan literature may be the biggest in the West or even in the world. Universities covet his books, he said, but he has no plans to sell his library.
Instead, he and a few employees of the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center, the nonprofit organization he founded and directs from his home, are trying to have every one of the hundreds of millions of pages scanned onto a computer and made retrievable at no cost on a Web site (tbrc.org). The task should take at least five years, Mr. Smith said. 
The collection includes ""everything under the sun,"" said Tashi Tsering, a scholar from Dharmsala, India, the home of the Dalai Lama. ""Buddhist philosophy. Some of the earliest examples of biography and autobiography in the world. Mathematics. Alchemy. Travelogues -- Tibetans were great travelers and fond of writing about their experiences. A lot of great visionary writing.""
There are also volumes of intensely romantic and ancient exotica. 
""The funeral rites of Kublai Khan,"" Mr. Smith said, pulling one out. ""This is one of the earliest Tibetan wood blocks, printed sometime between 1294 and 1304. And over there, a complete set of the biographies of all the Dalai Lamas, from the 14th century to the 20th.""
Mr. Tsering said Mr. Smith, 65, has put ""all his energy, all his money into this. That's why he doesn't own a house at his age."" 
Mr. Smith agreed, saying: ""I have no kids. I didn't have to send them to college. So really, all my money went into books.""
Mr. Smith was introduced to the language and literature of Tibet as a student at the University of Washington. ""I was looking for things that would keep me out of Vietnam,"" he said. ""I wanted, more than anything, to stay out of the war.""
Young men studying obscure languages could receive draft deferments, so Mr. Smith took Mongolian and Turkish, and -- when a Tibetan lama, or scholar, came to teach -- Tibetan.
From the lama, whose name was Deshung, Mr. Smith learned about the philosophy and world view of Tibetan Buddhism.
""He was the most logical person I have ever encountered,"" Mr. Smith said. ""From him, I learned that truth is true only within its system.""
Eventually, Mr. Smith, who was reared a Mormon, converted to Buddhism.
Deshung, he said, ""was passionate about books. It was his passion, and it became mine."" After five years of graduate study, the lama suggested that Mr. Smith go to India.
""We had no Tibetan books,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Deshung said: 'Go and find them. Find the important books and get them published.' It was his idea, really.""
Experts said the books Mr. Smith found and had published through the Library of Congress eventually became the foundation of Tibetan studies in the United States.
""He was the first Tibet expert. He literally made Tibetan studies possible,"" said Donald Lopez, the chairman of the Asian languages and cultures department at the University of Michigan. 
The Tibetan refugees carried books that had never been available in the West -- ""a vast and self-contained world of literature,"" said Elliot Sperling, a Tibetan professor at Indiana University. ""Tibetans have a great reverence for the written word. It was a very literate civilization for 1,000 years and produced a massive amount of literature.""
In his work for the Library of Congress, Mr. Smith acquired copies of ancient Tibetan books and distributed them to American universities and libraries. 
But acquiring a full range of Tibetan books required detective work and a sweeping knowledge of the literature. There were no printing presses in Tibet. Books were hand-written or printed from wood blocks and kept in libraries in monasteries -- the centers of learning -- and in private homes. But there are no catalogs or comprehensive book lists. 
Each of the four major sects of Tibetan Buddhism also has its own significant literature.
After the Chinese invasion, Mr. Tsering said, books were ""scattered everywhere.""
""You'd have to know which are rare and important in all four major schools,"" he said. ""Otherwise, you'd wind up collecting all the regular, well-known books.""
Mr. Smith consulted with many refugee lamas, including the Dalai Lama, on the most valuable texts and sent researchers to the farthest reaches of India and Nepal to hunt for them. In the process, his knowledge of the literature became ""phenomenal, encyclopedic,"" said Derek Kolleeny, a Tibe"

Three men on two motorcycles placed a bomb on the statue of the late king Mahendra in a Katmandu neighborhood and it detonated a few minutes later.
Police said they suspected that the blast was carried out by Maoist rebels, who have been fighting to end Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
The attack came a day after Nepal's King Gyanendra appointed a monarchist as prime minister. The move angered the country's top politicians and has frightened many democracy supporters in this Himalayan nation.
The announcement to appoint Lokendra Bahadur Chand was made as 4,000 supporters of the two biggest political parties on Friday protested the king's firing last week of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Cabinet.

""Parliament is considering enactment of stern laws to enhance safety and security of investors in Nepal,"" Deuba said.
He did not elaborate.
On a visit to New Delhi, the Nepalese prime minister also sought India's cooperation in fighting Maoist rebels who often take shelter in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, governed by a communist party.
Maoist rebels have been fighting since 1996 to end constitutional monarchy in the Himalayan kingdom and establish a communist state.
The rebels frequently attack government targets. A state of emergency and military clampdown in the past four months has led to hundreds of rebels being killed, but the guerrillas have kept up their attacks. More than 2,800 people have been killed since 1996.
Deuba told a meeting of Indian business leaders that his government would attempt to attract foreign investment by exploiting Nepal's huge hydroelectric power potential from numerous Himalayan rivers and streams.
""We invite you to take part in what will be a win-win situation,"" Deuba said.
India, with its enormous power requirements, is viewed as a natural market for Nepalese hydroelectric power. Investors have been slow to respond, however, mainly due to Maoist threats.

At least nine anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot Sunday in Banke district in western Nepal, while another two were killed in other districts, the press release said.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fires with the government security forces, the press release said, adding that the government security forces arrested 29 anti-government guerrillas.
The government security forces also seized some arms, ammunition and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations in these districts.
More than 1,000 guerrillas and over 300 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four month long ceasefire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 4, 000 lives since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

Most of the residents of the Nepalese village of Thapra in Ramechap district were asleep when the landslide struck early Wednesday, said Lekhnath Pokhrel of the Natural Calamity Management Center.
""Initial reports said that 40 houses were swept away and at least 65 people are reported to be missing and feared killed,"" Pokhrel said.
He said helicopters loaded with relief material and rescuers were waiting at the Katmandu airport for the weather to clear so they could fly to the village, but low visibility and poor light forced rescue efforts to be postponed until Thursday.
The village, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital, Katmandu, is in a remote mountainous area with no roads to nearby towns. People use mountain trails to reach it.
The Himalayan kingdom has been badly hit by annual floods that have devastated large areas of South Asia. More than 25 million people have been displaced or stranded in Nepal, India and Bangladesh since June.
Nearly 500 people have been killed in Nepal and 250,000 left homeless by landslides and floods since the heavy monsoon downpours began. Most have occurred in remote mountainous areas accessible only by helicopter. Other areas have been cut off as torrential rains have washed away roads.
At least five people were killed in Nepal over the weekend when two houses collapsed in two villages near Katmandu.
In neighboring India, at least 10 more people died Tuesday, six of them from waterborne diseases, in the rain-soaked eastern state of Bihar, officials said Wednesday. The deaths raised the statewide toll to 327.
Doctors in more than 475 temporary medical centers in the worst-hit Samastipur, Madhubani, Sitamarhi and Sheohar districts were distributing water purification and anti-diarrheal tablets to stranded villagers, said A.C. Pandey, a relief and rehabilitation department official.
The Bagmati, Kosi and Gandak rivers were beginning to recede, though they were still flowing above the danger mark, Pandey said.
The state government was distributing grain and lentils at more than 650 relief centers to villagers stranded on the roofs of their homes or camping along highways and embankments.
But there appeared to be no immediate relief in sight for the 16 million people hit by the floods in Bihar, with the Central Water Commission on Wednesday forecasting moderate rain over the next 24 hours.
Another 39 people have died in India's northeastern state of Assam.
In Bangladesh, a small girl was killed and five others injured when a mud house collapsed after overnight rain in the southwestern Khulna district, putting the death toll in the country to 158.

Police in Patna, state capital of the eastern Indian state of Bihar, said the arrest early Thursday of Brahmeshwar Singh Mukhiya brought down the curtain on a marathon manhunt for the elusive supremo of the Ranvir Sena private militia.
Additional Police Director General Ashish Ranjan said detectives raided a city hotel and arrested Singh, the alleged mastermind behind the massacres of 61 Hindu peasants in 1996 and 34 others two years later -- the two latest Sena-led carnages.
Sporadic attacks have continued since then in parts of the state, which with more than 5,000 murders, 1,200 armed robberies and thousands of rapes and abductions a year, is India's most lawless.
Mukhiya, who enjoys awesome clout among Bihar's upper-caste feudal landlords, carried a police reward of half a million rupees (10,400 dollars) in connection with more than 500 murders since the Ranvir Sena's inception in the mid-1980s.
Mukhiya's reign of terror was mainly confined to the badlands of central Bihar, where the Sena waged a bloody war of attrition against local Maoist guerrillas, who are now suspected of having links with leftwing rebels in adjacent Nepal.
The Ranvir Sena does not have formally-enrolled guerrillas but finds ready soldiers, in thousands, when it wishes to attack Hindu untouchables or landless farmers in Bihar, India's second most populous state.
The police official said the suspect was being detained in the state's maximum-security Beur prison in the state capital Patna.

Officials say security forces have killed more than 560 rebels since Thursday - a claim that could not be independently confirmed. Neither journalists nor human rights activists have access to the battle zones in remote districts of Rolpa and Pyuthan, 185 miles west of Katmandu.
The reported fighting came hours after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba left for Washington, where he is to meet President Bush on Tuesday to seek more aid to crush the rebels, who are fighting to oust the monarchy from this Himalayan kingdom.
The Bush administration recently asked Congress for $20 million in non-combat military aid for Nepal.
""In yesterday's operations, more than 200 Maoists were killed,"" said the prime minister's spokesman, Achhyut Wagle. The rebels are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
Security forces claimed to have killed more than 360 guerrillas in gunbattles since Thursday, before the air attacks began Sunday night, and acknowledged losing three soldiers and one police officer.
Defense Ministry spokesman Tana Gautam said only 108 bodies had been found since Thursday, adding that rebels often drag away or bury their dead.
""It is very difficult to give precise casualty figures,"" Wagle said. The government estimates are mostly based on circumstantial evidence found by soldiers, such as body parts ""or signs of bloodstained bodies having been dragged away.""
The casualty figures are ""purely speculation,"" said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of Nepal's largest selling newspaper group, Kantipur. ""It depends on circumstantial evidence, like heavy firing from the army side and no response from the rebels, but I am not disputing the figures.""
In London, Amnesty International said it was concerned that civilians were being harmed in the conflict, which has killed more than 3,500 people since 1996.
""It seems like a massacre has taken place. Whether of Maoists or civilians, it's impossible to say,"" said the human right group's Nepal researcher, Ingrid Massage.
Meanwhile, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity that several senior rebel leaders, including at least six members of the group's Central Committee, were among a group surrounded by the army in dense forests of the Rolpa and Pyuthan districts Monday.
The official said that two other top Maoist leaders had escaped, including Krishna Bahadur Mohara, who participated in peace talks before breaking them off and resuming attacks on government forces last November.
That prompted King Gyanendra to order the army into the biggest offensive of the war, which had previously been fought by ill-equipped policemen.
The Maoist insurgency began in Rolpa and Pyuthan, feeding on crippling poverty and poor governance. In many parts of Rolpa and neighboring areas, the rebels ran a parallel administration and courts that provided quick justice.

The government filed a motion Friday seeking extension of the state of emergency at the parliament, which starts a new session on Thursday next week, Information and Communications Minister Jayaprakash Gupta told Kyodo News.
'The cabinet Friday agreed to continue with the state of emergency,' said Gupta, who is also the government spokesman.
The government's decision to seek an extension of the period of emergency followed an all-party meeting that reached a consensus Friday on the extension, he said.
The Nepalese Constitution provides for extension of a state of emergency for up to a maximum of one year.
Gupta said offers by the communist rebels to restart a peace dialogue with the government will not help.
'The statements lack commitment to a peace process and can be dismissed as a mere ploy to cheat the government,' the minister said.
For any meaningful dialogue or peace process to start, the rebels must first disarm themselves, he said.
'They should apologize to the Nepalese people for what they have done to them and the nation, and more importantly, they must express a firm commitment to join Nepal's present multiparty political dispensation,' Gupta said.
The rebels of the Nepal Communist Party launched a violent campaign six years ago to replace Nepal's constitutional monarchy and multiparty rule. More than 4,000 Nepalese have been killed in the armed rebellion.
The government has made significant achievements in battling the insurgency during the past six months, he said.
Nepalese political parties and friendly countries that once considered the rebels revolutionaries advocating the cause of poor Nepalese today call them 'terrorists,' he said.
The government was able to obtain substantial information about the rebels by interrogating more than 8,000 people arrested during the emergency period, the minister said.
More than 5,000 people arrested were released after inquiries.
Troops destroyed 25 workshops that manufactured crude bombs and explosives for the rebels, while demolishing four 'big training centers' which had provided training to some 5,000 rebels, he said.
Before the state of emergency, the rebels openly recruited village youths into their militia, but that has now completely stopped, he added.
The minister said the government offensive against the rebellion has to be continued a while longer, at least until the rebels are forced to enter meaningful peace talks or face total annihilation.

""We have chosen May Day to voice our demand as it is observed as workers' day throughout the world.
I request and urge all sex workers in the world to unite to demand our rights,"" said Swapna Gayen, president of Durbar Mahila Samabbaya Samity, an organization campaigning for the rights of sex workers in Calcutta.
Carrying torches, the sex workers began marching midnight Tuesday through the streets of Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal state and home to one of the biggest prostitute populations in India.
Included were sex workers from neighboring Bangladesh and Nepal, two key suppliers of prostitutes to Indian brothels.
The prostitutes assembled at the city's College Square for a seminar with representatives from several non-governmental organizations on their problems and rights.
Though illegal, prostitution proliferates in India's major cities and along highways.

Musharraf had been due to meet Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Friday at the opening of the summit of leaders from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
Although face-to-face talks have so far been ruled out, it would be their first meeting in six months and the highest level contact between the two nuclear powers since ties sunk to a 30-year low after the December 13 attack on the Indian parliament.
But Musharraf, attending his first SAARC summit since taking power in a bloodless coup in 1999, was delayed by about three hours in China because of heavy fog.
""Because of the Pakistani president's late arrival the summit has been put off,"" a high-ranking Sri Lankan official said.
The summit will now open on Saturday, although all the leaders would attend a banquet hosted later Friday by Nepal's King Gyanendra.
A Pakistani official said a leaders' retreat scheduled for Saturday had been cancelled, erasing one of the few opportunities for Musharraf and Vajpayee to meet privately away from the glare of television cameras.
Musharraf chose to travel via China to the summit after India banned all Pakistani planes from its air space in a series of tit-for-tat measures sparked by the assault on the New Delhi parliament.
In Beijing, Musharraf told Premier Zhu Rongji that ""Pakistan hopes for peace, opposes war, and is willing to work to ease the current tensions (with India) through dialogue,"" China's state Xinhua news agency said.
Vajpayee arrived in the Nepalese capital on Thursday also vowing to pursue peace rather than war.
But he ruled out any face-to-face meeting with Musharraf until Pakistan tightens the noose on anti-Indian Islamic militants, particularly two outfits blamed by New Delhi for the parliament attack which left 14 people dead.
Musharraf, however, said his government ""has already taken and is taking necessary measures to combat terrorism and contain extremism,"" according to Xinhua.
India and Pakistan have massed troops on their border since the parliament attack and exchanged gunfire in Kashmir, the focal point of their half-century rivalry.
New Delhi has also withdrawn its ambassador from Islamabad for the first time since the two countries' last full-blown war in the early 1970s.
Vajpayee and Musharraf last met in July in the Indian city of Agra, where they failed to reach any agreement.
In a sign of a slight easing of tensions, the two countries' foreign ministers shook hands at the start of the two-day meeting of SAARC's top diplomats Wednesday.
But India's Jaswant Singh said Wednesday that Pakistan had made no formal request for talks with him on the margins of the summit.
The SAARC summit -- which represents one-fifth of the world's population and its poorest region -- will be the first since 1998 after being repeatedly delayed by bickering between India and Pakistan.
It comes amid diplomatic moves to prevent regional tensions deteriorating with the arrival on Thursday in Bangladesh by British Prime Minister Tony Blair for talks with his counterpart Khaleda Zia. He will travel on to India and Pakistan.
The United States, which has counted on both Pakistan and India in its military campaign in Afghanistan, has also urged a cooling of tempers, while acknowledging India's right of self-defense following the parliament attack.
The summit is also being attended by the leaders of the five other members -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
SAARC leaders are also due to use the summit to explore ways to boost trade, curb the sexual exploitation of women and children and eradicate rampant poverty.

"457",200281,"Title: PRACTICAL TRAVELER When Caution Is Advised.rtf; Date: April 28, 2002 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
ON March 27, the day Luke Moran and his family flew to Italy for a vacation, the United States State Department issued an announcement about a possible threat of terrorist activity in four Italian cities on Easter Sunday, four days later.
     Mr. Moran said he learned about the announcement when he and his family checked into their hotel in Rome and were given a copy of the State Department memo. Rome was not one of the cities mentioned in the announcement, but Florence was, and the Morans had planned to visit Florence on Easter weekend -- ironically, a decision calculated to avoid the large crowds anticipated at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, at least partly for safety reasons. 
 ""We were laughing about what a great choice we made,"" said Mr. Moran, a financial adviser in Troy, Mich. Although he said he was glad to have the information, the only change the family ultimately made to their itinerary was where they attended Easter Mass in Florence. ""We were going to go to the Duomo, but we ended up going to a small parish church,"" he said. ""So we did change our plans, but that was the only event we changed."" 
Advice, Not Orders
That is more or less the response the United States government hopes for when issuing these types of announcements: not dissuading people from pursuing their travel plans but encouraging an extra dose of caution. However, foreign governments, travel companies and some Americans traveling or living abroad have mixed feelings about the State Department's various travel announcements and warnings, which are often criticized as vague or overly broad. While some critics say the announcements may do more harm than good, others would simply like to see the system improved to better meet the current needs of American travelers.
Part of the problem is that there is some confusion about the different types of alerts issued by the government. Although they are often referred to by the news media as ""warnings,"" the State Department distinguishes between what it calls ""public announcements"" and ""travel warnings."" The difference is one of both duration and degree.
""Public announcements are usually pegged to a particular event or a particular situation and they usually have a duration or a time limit,"" said C. Edward Dickens, a spokesman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington. ""It might be something like, 'There's an earthquake in this country,' or what we did recently in Italy.""
The Italy announcement referred to four cities that might be the targets of extremist groups -- Venice, Florence, Milan and Verona -- and mentioned a specific date of concern, March 31 (although the announcement was not scheduled to expire until April 25).
A travel warning, on the other hand, ""does not have a specific duration and relates to a situation that is less specific than it would be for a public announcement, like the situation in Israel, where there is an ongoing conflict,"" Mr. Dickens said. When a warning is issued, the State Department recommends that Americans avoid travel to a particular country. Explaining the policy, Mr. Dickens said: ""We are not telling people what they have to do in response to these . It's up to people to decide for themselves what they want to do.""
But some Americans say that the government is not giving them enough information to make informed decisions, and may need to update its public information apparatus for a world in which the threat of terrorism has expanded beyond countries like Peru and Algeria to popular tourist destinations like Italy -- and New York.
Rosemary Porreca's daughter, Danielle, 21, was attending an overseas study program in Florence when the State Department announcement was released. Ms. Porreca first heard about it on CNN and immediately called the program's liaison in California, who had not yet heard the news. Ms. Porecca later called the State Department, hoping to learn more.
""I said, 'What is your recommendation to me -- I have a daughter who's in Florence.' I wanted to know, is it safe?"" Ms. Porreca said. The State Department representative she spoke with ""was absolutely no help whatsoever,"" she recalled. ""All she could tell me was, 'I have no further information.' "" 
One of Ms. Porreca's concerns was that the announcement was in effect for a month. She said that a State Department representative told her that these types of announcements typically covered a period of one month but could not clarify if that meant a continuing threat existed.
Ultimately Danielle, a junior at Boston College, decided to leave the program (which is not affiliated with the college) early and return home to Purchase, N.Y. She said she had been feeling uneasy about the safety of the neighborhood she was living in before the March 27 announcement. With that added concern, she said, ""The thought that the government had information about extremist groups in Florence that were planning to do something bad to me made me r"

""We will not agree to hold dialogue with the Maoists at this moment unless they surrender all the looted arms,"" Khadka told reporters.
The Maoists last week launched the deadliest offensive of their six-year insurgency, leaving at least 164 people dead in assaults on police posts, including one around Khadka's house, in the southwestern Dang district.
""Although we could not stop them in these attacks, the army fought very bravely with limited resources,"" Khadka said.
""We are fully confident that our security personnel will be successful to suppress the Maoist terrorists,"" he said, while acknowledging ""it may take more time"".
Nepal's government reached a ceasefire with the Maoists last year and held three rounds of peace talks, which deadlocked over rebel demands to scrap the monarchy.
The Maoists broke the four-month truce in November with a string of attacks on security forces, prompting the government to deploy the army against them for the first time.
Some 1,300 people have since been killed, on top of 1,800 who had already died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" in 1996.

The American company, an international consultancy firm, would be responsible of the management of the bank for two years and the duration can be extended for another year, if the outcome is impressive, according to the agreement signed here Thursday.
The DTT will be responsible for taking complete control of day to day running of the bank, providing immediate help to stabilize the bank's operation and restoring its financial health to an acceptable level, the daily said, quoting the agreement.
The DTT will work under the board of directors of the bank and prepare a plan within two months to revamp the bank management, the daily said, adding that in an attempt to correct the situation of the bank, the DTT will design a comprehensive reform program and then implement the scheme in the second phase, according to the provision of the agreement.
The Nepali government decided to hand over the Bank's management to the DTT due to the fact that the bank lost more than 33 million US dollars in last fiscal year because of its poor management.
The Nepali government will pay about 5.8 million US dollar to the American company for the management of the bank for a period of two years.

""At least 48 government security personnel were killed when the a group of guerrilla insurgents suddenly attacked two police posts located in Dang district in the midwest of Nepal on Thursday night, "" the police officer said, adding that ""six civilians were also killed during the guerrillas attack.""
Meanwhile, the anti-government guerrillas also took away a large amount of weapons and explosive materials from the police posts, he added. .
More than 800 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year. The government did this following a series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency. The insurgency has claimed more than 3,000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

Army chief General Prajwalla Shumsher Rana on Wednesday had denounced politicians for failing to counter the rebels and accused some in power of using the chaos in the kingdom to ""grab power.""
The opposition demanded that Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba clarify Rana's remarks.
""It is questionable whether Rana's statement works towards the unity or disunity of the nation,"" said Madhav Kumar Nepal, leader of the main opposition Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML).
""Is is right at a time when the whole nation is protesting against the Maoist activities, that a man should try to boost the morale of his army fighting the terrorists or should he speak against the people's representatives?"" Nepal said.
The president of the rightist National Democratic Party, Surya Bahadur Thapa, criticised the remarks as ""very serious and highly objectionable.""
""The prime minister, who also holds the defence portfolio, should come with an explanation for what the army chief said,"" Thapa said.
""While a government official has his rights to speak out his mind about any topic, he should keep himself within the limits and on the right forum,"" he said.
In unusually strong remarks for the head of the army, which is under civilian control, Rana on Wednesday lashed out at unspecificed politicians, ministers and MPs who have criticized the army for not dealing a death blow to the rebels.
""The deteriorating situation of the country over the last few years has now reached a critical point,"" Rana told a graduation ceremony at the Royal Nepal Army's (RNA) Command and Staff College on Kathmandu's outskirts.
""It is imperative to ask here, who led the country to this situation? Was this situation brought by the RNA or mis-government?"" he asked.
""How justifiable it is to blame the army for this unnatural situation brought by various political reasons in the last 12 years?""
""At a time when our country needs to unite to defeat the terrorists, (some politicians) are taking advantage of the confusing situation to grab power,"" Rana charged.
Some observers have charged that the army has been confined mostly to their barracks in district headquarters rather than heading to the jungles to flush out the Maoists.
Rana denounced the allegations as ""baseless.""
Other opposition leaders also demanded Deuba explain whether he gave his consent for Rana to lash out at those who criticized the army.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a republic. More than 2,700 people have been killed in the insurgency so far and 27 were injured on Friday in two bomb blasts by suspected rebels.
But the army was not deployed to fight the rebels until November 2001, when the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with Deuba's government and launched a string of attacks across the country.

Bush to seek military aid.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Washington's help in crushing the rebels and reviving development projects shut down by the six-year Maoist campaign to overthrow the kingdom's constitutional monarchy.
""Our plan is to assist the country with its security needs, and its development needs,"" U.S. Embassy spokesman Robert Kerr told The Associated Press. ""We are anxious to provide assistance to this struggling new democracy, so that it can survive.""
Air strikes ended Tuesday morning, army officials said, and soldiers of the Royal Nepalese Army scoured the mountainous area of Lisne, in the far west, where an operation was launched to wipe out some 1,500 rebels at their largest training camp.
A senior government official said the offensive - which was to resume on Wednesday - would last at least two more days.
There were conflicting reports of the casualty figures.
With 14 rebels killed Monday, 396 rebels had been shot dead since the army's offensive began Thursday in the Rolpa region, the Maoist stronghold where the main fighting is taking place, said Tana Gautam, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
Achyut Wagle, the prime minister's adviser, said 200 more guerrillas had been killed Sunday, bringing the total dead to more than 560 since Thursday.
Several Nepali language newspapers reported Maoist fatalities of up to 700, quoting villagers and rebel sympathizers in the Rolpa region.
The figures could not be verified as neither journalists nor human rights activists have access to the remote battle zones.
Security forces say only three soldiers and one police officer have been killed in the current offensive.
Panchnarayan Maharjan, an expert on Maoists at the Center for Nepal and Asian Studies at Tribhuvan University in Katmandu, said the government estimates could be inflated.
""The figures will not help because people have no faith in the government's handling of the Maoist problem,"" he said. ""The information is not authentic because it's difficult to find out the casualties.""
The Maoist insurgency began in the remote western region in 1996, feeding on crippling poverty and poor governance. The rebels draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
The Bush administration recently asked Congress for dlrs 20 million in aid for Nepal for non-combat supplies such as army uniforms, provisions and medical supplies.
However, a source privy to discussions between Katmandu and Washington told the AP on condition of anonymity that automatic weapons and small military hardware were also on the table.
Nepal's cash-strapped government and its ill-equipped military have been struggling to fight the rebels, who have carried out several major attacks since they abandoned a four-month cease-fire last fall, saying peace negotiations were going nowhere.
On Sunday, Wagle told the AP that Nepal wanted ""all sorts of help,"" except the presence of American soldiers.
""We are seeking arms and ammunition, helicopter gunships and other military supplies,"" he said.
A U.S. security team from Washington traveled to the Maoist strongholds last month, and is assessing the U.S. package.
The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said it was concerned civilians were being harmed in the conflict, which has killed more than 3,800 people since 1996.
""It seems like a massacre has taken place. Whether of Maoists or civilians, it's impossible to say,"" Amnesty International's Nepal researcher, Ingrid Massage, said in London on Monday. She called for an independent inquiry into the fresh attacks.

An army spokesman said a group of about 500 guerrillas attacked a security post overnight in Khara village in Rukum, 320 kilometres (198 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.
""The army fought very bravely with the rebels which forced the terrorists to run away leaving behind some automatic guns, self-loading rifles (SLR's) and explosives on the scene, a defence ministry press release said.
""More than 152 bodies of Maoists have been recovered so far,"" state-run radio reported Tuesday evening.
Cabinet sources said 10 civilians were also killed while 20 soldiers were injured in the clash before being flown to Kathmandu for treatment.
The violence came as King Gyanendra Monday night extended by three months a state of emergency imposed to tackle the Maoist insurgency after it expired at midnight on Saturday.
The emergency was first introduced in November after the guerrillas broke a four month ceasefire and pulled out of peace talks.
It gives local authorities and security forces wide powers to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists and impose curfews, measures critics say are draconian and which have not stopped the rebels.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the insurgency has so far claimed more than 4,000 lives, with half the deaths coming in recent months.
The extension of the emergency has split the ruling Nepali Congress party, with caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Sunday being expelled for his decision to dissolve parliament and call elections two years early.
He apparently asked the king last week to dissolve the 205-member lower house of parliament and call elections for November 13 after his own party refused to back him over extending the emergency.

""Presently we have sent a warning to potential donors that (an appeal for donations) could happen … We sent out a warning to donors to be prepared,"" said Niels Juel of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Beijing.
He said a formal appeal will be launched for tents, quilts, water purification tablets and food if more people are evacuated from areas around the massive Dongting Lake in the central province of Hunan.
Water levels continued to rise in the lake Thursday, sparking fears dykes could break.
""Potentially it could become very serious,"" Juel said.
""One Red Cross person in Hunan compared this to a situation where you have a balloon filled with water, and once the balloon bursts, you'll have water everywhere.""
Around 10 million people are feared at risk from the lake, which acts as a catchment for the Yangtze River.
""Not much rain has been forecast, but still a lot of water is moving towards the lake … The level is still rising,"" Juel said.
""If the dykes break, it really will be very, very serious.""
The alert is for Red Cross societies around the world to look into their own pockets and perhaps contact their national governments to prepare to make donations if the situation deteriorates, Juel said.
Almost a million workers were battling Thursday to save what is one of China's most densely-populated regions from potentially catastrophic floods.
Army units were working around the clock alongside police officers and civilians to shore up dykes and embankments on Dongting Lake, officials and state press said.
Some residents, however, were not keen to evacuate, Juel said.
""It's like you see in Nepal and Europe. People tend to be reluctant to leave their homes and all their belongings,"" he said.

In a statement faxed to news organizations, Pushpa Kamal Dahal - more commonly known as Prachanda - said he had called for a three-day general strike coinciding with the elections on Nov. 12.
Prachanda has requested a truce several times since the rebels broke off peace talks with Nepal's government and resumed fighting last November. The government has rejected talk of a cease-fire as a ploy by the insurgents to gain time to regroup.
The elusive guerrilla leader repeated the offer Saturday and rebels would begin a ""massive"" publicity campaign urging meetings with politicians and eminent civilians to discuss ways to resolve the six-year insurgency, which has left nearly 5,000 people dead.
The guerrillas have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and impose communist rule based on the tenets of Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
There has been an upsurge in violence since the government lifted a state of emergency last month to allow free campaigning ahead of the parliamentary elections.
A strike called by the rebels shut down most of this Himalayan kingdom last week despite a heavy deployment of soldiers and police.
Emergency rule was declared last year following an escalation of the fighting. The rule gave security forces sweeping powers to detain people without trial and curbed civil liberties.

The official said the ministers also decided to recommend to their leaders in Kathmandu that they agree the next summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) would be held in Pakistan in early 2003, preceded by a meeting of foreign ministers in the Nepalese capital in June or July of this year.
SAARC -- comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldlives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- was formed in 1985 to promote regional cooperation and economic development.
Although the SAARC charter provides for an annual summit, the summit commencing Friday is being held for the first time in four years because of India's previous refusal to attend. India's forces clashed with Pakistan troops in the Kargil area of the disputed territory of Kashmir in 1999.
The summit has already been overshadowed by a fresh confrontation between the two countries' forces along the so-called Line of Control in Kashmir and their international border in the wake of the Dec. 13 terrorist attack on the Indian parliament.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the SAARC leaders will review implementation of the decisions made at the last summit in Sri Lanka in 1998, assess progress made on social, economic, trade and technical issues, and adopt a declaration to be issued at the end of their summit Sunday.
He said they will also approve a report on measures to combat terrorism and sign two conventions -- one on promoting child welfare and the other on cooperation in combating crimes against trafficking of women and children for prostitution.

Major political groups have scheduled public meetings on Tuesday to celebrate the restoration of democracy in Nepal in 1990 after their movement toppled the absolute monarchy.
The king continues as the ceremonial head of state, while the government is run by a prime minister accountable to Parliament.
On Sunday, Maoist rebels killed 77 policemen, 55 soldiers, an intelligence officer and four civilians in Achham district, 600 kilometers (375 miles) to the northwest of Katmandu.
The attacks on government offices and an airport were the deadliest since the rebels began fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996 from remote mountain areas.
Following the attacks, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba urged Parliament to extend the three-month national emergency imposed on Nov. 26 after the rebels abruptly ended peace talks and resumed fighting government forces.
In November, King Gyanendra accepted the government recommendation to press the army for the first time to fight the rebels, a task that had been carried out by police.
""The nation is currently under a state of emergency and security forces are conscientiously active in maintaining law and order. During this vulnerable state, shortcomings in political and administrative sectors could lead to further deterioration in the situation,"" the king said.
More than 2,400 people have died since the rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, began fighting.
The rebels have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday across Nepal to commemorate the sixth anniversary of their insurgency campaign.
The army says it has killed nearly 500 guerrillas and arrested another 1,400 since emergency was declared in November. Officials say more than 300 soldiers and officers also have died.
Earlier this month, suspected rebels set off two bombs in government tax offices in Katmandu, wounding at least 10 people.

The Alberta, Canada-based Light Up The World Foundation will split a $250,000 cash prize with the other four winners of the second annual Tech Museum Awards ceremony held Thursday night.
The awards, which are presented by the San Jose-based Tech Museum of Innovation and chip-equipment maker Applied Materials Inc., were established to encourage individuals, organizations and companies to implement technology to address global challenges.
""The heartwarming and inspiring stories of these remarkable people and organizations remind us of the potential goodness of technology,"" said Tech Museum chief executive Peter Giles.
The Light Up The World Foundation uses White Light Emitting Diodes to generate comfortable reading light that consumes only one-tenth of a watt of electricity and provides light for 10 years.
So far, the group has lit up more than 500 homes in Nepal, 100 homes in India and 50 homes in Sri Lanka for $17,350.
Organizers estimate a third of the world's population relies on dirty, fuel-based lighting after nightfall. Wood fires and kerosene lamps not only provide poor lighting but also generate toxic fumes.
Diodes can be powered by solar panels, wind turbines and pedal generators. Thirty minutes of pedaling produces enough power for up to 20 hours of diode light.
Other winners include:
- The International SeaKeepers Society for equipping cruise ships, luxury yachts and other vessels with sensors to study the oceans and atmosphere. Data collected are transferred to scientists around the world by the Key Biscayne, Fla.-based group.
- Bunker Roy of The Barefoot College in Rajasthan, India for teaching practical technology skills, from solar power to rainwater harvesting systems, to India's rural poor.
- ApproTEC, based in San Francisco and Kenya, for developing an efficient, low-cost irrigation pump that allows rural farmers in Africa to increase production capacity.
- Andreas Pluckthun of the University of Zurich in Switzerland for pioneering technology to create synthetic, or recombinant, antibodies that might someday be used to proactively treat diseases.
Judges considered 460 nominations from 59 countries for this year's awards - a 50 percent increase from last year.

"478",200253,"Title: THE INDIA - PAKISTAN TENSION_ NEWS ANALYSIS Seeking a New Ending.rtf; Date: January 2, 2002 Wednesday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
Confrontations between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, the beautiful Himalayan land, have unfolded like movie sequels with the same discouraging plot line. But recently, the sheer force of events seems to have fast-forwarded the story line between these old enemies and suddenly a different, more hopeful ending seems possible, if still unlikely. 
     Pakistan's military ruler, President Pervez Musharraf, has taken steps to crack down on two ""holy warrior"" groups that defense analysts say Pakistan has sponsored to fight Indian rule of Kashmir -- and that India has accused of carrying out an attack on Parliament on Dec. 13. The groups' leaders and dozens of their members have been arrested in the last week. 
 In just the past day or two, Indian officials have begun to consider for the first time the possibility that General Musharraf may be prepared to alter Pakistan's longstanding strategy of fomenting anti-India violence in Kashmir.
Though the Indians deeply mistrust him as the architect of a Pakistan Army incursion into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1999, they say perhaps General Musharraf is bending under severe pressure from the United States and an extreme military threat from India.
India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, acknowledged as much in his New Year's message today. If Pakistan is sincere about rooting out terrorism, he said, then India is ""willing to walk more than half the distance to work closely with Pakistan to resolve, through dialogue, any issue, including the contentious issue of Jammu and Kashmir.""
But the suspicion of Pakistan's motives runs deep here -- and it is possible that the arrests of Islamic militants in Pakistan only signals a tactical retreat to buy time or disguise some new strategy.
Will these men, now held on general charges, be released once the world's attention moves on from South Asia? Indian officials ask. Will Pakistan try to shift its support to anti-India rebels who are Kashmiris and therefore more easily defended as indigenous freedom fighters?
""It is still too early to form a final opinion,"" Arun Jaitley, a senior minister in the Indian government, said in an interview today. ""A signal here or there may be only a transient indicator. I still have my fingers crossed.""
The general and his men are saying the right things. General Musharraf declared on Christmas Day that ""wicked, bigoted extremists"" would not be allowed to destroy Pakistan from within.
Pakistan's foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, has called these Pakistan-based groups ""unconstitutional armies,"" suggesting that Pakistan is searching for a rationale to act against them that is not about India, but about Pakistan's own internal security.
A high-ranking military intelligence official in Pakistan said today that General Musharraf had decided to ""completely cut off all support to nonindigenous groups in Kashmir,"" and had ordered the closing of the military intelligence division that has long dealt with the militant groups.
The Kashmiris' struggle for independence began as an indigenous one in the late 1980's, but was largely taken over in the 1990's by the Pakistanis, who sought to use it as a vehicle for their own proxy war with India for control of Kashmir.
India is now trying to test General Musharraf's intentions. On Monday it handed over a list of 20 people, most of them Indians, who are suspected of committing sensational acts of terrorism over the last 10 to 15 years. India says these accused men are fugitives who have been given sanctuary in Pakistan and must be handed over for trial here.
But today, Pakistan said it would not hand over any of the 20, saying India lacked evidence against them.
In the meantime, India is keeping up its dangerous game of military brinkmanship with Pakistan.
India is not pulling back any of the hundreds of thousands of troops it has moved to the border since the Dec. 13 attack, which India laid at the doorstep of Pakistan and two militant Islamic groups operating there.
""It is too short a time to think of de-escalating now,"" said a defense official. ""We'll have to see if things are stabilizing. We'll be watching the steps Pakistan takes on the list of 20 people we have provided."" 
If India becomes convinced that General Musharraf's actions are a ruse, the two countries could still topple into their first full-scale war as declared nuclear powers.
Now, India insists the mobilization of its million-man army -- the largest buildup mounted since India and Pakistan's last war 30 years ago -- is purely defensive, while Pakistani officials have said they fear that an attack is imminent.
Indian officials clearly hope diplomacy, backed by the threat of war, will achieve their aim of ending violence in Kashmir and other parts of India.
But what if Pakistan does not go far enough in satisfying the ultimatums India has issued?

"480",20022739,"Title: India and Pakistan on path to dialogue_ Powell.rtf; Date: January 18, 2002 Friday; Text: US Secretary of State Colin Powell wound up a peace mission to Pakistan and India on an optimistic note Friday, saying the nuclear rivals seemed ready to find a way out of the crisis that has brought them to the brink of war.
""I leave here very encouraged that we can find a solution to this troubling situation,"" Powell said in a joint press conference in New Delhi with Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
""We exchanged a number of ideas of how we can move forward,"" he said, while adding that ""further action"" was needed before mutual confidence could be restored.
India and Pakistan have massed 800,000 troops along their common border since last month's attack on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi has blamed on militants allegedly sponsored by Islamabad.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announced in a speech Saturday a crackdown on Islamic extremism and banned five radical groups. Since then almost 2,000 alleged militants have been arrested.
But India insists further visible steps must be taken before a dialogue can begin and is also seeking the extradition of 20 wanted criminals allegedly sheltered by Pakistan.
""I think we are on a path that could lead to the restoration of dialogue… but it will take further action before we can really start walking down that path actively,"" said Powell, who arrived here Thursday from Islamabad.
Singh said that while New Delhi welcomed Musharraf's speech, it still wanted to see steps taken ""demonstrably and recognisably"" on the ground.
Powell proposed a three-stage process for resolving the crisis: a toning down of rhetoric, examination of tit-for-tat diplomatic sanctions imposed in recent weeks and finally a military de-escalation on the border.
""These were just suggestions of ways we can move forward without trying to get any agreement at this time, because agreements will come in due course as confidence is restored,"" Powell said.
""I think we are off to a pretty good start… let's see where this start takes us.""
But even as Powell was meeting with Indian leaders, Musharraf was telling a meeting of Islamic scholars in Islamabad that India could not sit in judgement on his efforts to rein in religious extremists.
""We have to show no action to anybody,"" Musharraf said.
""We want peace. We do not want war, but if war is thrust upon us we are ready to defend our country with full force and might.""
Referring to the list of 20 suspects, Singh said if action was taken by Islamabad then he was ""very hopeful"" that Indo-Pakistan relations could be restored to their state before the parliament attack.
Powell discussed the military face-off with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra in talks here Friday.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
Powell's mission capped weeks of telephone diplomacy by Washington which has watched the escalation of Indo-Pakistan tensions with increasing alarm.
The crisis has caused Pakistan to shift troops and military resources away from its western border with Afghanistan where they have been used to block the entry of fleeing al-Qaeda fighters.
Briefing reporters on Powell's plane after he left India for Nepal, a senior US official gave an upbeat assessment of the secretary of state's mission to secure assurances from India and Pakistan that they would resolve the current crisis through diplomacy and not armed conflict.
""We got that commitment,"" the official said.
Meanwhile, in an interview with the Star television channel before leaving Delhi, Powell said -- in a clear reference to Kashmir -- that once an Indo-Pakistan dialogue resumed it should cover all outstanding bilateral disputes, ""and not just any one single issue.""

"481",20022694,"Title: Nepal Police Release Journalists.rtf; Date: August 5, 2002 Monday; Text: Two newspaper editors were detained for a day for publishing accusations of police corruption and alleged extortion in what a media rights group on Monday called part of a campaign of intimidation against the press.
The two were released Monday after Taranath Dahal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, met with top police officers.
Dahal said the arrests were aimed at intimidating journalists in Nepal, where nearly 100 have been detained without charges or arrested under an emergency decree that restricts freedom of the press.
Kishor Shrestha, editor of Janaastha weekly, and Bishnu Ghimire, editor of the Janaprahar daily, were picked up from their offices on Sunday, said Ram Chandra Khanal, a police officer.
Police accused Shrestha of libeling a criminal investigator with published accusations of bribery, while Ghimire was accused of demanding $128 from a restaurant owner whom the editor accused of supplying prostitutes.
Police have been given sweeping powers to arrest or detain anyone without warrants for 24 days since the government declared a state of emergency in November to fight a Maoist insurgency. Civil rights, including press freedoms, have also been suspended.
Neither of the editors could be reached for comment. They were not formally charged during their detention.
Their arrests drew fire from media groups in Nepal, where more than 20 journalists are still in custody.
""We have strongly condemned the arrests. The government is only trying to scare journalists,"" said Bishnu Nisthuri, also of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists. ""These journalists were arrested without any basis and because they have been writing against police and the government's curtailing of the press freedom in the country.""
Shrestha has blamed police for the death of Krishna Sen, an editor of the weekly Janadisha newspaper, after he was arrested for allegedly writing articles in support of the rebels, who are fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
The government has not confirmed Sen's death but said that police were investigating.
Last month, the Paris-based media rights group Reporters Without Borders said Sen had ""died under torture"" in a government detention center.
The government shut down the newspaper in November and arrested most of the journalists working there.

At least five anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot in Kalikot district on Thursday night while seven others were killed in some others districts, all located in the west part of the country, when they exchanged fires with the government security forces, the press release said.
The security forces also seized a large amount of weapons, ammunitions and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations across the country.
Twenty-six people including four army men and some children were injured when a bomb exploded in Kathmandu valley on Friday morning.
""The Bomb exploded on a bridge over the Bishnumati river in Kathmandu valley,"" the police officer said, adding that ""Some of the wounded children were in serious conditions.""
He also noted that the bomb explosion accident was created by the anti-government guerrillas.
More than 700 guerrillas and over 200 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed more than 3, 000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

"484",20021055,"Title: Leahy, Jody Williams laud progress on land mines.rtf; Date: September 13, 2002, Friday, BC cycle; Text: India and Pakistan have embarked on a massive land mine-laying operation along their border in Kashmir in possibly the largest deployment of mines in decades, a watchdog group said Friday.
Numerous civilians and soldiers on both sides have been injured by the mines, said the International Campaign to Ban Landmines in its 928-page Landmine Monitor 2002 report.
But the report also contains some good news: governments destroyed more than seven million stockpiled mines last year, bringing to 34 million the number destroyed since a land mine treaty was ratified in 1997. The number of countries exporting land mines has dropped to 14 from the original number of 55.
The number of land mine accidents also has fallen, to around 15,000-20,000 per year, the report said. ""The long-standing and commonly cited figure of 26,000 new land mine victims each year is no longer valid.""
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has been a leader in pushing for reductions in land mines, said he was encouraged by those findings, but that much more needs to be done.
""We have turned the corner on land mines, and Vermont has helped lead the way,"" said Leahy, who won passage in 1992 of legislation banning the exports of land mines from the United States and has pushed successfully for aid to mine victims.
Leahy credited former Putney resident Jody Williams, who shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Price with the ICBL, with leading an effort that culminated in what his office called the first major international weapons treated initiated by citizens rather than governments.
Leahy added: ""I have picked up with the Bush administration where we left off with the Clinton administration in pushing for more progress in ridding our arsenal of these indiscrimiate weapons. We also need to do more in helping with de-mining efforts in Afghanistan and other countries.""
Indian army officials said in July that mines had been laid across 173,000 acres of the frontier that divides Kashmir between the South Asian rivals as part of a troop buildup in December. Pakistani soldiers also have laid mines.
ICBL said it had evidence that at least six nongovernment groups of fighters also had set mines or improvised explosive devices in the area.
""The mine-laying in India and Pakistan is startling because of the length of the border and the length of the minefields - in some places up to 1 kilometer (2/3 mile) - the density of the minefields and their proximity to villages and farming land,"" Mary Wareham, the report's global coordinator, told reporters.
Although the total number of mines deployed in Kashmir is unknown, more mines were probably laid in the year that started May 2001 than in any previous year covered by the report, which was first published in 1999, said ICBL, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.
The report also said deployment of mines along the Kashmir border was possibly the largest in a single conflict in decades.
The report will be presented next week in Geneva at a meeting of countries that have ratified the 1997 treaty to ban the production, sale and use of land mines.
Wareham said ICBL had urged countries that have signed the treaty to complain to the Indian and Pakistani governments about the mine-laying, but it can do little directly against the two countries as neither has signed the treaty.
ICBL said there was also ""extensive ongoing use"" of anti-personnel mines by the government of Myanmar and by Russian forces in Chechnya, as well as to a lesser extent by Nepal and Somalia. Although Georgia has had a moratorium on use of mines since 1996, the country's forces also apparently laid mines.
The report said nine governments were reported to have used land mines during the period covered, and two of those - Angola and Sri Lanka - have since declared cease-fires and stopped use. In the previous year there were 13 governments laying mines.
A total of 125 countries have ratified the land mine treaty, and another 18 have signed it but have not yet ratified. ICBL said more than a dozen governments - including Afghanistan, Greece, Indonesia, Turkey and Yugoslavia - have announced their intention to join soon.
However, the United States, Russia and China are among 50 countries that so far have refused to sign the treaty. China is believed to have a stockpile of 110 million mines, while Russia has 60-70 million and the United States 11.2 million.

Four more people drowned in eastern India on Wednesday and an overflowing river threatened to inundate low-lying areas around the populous capital city of Bihar state, relief officials said Thursday.
At least 904 people have died in monsoon floods across India, Bangladesh and Nepal.
The state's water department said heavy rains were pushing up the water level of Punpun River, which originates in Nepal and flows into Bihar, and could trigger fresh floods around the city of Patna by Friday. Patna is home to some 1.7 million people.
The water level in the Punpun River was 42 inches above the danger mark and might swell by another 34 inches over the next 24 hours, the department said in its latest update. Weather forecasts for the region called for continued rain through Thursday.
In Khagariya district, about 100 miles northwest of Patna, a postman was swept away, a 7-year boy drowned and two men died as their boat sank in the Gandak River, said the state's top relief official, Sambhu Saran Singh. Flood waters also swept into the town of Khagariya, forcing authorities to shift dozens of prisoners from a local jail.
Rising rivers also submerged railroad tracks near Samastipur, 100 miles northeast of Patna, halting rail traffic for a large swathe of Bihar. Army soldiers in motorized boats were helping to evacuate thousands of villagers whose mud and thatch huts were washed away by raging flood waters.
The floods have destroyed about 2.5 million acres of maize in the state and affected more than 15 million people, Singh said.
The deaths in Khagariya on Wednesday pushed up the death toll in Bihar to 269, he said. Another 39 people have died in the northeastern state of Assam, and earlier this month six people died when rains loosened a boulder that crashed onto shanties in Bombay.
In Arunachal Pradesh state, bordering China, seven soldiers were swept away while carrying out rescue operations a week ago, officials said.
New flooding in India's northeast swept two people away Tuesday in a remote village in Manipur state, bordering Myanmar.
About 7 million people have been hit by floods in the northeast and several key road and communication links have largely been cut off.
In all, monsoon floods have killed 323 people in India according to official estimates, though in most parts of the country rains have been delayed, damaging crops and causing the worst drought in 14 years.
Another 157 people have died in neighboring Bangladesh since the onset of monsoon rains in June. Water levels of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers, which had receded last week, began rising again Wednesday following fresh downpours in the country's northern region, Bangladesh's food forecasting center said. Monsoon floods have displaced more than 6 million others in the delta nation.
The highest death toll has been from Nepal, where at least 424 people have either been swept away by swirling floodwaters or crushed under mudslides in remote mountainous villages. About 250,000 people have been hit by torrential rains in the Himalayan kingdom, officials said.
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has asked international donors for $1.7 million in immediate aid for the victims in Nepal and $1.9 million for those in India as emergency relief supplies have been exhausted.

Both sides agreed that the Royal Nepalese Army needs more equipment to combat the rebels, and that India and Nepal should share intelligence and step up security along their 1,750-kilometer (1,090-mile) open border, India's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said.
India has already given Nepal two helicopter gunships and has promised to provide additional support in the fight against the rebels.
""We remain committed to do whatever we can do for Nepal,"" Rao said after Gyanendra's meetings Monday with President Kocheril R. Narayanan and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Talks also focused on trade ties and regional security.
Gyanendra arrived Sunday for a six-day visit to India, in his first trip abroad since taking the throne last year after his brother's death in a palace massacre committed by the crown prince.
Tuesday, the king is scheduled to address a gathering of Indian businessmen and meet with Defense Minister George Fernandes and opposition leader Sonia Gandhi.
Nepal has been pressing India to increase security along the border, as Maoist rebels often escape the police and army by crossing the border and finding shelter in Indian villages.
The elusive rebel chief ""Prachanda,"" meaning ""the fierce one"" in Nepali, is believed to be hiding in India, Nepalese authorities say.
""We have taken measures to tighten security along the border,"" Rao said, adding that the Maoists pose a challenge to regional peace.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy, and they are believed to have links with some rebel groups active in India.
The Press Trust of India news agency reported that India has also agreed to send counterinsurgency experts to Nepal to train its army.
Gyanendra began his official engagements Monday by reviewing an honor guard at the presidential palace.
A 21-gun salute boomed as Gyanendra marched slowly past troops from the Indian army, navy, air force and the president's cavalry in the forecourt of the red sandstone colonial palace.
Although Gyanendra is the figurehead, his talks with Indian leaders were expected to go beyond ceremonial formalities.
But when questioned by journalists, Gyanendra declined to reveal what kind of assistance Nepal was seeking from India.
""There's nothing specific that I should be taking up,"" he told journalists at the presidential palace.
Fighting between the rebels and government forces has intensified since Gyanendra declared emergency rule in November and ordered the army, for the first time, to help the police fight the guerrillas.
The rebels draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong and are active in western parts of Nepal, which suffer from high incidence of poverty and underdevelopment.
Indian help for several infrastructure projects in Nepal was also discussed Monday, the foreign ministry said.

""I can understand it would take a little time for Pakistan to address itself to its internal difficulties and to dismantle all these edifices of terrorism that they have either permitted or constructed over the last two decades,"" External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told a news conference in Nepal.
Pakistan welcomed Singh's statement.
""It's a positive development,"" said Ashfaq Gondal, the Pakistan government spokesman, comparing it with Singh's earlier characterization of Pakistan's crackdown on the militant groups as ""cosmetic.""
He had said Wednesday that ""the ice is melting"" between the two governments, after Singh and Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar shook hands, smiled, and met with other South Asian ministers.
Singh, however, refused to describe the atmosphere between Indian and Pakistani officials at the meeting, while both countries' armies are on alert along their border, diplomatic contacts have been cut, and passenger transportation halted between them.
""I'm not here to conduct India-Pakistan relations,"" Singh said, insisting that the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meeting attended by seven nations this week was aimed at economic development and does not address ""bilateral, contentious issues.""
The Pakistani spokesman, Gondal, said the regional grouping couldn't think of cooperation when there was tension between two member-states.
""We have to work for easing tensions to initiate the process of cooperation,"" Gondal said.
India accuses Pakistan of waging a ""proxy war"" in the disputed province of Kashmir, divided between them and claimed in its entirety by both. Warlike tensions arose after a Dec. 13 suicide attack on India's Parliament, which India blamed on Pakistan's spy agency and two Islamic militant groups - Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.
Since the United States declared the groups terrorist organizations, the government of Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has banned the groups, frozen their assets, and arrested a total of 50 of their members, including the leaders.
Singh had previously called Pakistan's actions ""cosmetic,"" saying the accounts were frozen only after being emptied and that the detentions of the leaders were not real.
On Thursday, however, he was more positive.
""The steps taken against Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are welcome steps in the right direction, but they need to be pursued and they need to act much more in that direction,"" he said.
Pakistan has consistently denied that it supports terrorist groups. In the past it has called Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed ""freedom fighters"" because of their participation in the 12-year insurgency aimed at separating Muslim majority Kashmir from India.
""It would be our expectation that a much more purposeful and forthright declaration against terrorism would be forthcoming,"" Singh said, adding that India expects action on a list of 20 ""proven terrorists, criminals and narcotics smugglers"" given to Pakistan last week.
At the news conference he outlined India's demands to Pakistan, dating back to 1993, for extradition of men wanted in bomb explosions, an airline hijacking, and other criminal acts. He said photographs, airline manifests, testimonies and reports have been handed over.
Pakistan's government has said it would consider extraditing wanted criminals to India if it receives proof of their crimes.
Gondal noted that one of the names on the list, Jaish founder and leader Masood Azhar, had been in Indian jails for five years and was never charged or tried.
Azhar was freed in exchange for passengers aboard a hijacked Indian Airlines flight that was hijacked to Afghanistan on Dec. 24, 1999.

A large number of anti-government guerrillas is believed to be killed in the fighting, he noted without giving any details of the casualties of the security personnel and the anti-government guerrillas.

This is the second biggest attack by the anti-government guerrillas in the last two days. The anti-government guerrillas attacked the Bhiman police post in Sindhuli district Saturday night and killed at least 49 policemen.
The Sunday's assault is the biggest attack launched by the anti- government guerrillas since the nine-month-long nationwide state of emergency in Nepal expired at the end of August.

"489",20022226,"Title: South Asian leaders condemn terrorism, but differ on definition.rtf; Date: January 5, 2002 Saturday; Text: South Asian leaders opened a summit here Saturday all backing the international coalition against terrorism, but with some calling for a careful study on the root causes of ""de-humanising"" violence.
The seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) urged concerted action to combat terrorism, but nuclear powers India and Pakistan appeared to differ on the definition.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, in a thinly-veiled reference to Pakistan, said ""some countries"" had not taken action to implement a 1987 SAARC convention on suppressing terrorism.
""We in South Asia have to recognise that our cooperative future will be significantly influenced by the way in which we can tackle terrorism together,"" Vajpayee said.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said his country was also a victim of terrorism and vowed to fully implement the 1987 SAARC convention on suppressing it.
""A concerted campaign against terrorism must also identify and examine the causes that breed terrorism, that drive people to hopelessness and desperation,"" Musharraf said, in a clear reference to India's oppressive security apparatus in Kashmir.
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the outgoing head of SAARC whose country has faced a Tamil separatist insurgency for three decades, called for a more ""honest"" approach to deal with terrorism.
""We have to join our hands, at least now, more honestly and with more dedication, to fight the wave of terroristic politics that is sweeping across our region,"" Kumaratunga said.
She said it was insufficient to say that terrorists will be hunted down without an understanding of the causes.
""We must attempt to understand the deep-rooted cause of this most unnatural, de-humanising phenomenon very specific to the 20th century -- that is terrorism,"" Kumaratunga said.
Musharraf could not have agreed more.
""We cannot address only the symptom and leave the malaise aside,"" Musharraf said. ""It is equally important that a distinction be maintained between acts of legitimate resistance and freedom struggles on the one hand and acts of terrorism on the other.""
New Delhi accuses Islamabad of sponsoring cross-border terrorism, particularly in the disputed region of Kashmir.
Pakistan maintains that the Muslim separatist insurgency in Kashmir is a just struggle for self-determination, which government spokesman Rashid Qureshi said Friday could not be called ""terrorism by any stretch of imagination.""
Bhutan's Prime Minister Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk condemned the December 13 attack against the Indian parliament and called for ""collective efforts of the international community"" to bring the perpetrators to justice.
India has said that Pakistan sponsored the attack, a charge denied by Islamabad.
""The reality of terrorism as an organised evil that will continue to haunt us and ravage our societies must be recognised,"" Wangchuk said.
Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said his country, which is battling an uprising by Maoist rebels, was forced to divert money to contain the militants.
""To root out the growing menace of terrorism, we should collectively and resolutely fight against this crime and should block drug trafficking and organised crimes that finance and support it,"" Deuba said.
The 1987 SAARC convention allows for the extradition of suspects between member states and sharing of intelligence and freezing of assets of designated terrorist organisations.
The summit heard support for the United Nations resolution against terrorism that followed the September 11 attacks in the United States.
A high-level meeting of SAARC member states is due in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, most probably by April, to agree on mechanisms to implement the UN anti-terrorism resolution and regulations in the region, diplomats said.
Cross-border terrorism has strained relations between members countries of SAARC which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

"490",20022146,"Title: Nepal government says security forces kill 350 Maoists in western Nepal.rtf; Date: May 4, 2002 Saturday; Text: Security forces killed at least 350 guerrillas in gunbattles in western Nepal, the Defense Ministry said Saturday, in what would be the deadliest battles in the rebels' 6-year-old campaign to oust the constitutional monarchy.
The attack by security forces on rebel camps and hide-outs in Lisne area of Rolpa district, a guerrilla stronghold some 350 kilometers (220 miles) west of Katmandu, began Thursday and lasted until Friday night, the ministry said in a statement.
""The rebels have suffered heavy losses. Army soldiers and police have destroyed most of their training camps in that region,"" Devendra Raj Kandel, junior interior minister, told The Associated Press.
Kandel said security forces have killed more than 500 guerrillas since last week when the government ruled out negotiations with the rebels and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said he would ""crush them"" with force.
The death toll could not be confirmed independently. The rebels, fighting for a Communist state, do not comment on such incidents.
The bloodshed comes ahead of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's visit to Washington next week. He is scheduled to meet U.S. President George W. Bush to discuss the insurgency.
The Bush administration recently asked Congress for dlrs 20 million in military aid for Nepal.
The rebel fighting since 1996 has killed more than 3,500 people, crippled Nepal's aid-dependent economy and deterred tourists from traveling to this Himalayan kingdom of exquisite beauty.
On Friday, the ministry said that army had killed 40 guerillas. The death toll increased to 350 by Friday night as security forces searched for more hide-outs and killed more guerrillas, including several local rebel commanders, the ministry said Saturday.
Several rebels were also arrested during the army offensive in Rolpa, which came after Maoists attacked a team of security forces patrolling the area, the ministry said. Two soldiers and one policeman were also killed in the fighting, it said.
Elsewhere, security forces killed another six rebels in three separate shootouts on Friday night, the ministry said.
The rebels are active in 29 of Nepal's 75 districts. Rolpa, this week's battle ground, is considered a Maoist stronghold.
Human rights groups have accused both the security forces and the insurgents of killing civilians and committing other atrocities since King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency in November.
The emergency came after the rebels, inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Tse-tung, called off peace talks and renewed attacks on government targets.
Until the latest battles, the highest previous death toll was on April 11-12, when more than 200 policemen and guerrillas were killed in western Dang district.
The government intensified its campaign against the rebels after they called a nationwide strike last week that did not get much public support.
On Friday, Deuba rejected a reported offer by rebel leader Prachand to hold peace talks. Nepali newspapers on Thursday said they had received a statement from the rebels' elusive leader Prachand, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, offering to resume talks.
""The army is determined to stamp out the rebels,"" Kandel, the junior interior minister, said.
""There will be no talks until the rebels lay down their arms,"" he said adding, the army had seized large amounts of weapons and ammunition in the Rolpa attack.

The military says it has now killed 189 rebels since Feb. 17, when the guerrillas killed 137 soldiers, police and civilians in attacks in Mangalsen town of Achham district.
They were the worst attacks since the rebels began fighting to topple Nepal's constitutional monarchy in 1996.
The latest casualties came on Tuesday in fighting in Kalikot district, about 400 miles west of the capital Katmandu, when soldiers killed eight rebels. Six more guerrillas died in fighting elsewhere, the ministry said.
On Monday, the army killed 13 rebels in neighboring Achham and Surkhet districts.
More than 2,600 people have been killed in the six-year insurgency. The rebels say they draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung.

"492",20022057,"Title: Conservation group says poaching pushing Asian rhino to extinction.rtf; Date: August 13, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Pressure from poachers feeding the demand for traditional medicine is driving the Asian rhinoceros ever closer to extinction, the conservation group WWF International said Wednesday.
Poachers have stepped up their illegal trade, killing at least 86 rhinos in the past four years, said WWF in a new report.
""Recently, 15 rhinos were killed in a five-month spate of poaching in Nepal, showing us that there is no room for complacency in our battle to save this species,"" said Elizabeth Kemf, co-author of the 24-page study.
Of the almost 18,000 wild rhinos worldwide, most live in Africa. But there are still 2,900 animals living wild in Asia, in countries from Nepal to Indonesia. The population ranges from just five rhinos in Vietnam to some 2,400 in Nepal and India combined.
Hunters slaughter the rhino mainly for its horn, an ingredient used in traditional Oriental medicine to treat illnesses ranging from fevers to nosebleeds.
The powdered horn is processed into tablets and tonics and is sold worldwide, mainly in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and other countries where Chinese communities live, including the United States.
The horn is not considered an aphrodisiac, WWF said.
Both China and Taiwan have banned sales of rhino horn in the past two decades, but the law is widely ignored, according to WWF. A study by the group four years ago in the United States found medicines containing rhino horn and parts of other protected species in half the 110 traditional medicine stores surveyed in seven cities.
The Asian rhino also is under threat from logging, commercial plantations of oil palms, coffee or rubber, and forest clearance by people hungry for agricultural land. WWF said the changes make it easier for poachers to reach rhino habitats. The shrinking forest also concentrates the animals in ever-decreasing areas, leaving them more vulnerable to inbreeding and natural disasters like floods.
There are three species of Asian rhino: the greater one-horned rhino, the Javan and the Sumatran.
Vietnam's Javan rhinos are on the brink of extinction, WWF said. There are around five animals left in the country, maybe as few as three, and all of them are believed to be female, Kemf told The Associated Press.
In Indonesia there are no more than 60 Javans.
WWF said it had funded protection units which have successfully ended poaching of the Javan rhino, but remained seriously concerned by the species' low numbers.
There are some 300 Sumatran rhinos in Indonesia and Malaysia, and WWF said they were ""under relentless pressure"" from the hunters.
WWF and authorities in Nepal have worked to tackle poaching and move 72 rhinos to a new national park location to ""minimize human/rhino conflicts"" and establish a second population in the country. But the conservation organization said the 2,400 one-horned rhinos in Nepal and neighboring India were just as vulnerable as the animals in the other Asian nations
""Unless more money and effort goes into reducing the demand for traditional Asian medicine, anti-poaching, and curbing land conversion for oil palm, coffee and paper pulp, we risk losing these prehistoric yet majestic looking creatures forever,"" said Christy Williams, WWF's Asian rhino program coordinator.

Pervez Musharraf, officials said.
The officials of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) said the inaugural session of the 11th SAARC summit, which had been scheduled for Friday afternoon, has been postponed until 10 a.m. Saturday.
A senior official of the Pakistani delegation told reporters that Musharraf was tentatively scheduled to arrive in Kathmandu in the evening and that a leaders' retreat at the Nagar Kot hill resort scheduled Saturday has been called off.
The summit was originally set to be held for three days from Friday. It was not immediately clear if it would end on Monday as previously scheduled.
Bangladeshi President Khalida Zia arrived in Kathmandu on Friday morning, making Musharraf the only head of state yet to arrive.
Summit sources said Musharraf was originally due in Kathmandu by Friday noon but his departure from Beijing was delayed due to fog.
He is flying to the Nepalese capital via China since India has banned Pakistani aircraft flights over its territory as part of measures taken since the Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament.
India has accused two Pakistan-based militant groups of staging the attack, and Indian and Pakistan forces have been massing along the so-called Line of Control in the divided territory of Kashmir and along their international border.
SAARC -- comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- was formed in 1985 to promote regional cooperation and economic development.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee will also be among seven heads of state and government attending a three-day summit meeting, but Indian officials have said he has no intention of meeting separately with Musharraf.
The spiraling tension between India and Pakistan is expected to overshadow other issues discussed among the leaders in Kathmandu.
The 11th summit was originally scheduled to be held in Kathmandu in November 1999, but was postponed at the request of India, which was unwilling then to share the platform with Musharraf, who had taken power in a military coup a few months earlier. The two countries forces clashed in the Kargil area of the disputed territory of Kashmir that same year.
At the summit, the leaders are expected to approve a report on measures to combat terrorism and sign two conventions -- one on promoting child welfare and the other on cooperation in combating crimes against trafficking of women and children for prostitution.
The upcoming summit is expected to yield a pledge to finalize the draft framework for the free trade zone by the end of this year.

""At least 17 Maoist rebels were shot dead by security personnel in the past 24 hours when the two sides clashed at five different places,"" a statement said.
""Three rebels were shot dead at Chovar (on the outskirts of Kathmandu) Saturday morning when they attacked security forces.""
Two others were killed Saturday morning in the southwestern district of Surkhet and the western district of Dhading.
The others were killed in different districts on Friday, the statement said.
The violence came as life was slowly returning to normal in Nepal Saturday on the final day of a five-day strike called by Maoist rebels.
The number of shops open and the amount of traffic on the streets in the capital Kathmandu was near normal, witnesses said.
Kathmandu had been virtually shut down on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the strike called by the rebels to pressure the government to resume peace talks.
Reports from other parts of the country said the shut-down was largely being ignored by Saturday.
On Friday five people were injured when a Maoist rebel threw a bomb at a passenger bus in Kathmandu in an attempt to enforce the strike.
It was one of a string of incidents in the past week that also saw the prime minister's country house burned to the ground, a bomb diffused near the US embassy and nine rebels shot dead by security forces in districts throughout the kingdom on Wednesday and Thursday.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who held three rounds of fruitless negotiations with the rebels last year, has refused to restart talks until the Maoists lay down their arms.
Some 3,100 people have died since the leftist rebels launched their ""people's war"" in 1996, more than a third of them since the rebels broke a four-month ceasefire in November.

The Kathmandu Post said the Nepali government will establish tourism boards in each of the five development regions including eastern, middle, central, western and far western Nepal. All the regional tourism boards will be under the operation of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB), a governmental organization.  
""Since the tourist industry is very important foreign currency earner for Nepal and has been playing a very important role in the country's economy, the government has to take some effective measures to let more tourists come to visit Nepal,"" the daily quoted Birendra Bahadur Deuja, secretary of the Nepali Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOCTCA), as saying.
""Tourist industry is one of the key industries in Nepal and it has been playing a vital role in uplifting the economic status of the local areas,"" Deuja said. ""That is the reason why tourism has been given special emphasis in the government 10th plan which will start from June this year.""
He also noted that the government has also decided to simplify the immigration rules in a bid to let the tourists easily enter into the country. The new rule does not require any visas for the tourists to stay in Nepal for only one day.
Tourism is one of the major foreign currency earners for Nepal, which boasts of unique landscapes and cultures, and earns about 170 million U.S. dollars for the Himalayan country every year.
However, Tourist arrivals in Nepal have declined sharply in recent months. The major reasons are the escalating violence by the anti-government guerrillas in Nepal and the continuing terrorist threats to the world after the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 last year.

"499",20021706,"Title: Nepal PM, under international pressure, says ready to talk to Maoist commander.rtf; Date: July 11, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nepal's caretaker prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, under international pressure to soften his hard line against Maoist rebels, said he is ready to talk to the guerrillas' military commander, officials said Thursday.
Speaking in the mountain resort town of Pokhara, 225 kilometers (140 miles) west of Kathmandu, Deuba said Wednesday he was ready to hold talks with the Maoists' military chief, Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, party officials told AFP.
""I am ready to talk to Badal,"" said Deuba, addressing his first rally outside Kathmandu since his Nepali Congress split into two ahead of early elections in November.
But Deuba remained firm in his refusal to meet with the Maoists' political leadership, including the rebels' elusive supremo Puspa Kamal Dahal -- known as Prachanda, or ""The Fierce"" -- or his top deputy Baburam Bhattarai.
""I won't have any such talks with Maoist leaders Prachanda or Bhattarai, who couldn't even be credited with true leaderhip of the terrorist party as they haven't held any position in their party's guerrilla army rank,"" Deuba said.
Prachanda and Bhattarai are considered the top ideologues behind the Maoist guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1996 to establish a communist republic in the Himalayan kingdom.
Deuba held three rounds of peace talks with the rebels since coming to power in July 2001, but negotiations deadlocked over Maoist demands to scrap the constitutional monarchy.
The guerrillas broke the ceasefire in November with a flurry of attacks. Deuba, saying he felt personally betrayed, has since vowed to crush the Maoists by force.
But sources in Deuba's Nepali Congress party said the prime minister has quietly come under intense pressure on the world stage to moderate his stance.
""Deuba has softened his stance on the matter after Nepal's aid donor countries stressed the view at their meeting in London in mid-June that the Nepalese government should start fresh negotiations with the Maoists to resolve the problems of terrorism in the kingdom,"" a member of the Nepali Congress told AFP.
The London meeting was attended by 14 countries including Britain and the United States, which have both proposed extra military aid to help Nepal's fight against the Maoists, which Deuba has fashioned as part of the global ""war on terrorism.""
The home minister, Khum Bahadur Khadka, on Wednesday said Nepal was ready to resume dialogue with the rebels if they renounce demands for an assembly to redraft the constitution. Previously, Deuba had ruled out talks unless the rebels gave up their arms.
The Maoist insurgency has cost an estimated 4,300-plus lives since 1996, more than two thirds of them since the end of the ceasefire.

Leonardo DiCaprio gawks at celebrities. Not gawks, exactly. He's hardly awed by them, but he watches them like an outsider. He is lounging in the half-shade on a promenade at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, gazing out over a square of perfect green toward the hotel's outdoor restaurant, where celebrated performers are sipping drinks under cream-colored umbrellas and, above those, the high hibiscus that buffers the hotel from the clamor of Sunset Boulevard. ""Man, look at that,"" he says. ""There's a celebrity at every single table out there! Val Kilmer, Heath Ledger, that guy from 'Saturday Night Live.""'
     At 28, DiCaprio has already ridden the entire Hollywood arc of celebrity. After his first feature role, in ""This Boy's Life,"" which also starred Robert De Niro, he was greeted as a Wunderkind; this artiste phase was bolstered by his performances in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""Total Eclipse,"" in which he played the French poet Arthur Rimbaud. With 1997's ""Titanic,"" of course, he attained rock-star status. But Icarus must plummet to earth; that's his job. DiCaprio's next two films were shunned, his pre-""Titanic"" tours de force suddenly a dim memory. Critics thrashed ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and ""The Beach."" Even the public turned against him. Rolling Stone's DiCaprio cover issue at the time was one of the worst-selling in that magazine's history. DiCaprio soon became better known for catting around nightclubs than for acting. No one can be king of the world for long, except for those who die young. 
 But DiCaprio is still breathing, entering what he would never, ever, characterize as his resurrection stage. In the public imagination, he has been off licking his wounds -- though that is hardly the case -- and is now returning with not one but two major films. Next month, he stars in Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me if You Can,"" which will be released within five days of each other. (""Gangs"" arrives on Dec. 20 and ""Catch Me"" on Christmas Day.) ""Gangs,"" in which DiCaprio stars as a dour, furtive Irishman out to avenge his father's death in the Manhattan of the 1860's, is Scorsese's longtime dream project, a brutal allegory for the American experiment and a cinematic elaboration of the Balzacian truism that behind every great fortune lies a great crime. ""Catch Me"" is quite the other thing: a breezy Spielberg romp, offering a once again lithe and charming DiCaprio as a real-life teenage con man who made millions while posing as an airline pilot, lawyer and doctor.
These days, DiCaprio is engaged in an amiable con game of his own -- with the public. He wants to erase the tabloid memories of his past, to reclaim his mantle as a young genius. He doesn't want to discuss his failed romance with Gisele Bundchen, the fashion model, or his reputation as a late-night canoodler. In person, he's easygoing and affable. But talking with him about his career is like playing a careful game of chess, and he always seems to be thinking three moves ahead. He routinely tracks back and reverses phrases he has just spoken; you can see him scrutinizing everything he says, as if he's reading it in imaginary ink. Once freewheeling, even reckless, Leonardo DiCaprio has learned how to play the Hollywood game. 
DiCaprio has also matured in the way he handles his career. He exercises more power in selecting his roles and has made an extremely savvy choice by straddling the Scorsese-to-Spielberg gamut. The two films, and the two DiCaprios, could not be more different. Their diversity is an emblem of the actor's bifurcating persona. ""Gangs"" offers a life-bitten, brooding icon -- an attempt to hack away the trappings of DiCaprio's boyhood fame, as evidenced by the 30 pounds of muscle he gained for the part. He is hardly the sleek romantic lead that mesmerized fans of ""Titanic""; he is driven and scarred. The film, he fiercely hopes, portends a future as a serious adult actor, in which he will be free to break from his dreamboat identity. At the other end of the spectrum, ""Catch Me"" offers perhaps the more natural Leo: unburdened by the weight of ordinary maturity, he plays a teenage boy. More important, ""Catch Me,"" with its combination of Spielberg at the helm and Tom Hanks as co-star, is the perfect career insurance policy. Even if the more daring ""Gangs"" flops, Spielberg's confection, spruced up in swank white dinner jackets and cool sunglasses (and even a touch of doomed love) will be ushered into American multiplexes a few days later. Though the dual release was somewhat accidental, DiCaprio now effectively owns Christmas. There's never been a case in which a major Hollywood star had two films of such prominence sweep the country within one week. This is less a comeback than a full-blown assault.
DiCaprio signed on for ""Catch Me"" soon after embarking on the notoriously troubled, yearlong process of filming ""Gangs."" For ""Titanic,"" he was paid a scant $2.5 million, "
"502",20021844,"Title: Nepal will not reimpose emergency rule_ media rights group.rtf; Date: September 12, 2002 Thursday; Text: Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba assured visiting members of a media rights group that the government will not reimpose a state of emergency that expired last month, the delegation said Thursday.
The International Press Institute (IPI), a Vienna-based body that represents some 2,000 media groups from 150 countries, also said Deuba promised to look into the fate of some 20 journalists who have gone missing under the emergency.
Deuba met with his top advisers Wednesday to consider reimposing the emergency after two days of raids by Maoist rebels left more than 300 people dead, according to tolls provided by defense officials.
But sources close to the premier have said the cabinet decided not to immediately reimpose the controversial emergency, which gave security forces wider powers to impose curfews and to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists.
The IPI said a six-member delegation met Wednesday with Deuba, who gave a commitment ""that Nepal had no intention of reimposing a nationwide state of emergency"".
In a statement, the IPI said more than 130 journalists had been arrested since the government imposed emergency rule in November 2001 and that at least 20 of them were still missing.
""Deuba said he would personally look into the cases of missing journalists since the imposition of the state of emergency,"" the group said.
The emergency was imposed after the Maoists broke a four-month ceasefire with a flurry of attacks. Since then some 2,900 people have been killed, according to government tolls.
The IPI said journalists were ""particularly vulnerable"" in the insurgency as they have been attacked by both the Maoists and government forces.
It proposed the formation of a body to compensate journalists ""who have been unlawfully held or severely mistreated,"" the IPI's director, Austrian journalist Johann P. Fritz, told reporters in Kathmandu.
He said the four-day tour of Nepal by him and five other IPI members served ""the purpose of expressing solidarity with the Nepalese media, who are working under difficult circumstances, and to encourage them to be more forthright in asserting their legal rights"".
Nepal's government has come under particular criticism over the May disappearance of Krishna Sen, the editor of a pro-leftist weekly and a member of the Nepal Journalists Federation's central body.
Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders says Sen was killed in police custody. The government has denied any role in his disappearance.

"503",200283,"Title: WEDDINGS Nancy Jo Johnson, Robert Pfitzenmeier.rtf; Date: June 23, 2002 Sunday; Text: Late Edition - Final 
PATIENCE is a big virtue in Buddhism,"" says Nancy Jo Johnson, a photographer who first visited Nepal in 1980 as a University of Wisconsin undergraduate. She had planned on a semester studying plant life, but stayed five years, living in clay-floored huts, taken in by everything from the rhododendron forests to the philosophies of Tibetan Buddhism to the flavor of yak yogurt.
     Ms. Johnson, now 44 and originally from Madison, Wis., was even more profoundly influenced by the Tibetan refugees she met. Though displaced from their homes and living a bare-bones life, they seemed peaceful and gentle, even content. When she moved to New York in the late 80's, she began studying with a Buddhist lama and organizing treks to the Himalayas. 
 In the mountains, she is not deterred by anything, from snowstorms to complaining trekkers, said Gigi Pucker, her best friend, who met Ms. Johnson in Katmandu, Nepal, in 1982. ""In a very earthy, Midwestern way, Nancy Jo just digs in, gets it done and always smiles,"" said Mrs. Pucker, a fellow trekker and a daughter of the late Jay Pritzker, a founder of Hyatt Hotels.
When Ms. Johnson didn't marry in her 30's, as she had always expected, her resilient nature and Buddhist studies helped. ""I prayed to be patient with the way life unfolded,"" she said. 
In July 1999, while leading a trek at 17,000 feet in the Himalayas, she learned via satellite phone that she was being evicted from her Manhattan loft. Again, she prayed for patience. In November, a friend told her about a studio in an old tobacco-factory-turned-artist-community in Jersey City's warehouse district. She loved the building's rough, ungentrified spirit, its yoga studio, gallery and rooftop, where people gather to view art films.
After Ms. Johnson moved in, a mutual friend introduced her to a sculptor in the building, Robert Pfitzenmeier, who also builds floats for Macy's parades and shows. Known as Pfitz, he is a skier and outdoorsman, having lived in Alaska during the 80's, building houses in grizzly bear territory. ""I slept in a cabin with saw blades mounted on the windowsills to keep the bears from climbing in,"" said Mr. Pfitzenmeier, 55, and twice divorced.
The couple say they did not fall in love overnight, but rather over many pasta dinners in Ms. Johnson's studio, which is decorated with her photographs of Tibetan faces as weathered and cracked as parched earth. 
Ms. Johnson said she knew she wanted to marry him when they traveled to India last summer. ""He adapted really well,"" she said. ""He didn't complain about the food, the heat, the nightmare train stations. He was very gentle with it all.""
He was especially softhearted, she said, when she introduced him to three children whom she had smuggled out of Tibet in 1997, placing them in a boarding school in India. ""The little one immediately began calling Pfitz 'Dad,' "" recalled Ms. Johnson, who hopes to adopt the children one day. ""I was worried that would freak him out, but instead of pushing the child away, Pfitz said he was open to the idea of an immediate family."" 
On June 8, they were married in a Buddhist-Christian ceremony on Mrs. Pucker's farm in Libertyville, Ill., where the 171 guests included a sherpa wearing an embroidered hat, New York artists and Midwestern relatives of the bride. The couple took their vows on the dock of a pond, beneath a sculpture by the bridegroom, surrounded by farm animals, who stood still in wide-open fields. ""Even the cattle looked peaceful,"" said the bride, who wore a Richard Glasgow gown with a golden Mandarin-style overcoat.
The couple hope to be as even-tempered and kind in marriage as they were traveling through 105-degree India. ""We're looking to create a very peaceful household and environment for each other,"" the bride said. ""If you can generate happiness in your own home, it influences the world outside. There's a direct connection.""

"505",2002932,"Title: 14 killed as Maoist rebels blow up bus in Andhra Pradesh.rtf; Date: November 19, 2002 Tuesday; Text: Fourteen people, mostly tribals, were killed when Maoist rebels blew up a bus in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh overnight, police said Tuesday.
Guerrillas of the outlawed People's War Group (PWG) used a remote control device to blow up the bus late Monday in the village of Chintagattu, some 260 kilometers (160 miles) from Hyderabad, provincial capital of Andhra Pradesh.
Police said the rebels had placed a landmine under a culvert in the road.
The Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency quoting unidentified police sources had earlier reported that at least 30 people had been killed in the explosion.
But Nalin Prabhat, superintendent of police in Warangal district, said the number of casualties was lower.
""There was some confusion because of the darkness and the remoteness of the area where the blast took place,"" Prabhat told AFP by telephone.
""In the daylight it has become clear that six men, six women and two children were killed.""
The guerrillas apparently believed the state transport corporation bus was carrying policemen but the majority of the victims were tribals.
Police thought the rebels blew up the bus to avenge the killing of five of their cadres by security personnel on Sunday.
Ten passengers were seriously injured in the blast and the bus was completely destroyed.
The attack comes amid intensified operations by the security forces in the dense Eturunagaram forest against PWG guerrillas, also known as Naxalites.
""Frustrated over the increasing reverses, the PWG has resorted to this desperate act,"" PTI quoted director general of police P. Ramulu as saying.
Police were searching the area for the assailants.
PWG guerrillas have stepped up their campaign against the Andhra Pradesh government and security forces following the breakdown of peace talks in July, after they announced a ceasefire against government forces in March.
The PWG is one of India's oldest and most violent Maoist insurgent groups and although it is banned under the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, it has a sizeable following in Andhra Pradesh.
The rebels have been fighting a three-decade battle for greater social and land rights for the state's indigenous tribal population and landless farmers, in a conflict that has cost more than 10,000 lives.
In September, Andhra Pradesh state Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu ruled out any new ceasefire with the PWG, saying it would only strengthen the rebels.
Nepal has alleged that the PWG and other far-left Indian groups have ties to Maoist rebels waging a ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy in the kingdom.
The conflict has claimed 7,200 lives in Nepal since 1996, according to official figures.

In a press statement distributed to the Nepalese media, Prachanda said all political parties, Nepalese intellectuals, and King Gyanendra should take the initiative the end the civil war and save the nation from collapse.
'Election of a constituent assembly and drawing of a new Constitution for the kingdom would be the key to solution of the crisis,' Prachanda said.
The rebel leader, who has vowed to abolish the Nepalese monarchy, also urged King Gyanendra to make sacrifices in the interest of the country. He did not elaborate the kind of sacrifice he expects from the Nepalese monarch.
Prachanda vowed to intensify its military campaign if King Gyanendra continues with his 'regressive intransigence.'
Chand, who came to office on Oct. 11, said last week he has sent out feelers for peace talks with the rebels and was awaiting a response from them.
The Maoists, who took up arms against the government in 1996, are bent on abolishing the Nepalese monarchy and establish a republican state.

The guerrillas damaged the towers in Khimti and Bhotekoshi in eastern Sindhupalchok district on Tuesday.
An official from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) said it would take at least a week to repair the damage and appealed to people in the area to reduce their consumption of electricity to help avoid power cuts.
""There have been problems with the generation of electricity from Khmiti and Bhotekoshi hydro projects from November 26 onward following disruption of the… transmission line,"" the NEA said in its appeal.
""The NEA is doing its best to find alternative means to mitigate the resulting loss of power,"" it added.
Maoist rebels, who have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996, often target electrical and telecoms infrastructure. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,300 lives in the past six years.

""A group of the guerrillas suddenly attacked at Lalbandi Police Post in Sarlahi district in eastern Terai and killed four policemen and five others were injured during the exchange of fire between the policemen and the guerrillas"", the police officer said, adding that the casualties of the guerrillas is not immediately known, but it was suspected that some of them also been killed.
Meanwhile, the guerrillas also attacked at another police post in Achham district in  midwest of Nepal Saturday night, but the details of the casualties both policemen and the guerrillas is not known, according to official sources.
This is the first time that the guerrillas attacked at the police post in the eastern Terai of Nepal which is adjoining with India since the guerrillas launched its insurgency in more than six-years ago.
More than 600 guerrillas and over 100 government security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
More than  2,300 people, including army soldiers, policemen, civilians and the guerrillas, have been killed since the guerrillas launched the insurgency in the Himalayan Kingdom in 1996.

"512",20021112,"Title: India premier arrives for summit, prepared to snub Pakistani leader.rtf; Date: January 3, 2002 Thursday; Text: Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee arrived Thursday for a South Asian summit in Nepal calling for dialogue rather than war with Pakistan, but ruling out talks until Islamabad curbs support for Islamic militants.
Vajpayee arrived for the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which begins Friday after a two-year delay, after pointedly leaving Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf off a list of leaders he hoped to meet in Kathmandu.
Speaking earlier in the northern Indian city of Lucknow, Vajpayee said no bilateral talks could take place until Islamabad brings ""cross-border terrorism"" to a complete halt.
But he also seemed to disavow war passions among more hawkish members of his government, saying that if ""diplomatic methods can be applied to resolve the existing problems, I don't see why we should resort to other means.""
""I don't think war is a necessity. I will put in all efforts to avoid it,"" Vajpayee told reporters.
India and Pakistan have massed troops along their border in the wake of last month's attack on India's parliament.
India has made clear its dissatisfaction with steps taken by Pakistan under Indian and US pressure to crack down on Islamic militant groups blamed for the December 13 attack.
""It is not possible for us to say that Pakistan is taking such significant action"" against Islamic militants, foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said in Kathmandu.
She said it was up to Pakistan ""to create a climate for (bilateral) dialogue.""
For his part, Musharraf told his National Security Council and cabinet that ""should a mistake of attacking Pakistan be made (India) would regret their decision.""
Musharraf was headed Thursday to key ally Beijing for talks with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in the process avoiding Indian territory on his trip to Kathmandu.
India has banned Pakistan's national air carrier from its airspace and withdrawn its ambassador from Islamabad in the wake of the parliament attack, which New Delhi says was carried out at the behest of Pakistani intelligence.
As foreign ministers of the seven SAARC nations held a second day of talks in Kathmandu to prepare a final summit declaration, an Indian military spokesman said Pakistani and Indian troops traded fire overnight in the hotly disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
The exchange came one day after suspected Muslim militants launched their second attack in three months on Indian Kashmir's state assembly in Srinagar, killing two and injuring 16.
Vajpayee cited Wednesday's grenade attack as evidence that Pakistan ""has no intention to give up on terrorism.""
The half-century Kashmir dispute deadlocked a July summit between Musharraf and Vajpayee in the Taj Mahal city of Agra. The Indian premier refused to see the Pakistani general when the two were in New York last month for the United Nations General Assembly.
Despite the tension, the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers greeted each other warmly at the start of SAARC discussions Wednesday, with India's Jaswant Singh extending his hand to his counterpart Abdul Sattar.
""It was very cordial, no hesitation whatsoever,"" Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando said. ""I would say this is the breaking of the ice.""
Fernando, who met one-and-one Thursday morning with Singh, said the smaller countries of SAARC -- overshadowed by the two ever-hostile giants since the regional bloc's inception in 1985 -- were deeply concerned over escalating Indian-Pakistani tension.
While terrorism is set to be an agenda topic at the Kathmandu summit, the seven SAARC countries -- which account for one-fifth of the world's population and its most impoverished region -- are also due to discuss a host of other issues, including expanding intra-bloc trade and curbing the sexual exploitation of women and children.
Vajpayee, who has insisted he will address SAARC and not relations with Pakistan, acknowledged that the regional bloc has been crippled by the nuclear powers' rivalry.
""It is an uncomfortable truth that as other organizations like ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the EU have marched ahead, SAARC has not been able to achieve the same momentum because we have allowed extraneous issues to retard our program,"" he told Nepal's RSS news agency.
""We must not let political obsessions or mutual rivalries cloud our collective vision of a vibrant and prosperous South Asian community.""

"513",20022575,"Title: Nepal 's forests in danger due to Maoist violence.rtf; Date: November 25, 2002 Monday; Text: The violent Maoist insurgency in Nepal has killed thousands of people and devastated the economy but it is now threatening the Himalayan kingdom's environment in the form of its precious forests, officials say.
Forest guards cannot protect the forests from illegal felling because they are worried about attacks by Maoist rebels, while the government is unable to dedicate enough funds for forest conservation, they say.
Some 92 area forest offices and 696 range posts are engaged in conservation programmes in the 5.8 million hectares (14.3 million acres) of land in Nepal which is covered in forest -- about 39.6 percent of the total area of the Himalayan kingdom.
""Altogether 20 forest area offices and 280 range posts have already been destroyed by the Maoists since they launched their armed insurgency,"" a senior official of the forestry ministry told AFP.
Some 7,200 people have died since the rebels began their struggle to overthrow the monarchy in 1996. They often attack government offices and industrial installations and have caused some eight billion rupees (more than 100 million dollars) of damage, according to government figures.
""The forest guards are not even able to do their routine job of entering the forests for fear of encountering the Maoists,"" the official said.
""To avert the anger of the outlawed rebels, similar other offices have been shifted to safer places within their respective district headquarters areas,"" the official said, adding that this aided smugglers who illegally cut down trees to sell for timber.
President of the Rangers' Association of Nepal (RAN), Anchal Dhunanga, added: ""The rangers are not allowed to carry weapons by the security forces fearing that the weapons may be looted by the insurgents.""
The fear of Maoist attacks has forced donor-aided forest projects in the country's western regions, a Maoist stronghold, to be largely abandoned, he said.
Secretary for Forestry and Soil Conservation, Chandika Prasad Shrestha, said that in monetary terms, the Maoists had destroyed forestry infrastructure worth 3.84 million dollars.
""On the question of reconstruction of the destroyed forest infrastructure, we are waiting for the restoration of peace,"" Shrestha said.
On top of this, the reduced allocations for forestry projects in the government's current 2002-03 budget has also forced the complete closure of several projects.
The allocation of just 625 million rupees (eight million dollars) for the development of the forest sector is 30 million rupees less than last year, officials said.
""If the situation does not change for the better, this sector will face disaster. The depletion of the forest resources at present stands at 1.7 percent of the country's gross domestic production (GDP) a year,"" said Dhunanga.
""The effect of the present situation may be long-lasting, forcing conservation efforts to be pushed back 30 years as the Maoist insurgency has destroyed various grassroots infrastructure,"" he said.
But it is not only the Maoists who are threatening the forests. People living near forested areas are also encroaching on nearly 70,000 hectares (172,900 acres) of forestland, an assistant officer of the government Forest Development Project, Santosh Neupane, said.
However, the forest officials have restored 15,000 hectares of such encroached lands bringing them under the government control, he said.

Addressing the public on national television late Friday, Deuba said his controversial decision to dissolve parliament Wednesday and hold elections two years early was necessary to battle a violent Maoist insurgency.
With parliament set to reject a six-month extension of emergency rule, which gives authorities greater power to detain and interrogate suspected Maoists, Deuba said he was left with little choice.
""The Maoist terrorists are killing and looting the innocent people and bombing the hostels and educational institutions of orphans,"" he said.
""There was no alternative but to dissolve parliament and seek a fresh mandate from the people through elections.""
The abrupt move was attacked from across the political spectrum and the Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala Thursday urged all ministers to resign within three days. Three have but the remaining 34 swung their support behind their leader.
The Maoist rebellion has cost more than 4,000 lives since 1996 -- more than half of them since the guerrillas broke a truce in November last year, prompting the emergency.

"515",2002868,"Title: Nepali Travelers Cross Mudslides.rtf; Date: August 24, 2002 Saturday; Text: First there was just one car, whose driver stopped and stared at the lake of mud. Then a bus stopped. Within an hour Saturday afternoon, dozens of vehicles were parked on either side of the mudslide.
When the hill gave way above the Araniko Highway, slopping a few tons of soupy muck onto the asphalt, there was nothing any of the travellers blocked by the slide could do, unless they were willing to get very muddy.
So that's what they did, goading each other through the waist-high mud and laughing at those who tried it, in one of the few light moments of a monsoon season that has brought little but despair to this Himalayan kingdom.
The monsoon rains have killed more than 500 people in Nepal in the past month, most of them in landslides. Even when not lethal, the mudslides can seriously hamper daily life.
The slide happened in the early afternoon under a steady rain on this highway, which runs from Katmandu, Nepal's capital, to the Chinese border along the valley of the Bhote Koshi River.
As cars and buses piled up, umbrellas burst open as travelers stepped out into the rain to examine their predicament. Two growing communities blossomed quickly on each side of the mudslide, which spread about 75 wide across the road as it flowed down into the river.
At first, dozens of people standing in the rain looked glumly to the other side, with just a few willing to poke their way across. The crowd saw what happened to the first few explorers, most of whom took at least 20 minutes to make it and emerged coated in mud. As the rain let up, though, and it became obvious that no bulldozers were racing to this isolated spot to help, the mood lightened.
Two men argued about whether a motorcyclist could drag his bike to the other side. He could. A young man in tattered clothes reached out to help a grinning woman in an elegant sari picking her way across. A small crowd laughed good-naturedly when a young girl in pink pants slipped from a trail and into the muck, wailing for her mother.
Landslides are common during the rainy season along Nepal's mountain roads. Road-clearing equipment is rare in this, one of the world's poorest countries. During the three-month rainy season, normally ending in mid-September, many find themselves again and again waiting out slides.
There is even a transportation system to cope with blocked roads. When buses can't get through, the passengers get off one bus, slog across the mud and get into another on the other side, taking over seats left by passengers heading the opposite direction. The buses then turn around and head back the way they came.
If the bus conductors are feeling generous, they'll negotiate partial refunds or discounts. No matter what, though, the passengers come out the losers.
""We'll fight for our refund,"" said Pemba Lama, a Katmandu resident heading to a rural village. ""But even if he gives us some money, we'll still be ripped off, and have to pay more to get back to our village.""
After about an hour, a road crew finally showed up: three men with broken shovels and a foreman wearing a beat-up yellow construction hat. They quickly realized this job was too much for them.
""Mud this deep, we can barely walk across. Cleaning it away is beyond our might,"" said the foreman, Jit Bahadur Majhi, who said he believed a bulldozer would eventually arrive.
For some, the crew's failure was far from funny. Hundreds of people were inconvenienced by the mudslide. For some the situation was dire.
Padam Rasayili, a Katmandu curio vendor, was heading to his village to see his wife, sick with respiratory troubles. He'd arrived on a motorcycle, but didn't think he could get it across.
""I have to go home as soon as possible,"" he said, eyeing the mud. ""I don't know what I'm going to do.""

The foreign maids would be taxed up to 96.3 dollars a month under the tax, proposed by pro-business and pro-China parties to help fight the economic downswing.
Philippine labor attache to Hong Kong Bernardino Julve said in a statement that Manila's consul general, Victoria Batacan, was asking Thailand and Indonesia to team up with the Philippines to submit a joint position paper against the proposed levy.
""They are also concerned. We would be seeking colleagues from other embassies. We have to take the lead. We have no choice because we have the most number of domestic workers on the line,"" Julve was quoted as saying.
He added that foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong will stage a protest march against the levy on December 15.
Manila hopes to submit the position paper before Hong Kong begins its traditional review of wages of foreign domestic workers in December, Julve added.
About 60 percent, or 153,000, of Hong Kong's foreign domestic workers are Filipinos and their remittances back home are a major source of foreign exchange for this impoverished country.
There are about 75,000 Indonesians and 7,000 Thais also working as domestic helpers there, with smaller numbers from Nepal and Bangladesh.

Ministry spokesman Bhupendra Poudel said 11 rebels were killed Saturday during intense fighting in Mahadevpuri village in Banke district, about 312 miles (502 kilometers) west of Katmandu.
In scattered fighting elsewhere, 27 guerrillas were shot dead on Friday and Saturday, Poudel said, adding that there were no casualties on the government side.
And, ""at least 50 rebels were killed in the clashes with our soldiers at Khara village on Thursday,"" Poudel said. The area is nearly 250 miles (402 kilometers) west of the Nepalese capital.
The government routinely reports high rebel battle casualties and low army losses. Casualty reports cannot be independently verified, as gunbattles often occur in remote mountain areas closed by the authorities to outsiders. The rebels, in hiding, generally do not comment on the fighting.
Clashes between the government and rebels has intensified in recent months, with the army joining police in a campaign to root out rebel fighters from strongholds in remote mountainous areas.
More than 4,000 people have been killed since 1996, when the rebels began fighting in a bid to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy. The rebels draw their inspiration from the Chinese revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong.

"518",2002345,"Title: Nepalese army withdrawing from two positions, braces for big Maoist attack.rtf; Date: May 11, 2002 Saturday; Text: After a ferocious battle against waves of drum-beating, screaming guerrillas, Nepal's army was short of men and weapons and said Saturday it was girding for another major attack and withdrawing from two of its five positions in the western guerrilla stronghold.
Around the village of Gam, site of a deadly Maoist rebel attack last Tuesday, the bloated bodies of guerrillas lay half buried. On a remote and densely forested mountain, little was left of the joint army-police base that the rebels attacked and then burned down.
Officers of the Royal Nepalese Army and a Western defense attache took a group of journalists to the war zone for the first time on Saturday. They said that last week's fighting had yielded valuable intelligence about the Maoist set up and plans.
The fighting that began last Thursday was described as the bloodiest in the six-year insurgency that has killed more than 3,500 people in this impoverished Himalayan kingdom.
Precise casualty figures are unclear, although officials say several hundred rebels and about 70 soldiers and police were killed in two major operations - one by the army and two counterattacks by guerrillas.
A top army general said the army would begin pulling out later in the day, or on Sunday, from Gam and Thawang, two other areas in the remote western district of Rolpa, 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Katmandu, the capital.
""This is a tactical withdrawal,"" the general told reporters on condition of anonymity. ""We had two choices, either to reciprocate or withdraw … We chose the latter, to have sufficient troops for a larger operation.""
On the terraced hills of Gam, journalists were shown the partially dug up bodies of 10 men, two in rebel uniforms and the rest in civilian clothes. Another 14 bodies appeared to have been thrown down a cliff.
A letter that the army said was found in the pocket of one of the dead rebels was addressed to a ""Commander Sanjay"" from a ""Comrade Sonam.""
""We are running out of cash. We want 2.5 million rupees (dlrs 32,500),"" the letter said. ""We are getting by on one meal per day. The men are getting desperate.""
""Things aren't going the way they want,"" the defense attache said. ""They have lost command and control and discipline.""
In Gam, there were burned huts, scattered helmets, shoes and bullets where soldiers and police had been overwhelmed by waves of guerrillas. They beat drums, screamed taunts and exploded crude bombs as they advanced, according to survivors.
The commander at Gam showed reporters some string, saying it had been used to tie the hands and feet of one of his senior officers, who was slashed repeatedly in the neck, and shot in the head.
The army officers said documents recovered from some of the hastily buried bodies of guerrillas indicate another big attack is being planned.
The documents also indicate that the rebels are growing desperate. They have taken at least 1,500 casualties among their 5,000-6,000 hardcore fighters in the past few months, the general said.
The documents, some of which were shown to The Associated Press, mention that the next attack would be at ""Delta One.""
The army believes the attack will be at Libang, also in the Rolpa district where the rebels have operated freely for years.
Libang, with several hundred soldiers guarding it, was recaptured by the army in the past few months, after King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency and ordered a fierce offensive to crush the rebellion.
Both Gam and Thawang are in the heartland of Maoist territory, where they ran a parallel ""People's Government"" for six years - collecting taxes, settling land disputes and robbing banks.
Gam, at 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), is the area where Nepal's most wanted man - Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known as ""Prachanda,"" or ""fierce one"" in Nepali - began the rebel movement in 1996, aiming to topple Nepal's constitutional democracy and redistribute land.
Thawang was designated the capital of their Maoist state, which was to be based on the doctrines of Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong.
Intelligence gathering, a shortage of men, weapons and ammunition, and the lack of adequate training to fight an insurgency are the main problems facing the campaign that King Gyanendra ordered in November.
Nepal's 52,000-strong army has participated in several international peacekeeping missions, but has never taken part in operations at home.
""We will return when we have adequate resources. Currently we are very thinly spread,"" said the general, adding that the army needed at least four months to get together more weapons and men.
Nepal will have trained 6,000 new soldiers by later this year.
Katmandu is also seeking helicopters, 50,000 M-16 assault rifles, communication equipment and night vision devices from the United States.

Fifteen Maoist insurgents were shot in battles in five different places in the Bardia district in far-western Nepal, the ministry said, adding that the gunbattles broke out after security forces raided rebel shelters.
Troops also recovered a large cache of arms and explosives from the insurgents.
In Rolpa district in mid-western Nepal, four people were slain during a search-and-destroy operation by security forces. A rebel commander of the district was among those killed, the ministry said.

"522",2002767,"Title: A noble, global idea ties a Minnesota couple in knots.rtf; Date: NA; Text: Colleagues scoffed, relatives worried and his own analysis showed Orlyn Kringstad that getting into the rug-making business would be risky and difficult.
But his friend Arthur B. Schultz, a wealthy businessman whose philanthropy includes building schools for Sherpas in Nepal, asked him to try. So two years ago, Kringstad accepted Schultz's challenge and some of his money, setting up a company they hoped would reduce the number of Nepalese children forced to work weaving Oriental carpets for export around the world.
It's a problem not just in Nepal, but India, Pakistan and other countries where rugs are woven by hand for export to buyers in affluent countries. An estimated 1 million to 2 million children under age 14 are working in Nepal, chiefly in agriculture, but also in rug factories and other manufacturing.
""We know we won't be changing the world with our little drop in the bucket,"" Kringstad said. ""What we think we can do is to stop some of the slave labor.""
But rather than compete head-on in the already saturated Oriental carpet business, Kringstad tried a different strategy - instead of selling traditional Oriental carpets, he asked Scandinavian artists for designs aimed at consumers looking for something fresh and contemporary.
""I thought the only way we can do this is to try to build a mystique in this product,"" Kringstad said.
When Schultz first approached him, Kringstad was working as development chief for Sons of Norway, a Minneapolis-based fraternal and insurance organization for descendants of Norwegian immigrants. But at age 56, he wanted a new career before retirement. Schultz's idea appealed to him, and Kringstad's wife, Marit, a social worker, joined him, eager to make a dent in a big problem overseas.
Their business, Nordic Textiles and Furnishings, is an example of globalization in action, using the Internet, air shipping and capital from a handful of investors in Europe and Minnesota. They juggle middle-of-the-night e-mail and faxes, long trips to Nepal and Norway, tax and accounting procedures of three countries and differences in culture and language.
To help carry out their mission of employing only adults and not children, Schultz introduced the Kringstads to a former mountain guide in Nepal, Dorjee Sushil Sherpa, whom they hired to oversee production.
The Kringstads asked Sherpa to adhere to hiring practices and workplace standards promoted by Rugmark, a Washington-based organization that opposes child labor and certifies manufacturers who only employ adults. Rugmark makes random inspections of factories in Nepal to check compliance.
They made a fast start, bringing carpets to market in March 2001, just seven months after meeting with Lise Skjak Braek, a Norwegian designer who agreed to create their first collection.
She took ideas from wooden jewelry boxes, ancient stone carvings, silver buttons and church tapestries for her designs. Many are simpler than traditional Oriental rugs, but a few are as complex as stained-glass windows.
The production chief says workers notice the difference.
""Some of those designs are hard to weave,"" Sherpa said in an e-mail interview. But, he added, workers ""also feel that hard designs are really beautiful.""
Along with carpets, the Kringstads import furniture and clothes from Scandinavia and pashmina scarves from Nepal. They sell the merchandise to about 40 retailers across the country and in a small store of their own in this Minneapolis suburb. A 5-foot by 7-foot carpet sells for $1,300.
The venture has had its bumpy moments, ranging from mildly inconvenient to near-disastrous.
In one linguistic mishap, the Kringstads ordered 200 little balls of wool as color samples to show customers, but the carpets themselves later arrived in shades that weren't quite what they expected. The explanation: The carpets used a different kind of wool than the samples.
A short time after the debut of the carpets, one of the Kringstads' investors pulled out, forcing them to decide whether to close. By then, they were already employing dozens of adults in Nepal and providing daycare for their children.
So the Kringstads dug into their retirement accounts, rewrote their business plan and picked up some other investors. ""We didn't want to abandon our commitment,"" Orlyn Kringstad said.
Then, when the market for hand-woven carpets and other luxury goods collapsed after Sept. 11, dozens of factories closed, including the one contracted by the Kringstads. Sherpa and his wife, Ang Lami, scrambled to find another with enough capacity, delaying shipments for three to four weeks.
The Kringstads hope to build a factory of their own in Nepal next year, along with a daycare center and school they'll make available to children of workers from nearby factories.
Orlyn Kringstad said his reliance on adult labor provides a marketing edge. However, it is possible that advantage will fade as more manufacturers feel pressured to stop using children and seek Rugmark cert"
"523",2002861,"Title: ROUNDUP_ Guerrillas-Govt Forces Fighting Escalates in Nepal by Song Dejun.rtf; Date: March 1, 2002, Friday; Text: Fighting between the Nepali anti- government guerrillas and the government security forces has been escalating in recent days as the guerrillas wanted to show its strength to both the people and the government during the period of the state of emergency.
The heaviest loss for the government security forces occurred on February 17. According to a press release issued by the Nepali Defense Ministry, more than 130 security personnel including policemen, army soldiers and local government officials, were killed by the guerrillas in Achham district, in the far west of the country.
In addition, more than 200 civilians were also killed by the guerrillas in the same district on the same day, according to a high-placed army officer, who added that at least four policemen were killed and five others injured earlier on the same day when a group of the anti-government guerrillas suddenly attacked a police post in Sarlahi district in the east of the country.
He also confirmed that the communications line between Mangalsen and Dipayal areas in Sarlahi district had been cut off by the guerrillas, so that the government security forces could not get any information from that district and the security personnel could not get there to support the security forces who were fighting with the guerrillas.
It was reported that the attacks by the anti-government guerrillas at the security forces on February 17 were the worst since the Nepali government declared the state of emergency.
The Nepali government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long ceasefire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
Under such a situation, the Nepali cabinet members held an emergency meeting on the night of that day, and decided to order the security forces to use all means to crush the anti-government forces. The government also called upon all the fellow countrymen to raise the morale of the security agencies and to extend necessary cooperation in the performance of security-related activities in view of the gravity of the present situation.
Four days later, on February 21, the Nepali parliament endorsed the extension of the state of emergency for another three months in order to crush the anti-government guerrillas throughout the country, as proposed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba with a view to rooting out the guerrillas in the country.
On the same day, the government security forces killed at least 48 and arrested 15 guerrillas across the country in the course of cordon and search operations. The security personnel killed another 76 guerrillas members in various parts of the country in the early morning on February 24, and also arrested dozens of the guerrillas and seized a large amount of weapons and explosive materials across the country.
More than 600 anti-government guerrillas and over 200 government security personnel have been killed since the Nepali government imposed the state of emergency, according to the statistics by the defense ministry.
The six-year-long guerrillas insurgency has claimed more than 2, 500 lives, including army soldiers, policemen, civilians and the guerrillas, in the Himalayan kingdom.          
""The Nepali government has committed to rooting out all the guerrillas terrorists through out the country,"" Prime Minister Deuba said to the public the other day. ""The fight will definitely be long and will have its ups and downs. But this will not deter us from crushing terrorism.""
""The Nepali government now has support from both national and international communities as well as all the political parties of the country, so I am confident that we will defeat the terrorists in our country,"" Deuba noted.
However, some politicians believed that it is not easy to root out the anti-government guerrillas in a short period of time and only by the government security forces.
They suggested that the government mobilize all the Nepalese people to participate in fighting against the guerrillas and get support from all the political workers, people and organization.  Only in this way, the government can crush all the anti-government forces finally, they said.

The two leaders are due to attend the second high-level political summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), a regional grouping of 16 Asian, Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations.
According to senior officials, both Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf have confirmed their participation in the conference expected to be held between June 2-5.
But it is likely to be an opportunity missed, as there is little possibility the two leaders will hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of the summit, although Pakistan has expressed a willingness for such dialogue.
Since a deadly attack on the Indian parliament in December last year, New Delhi has stoutly rejected Pakistan's offer to resume bilateral dialogue, saying it must first end alleged ""cross-border terrorism"" in disputed Kashmir.
India blamed the parliament attack on two Pakistan-based militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir and since then both sides have massed hundreds of thousands of troops on their border.
The two leaders last came face-to-face during a South Asian regional summit in Nepal in January, when Musharraf shook Vajpayee's hand after making a speech.
The last bilateral talks were in July last year in the Taj Mahal city of Agra when they failed to reach an agreement on the vexed Kashmir dispute.
On Wednesday, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh reiterated India's position during a debate in parliament.
India will talk to Pakistan only if it ends ""cross-border terrorism"" and has no ""animosity towards this country,"" he said.
""… talks can be held to improve relations and not just as an exercise in public relations,"" Singh added, referring to the Musharraf's recent statement that he was prepared to have talks ""anywhere, anytime.""
Vajpayee has also ruled out any resumption of dialogue.
""There is no basis for resumption of talks till cross-border terrorism stops,"" Vajpayee said in March.
""Every time terrorism is taken up for discussion by the world community, Pakistan finds itself in the dock.""
CICA was set up in Kazakhstan in 1992 but has not held a political summit at the head of state level since then.
Next month's conference, which was due to be held in November last year but was postponed after the September 11 attacks in the US, will have a ""special focus"" on international terrorism, according to sources.
Among the CICA members are Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, Egypt besides other Central Asian Republics. The CIS includes the former Soviet republics, except the Baltic states.
All 16 members are expected to be represented by their heads of state while the United States and the United Nations will be invited as observers along with Japan and other nations outside the region.
Singh attended the first ministerial-level meeting of the conference in 1999.
The Indian prime minister is also expected to pay a bilateral visit to Turkey en route to Almaty.
Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev visited India in February.

"526",20022093,"Title: Rescuers still unable to reach mountain village in Nepal where 65 people feared dead from landslide.rtf; Date: August 22, 2002 Thursday; Text: Rescuers were still waiting Thursday for rains to clear so they could reach a mountain village in eastern Nepal, where a landslide was feared to have killed at least 65 people.
Monsoon floods and landslides have wreaked havoc in the Himalayan kingdom, neighboring Indian states and the low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh. Over 1,000 people have died and more than 25 million have been displaced since June.
""We are still waiting for the weather to clear up,"" Devendra Kadel, junior interior minister, said as a Russian-built MI-16 cargo helicopter loaded with blankets, food and medicine remained grounded at the airport in the Nepalese capital, Katmandu.
Incessant rain and dense fog on Wednesday had forced rescuers to abandon their mission to the landslide site in the village of Thapra, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Katmandu.
Low visibility and poor light make it too risky for the helicopters to be maneuvered through the mountains. The only way to reach the remote village is by mountain trails. There are no telephones and the nearest town is a two-day walk.
Most residents were asleep when the landslide struck early Wednesday.
Initial reports said 40 houses were swept away and at least 65 people were reported missing. A local Red Cross worker said details were sketchy, but that there could be as many as 100 people buried by the mudslide.
""We don't even know how bad the damage is or what state the people are in. We have not received any more information from the village,"" said Trilok Prasad Shrestha, the top government officer of Ramechap district, which covers the village of Thapra.
Shrestha said they had rescuers ready at the town of Banthali, the district headquarters, but they needed helicopters to take them to the village. One team of rescuers had left Banthali on foot Wednesday, but they were unlikely to reach the village Thursday, he said.
Wednesday's landslide struck as the Nepalese government said it was wrapping up rescue efforts as the weather had improved.
Among the more than 1,000 killed in South Asia since monsoon rains began in June, 494 have been in Nepal. Most fatalities have occurred in remote mountainous areas accessible only by helicopters. Other areas have been cut off as torrential rains have washed away roads.
Many of Nepal's swollen rivers that flow through India before draining into the Bay of Bengal have caused severe floods in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, where at least 327 people have either been swept away by floodwaters or died of waterborne diseases.
In all, monsoon floods have killed at least 391 people in India and damaged millions of hectares (acres) of crops. Another 158 people have died in neighboring Bangladesh.
The weather outlook appeared mixed. The central Water Commission forecast moderate rains for the eastern Bihar state. Meanwhile, the declining intensity of rains in Nepal was helping some rivers downstream in India to recede.

The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on five different police outposts, killing seven policemen in Lamki late Tuesday, but attacks at other outposts were repulsed by police, the radio said.
Eight other policemen were also injured in Lamki, it said.
The government imposed emergency measures last November and ordered the army to fight the rebels waging an armed insurgency to overthrow the Nepalese monarchy and end parliamentary rule.
While the army has killed hundreds of guerrillas of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) in clashes across the country in the past four months, rebel have been continuing attacks, ravaging the countryside of the Himalayan kingdom.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 and nearly 4,000 Nepalese have died in the armed rebellion since then.

The fighting took place at Rumjatar airport near the Mount Everest region 290 kilometres (180 miles) northeast of Kathmandu.
Eight other soldiers were injured, while defence sources said as many as 40 Maoists could have been wounded.
""A fairly a large group of Maoist terrorists had attacked the Rumjatar airport lying closer to the Mount Everest region and fierce fighting took place for several hours,"" a defence source said.
Rebels overnight attacked offices of the district civilian administration in the Solu region, also near Mount Everest, but were driven off by army reinforcements were using helicopters with night-vision equipment.
The guerrillas also attacked a police post in the Sarlahi district, 240 kilometres (149 miles) south of Kathmandu, an interior ministry official said.
""We are waiting for a detailed report on the Sarlahi incident and we will be in a position to tell only later in the afternoon about the real situation,"" he said.

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had sought to steal the spotlight at the summit on Saturday, departing from his prepared speech to offer, verbally and physically, ""a hand of sincere, genuine friendship"" towards Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
""Let us together commence a journey of peace, harmony and progress in South Asia,"" Musharraf said and later walked up to Vajpayee chair's on the summit podium and shook his hand, to the surprise and applause of the audience.
For once, however, the Indian side was not caught unawares.
According to reports in the Indian press, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra swiftly moved to make changes in Vajpayee's own speech, delivered just minutes later.
In his address, the Indian leader welcomed Musharraf's handshake, but added that gestures must be matched by actions and Pakistan should not allow its soil to be used by militant groups ""to perpetrate mindless violence"" in India.
According to convention, bilateral issues are not openly discussed at meetings of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
""India was not surprised at the dramatic public relations excercise by the Pakistan president,"" said C. Raja Mohan, strategic affairs editor of the Hindu newspaper.
""India was indeed expecting some move by (Musharraf) and was prepared to respond quickly.""
Lessons, it seemed, had been learned from last July's Vajpayee-Musharraf summit in Agra, when the Pakistan president stole the show with an eloquent and hard-talking televised breakfast meeting with Indian newspaper editors.
While Pakistani officials had regularly briefed the media at Agra, their Indian counterparts had remained uncomfortably quiet.
Vajpayee himself admitted later during a cabinet meeting that India had been found wanting in its public relations excercise in the Taj Mahal city.
Determined to avoid the same mistakes, Indian diplomats were ""over-accessible"" to journalists at Kathmandu, the Asian Age newspaper reported.
Indian television channels ran sound bites with both Jaswant Singh and his spokesperson Nirupama Rao at regular intervals during the two-day summit.
The Indian side was also quick to deny a ""substantive"" exchange between Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Adbul Sattar on Saturday, after Pakistan officials said they had met and discussed bilateral issues.

Fed by high water that struck the Czech capital of Prague earlier this week, the Elbe rose above 29 1/2 feet Friday, carrying refrigerators, sofas and cars as its swirling waters engulfed one neighborhood after the other. It was expected to crest Saturday.
A total of 33,000 Dresden residents were forced to leave their homes by Friday, police said. The death toll from two weeks of flooding across Europe rose to 104 as two more victims were found in the Czech Republic and one in Austria Friday,
In Dresden, firefighters evacuated Christine Fritzsch, 69, and her neighbors from their apartment house at 1 a.m. to a middle school across town.
Sitting on camp beds in a school classroom Friday evening, they said they had watched the water approach the front steps. Their TV sets blinked out, then their telephones went dead.
""Then I knew that we had to get out,"" she said.
""We were well prepared, they warned us several times so we could get our things ready,"" said Hildegard Paulus, 75. Along with a few clothes and toiletries, she'd brought her favorite family photos to safety.
Sandbags were running out in Dresden as residents young and old guarded their streets from the muddy tide with thick walls.
""You have to always add more. Every half an hour we added another layer, but it's hard to say if it's enough,"" said Richard Schutze, 49, his hands cut from hauling the burlap sacks.
Earlier Friday, emergency workers were forced to give up efforts to pump the basement of Dresden's famed 19th-century Semper Opera, leaving stage sets, sheet music and instruments stored below ground to a watery fate.
Next door in the Zwinger Palace museum, thousands of priceless artworks by the old masters were stacked eight to ten deep in their gilded frames on the museum's upper floors.
""It's quite incredible that we saved everything,"" said Martin Roth, the general director of Dresden's museums. ""Next week everybody will probably collapse.""
Bridges spanning the Elbe were closed to all but emergency traffic.
Water was rising to the second floor of homes in Meissen, 12 miles downstream from Dresden. Shopkeepers and homeowners feared looting as electricity and gas were cut and people were forced to flee the town.
Desperate residents in Bitterfeld fought to contain waters from a swollen lake threatening to engulf their town. Already 1,300 people had evacuated their homes.
Some of the 350 plants in east Germany's largest chemical industry complex in Bitterfeld moved chemicals to higher ground and partly shut down as a precaution. But a spokesman for the sprawling facility, Matthias Gabriel, said it was not at risk from floodwaters from the Mulde river - an Elbe tributary - about 4 miles away.
Further north, Germans braced for the Elbe's high waters to spill over into cities and towns on its way to the North Sea. Tens of thousands of residents in the central eastern city of Magdeburg and in Brandenburg state, surrounding Berlin, packed up valuables and moved furniture to their upper floors.
Floodwaters are expected to reach there over the weekend, despite a mostly sunny weather forecast. Authorities appealed to people to evacuate before the water reached their front doors.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, struggling in his campaign for a second term in Sept. 22 elections, spoke of a ""national catastrophe"" and promised to spearhead a rebuilding effort.
He said that the damage to infrastructure, property and farming will total billions of dollars in Germany alone.
Receding waters in the Czech Republic revealed the bodies to two victims, a motorist swept away by the flood and a 44-year-old who drowned. A German tourist was found dead in Austria, where he had been vacationing when the floods hit. Most casualties were in Russia, where 59 mostly Russian tourists died.
In Prague, city officials were still refusing to let people return to the Old Town on Friday, fearing unstable buildings and palaces would collapse. Much of the city is built on sand, which could be swept away with the retreating waters leaving buildings on unstable foundations.
The U.S. government donated $50,000 to the Czech Red Cross for immediate humanitarian assistance, as well pumps, drying and other equipment, the U.S. Embassy in Prague said. The United States has also offered to assist in repair and restoration for the historic Kampa Island.
Austrians began cleaning up mud and debris scattered in homes and streets of villages in the wake of the swollen Danube. Slovaks breathed easier as the major flooding from the raging Danube bypassed the capital Bratislava, but Hungary was bracing for high water to hit Budapest.

Some 1.5 million of the estimated 20 million people living close to rivers in the worst-hit states of Bihar and Assam have also been displaced by the disaster.
The federation said the money would help the Indian Red Cross provide food, shelter and medical care for 200,000 people in the two states over six months.
Altogether, over 800 people have been killed in monsoon floods and landslides across South Asia, with millions left homeless in Bangladesh, Nepal and India -- while other parts of India are suffering their worst drought in 15 years.

Bihar state has borne the brunt of the lashing monsoon rains which have swept through the region for the past three weeks, with 46 people dead and some four million left homeless, according to state relief and rehabilitation minister, Ramvichar Rai.
The flood situation was equally grim in neighbouring Assam, where two children drowned Friday while stepping off a rescue boat, bringing the death toll there to eight.
""Roughly 2.2 million people have been made homeless after the floods hit 3,000 villages in 16 out of Assam's 23 districts,"" Assam Flood Control Minister Nurzamal Sarkar told AFP Friday.
Six people, meanwhile, have died in landslides in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram states.
Authorities have blamed the overloading of boats as a cause for the large number of casualties in Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states.
""A large number of private and commercial boats plying in thousands all over the flood-affected parts are illegal, without valid government licenses,"" a local official said.
""They are usually makeshift boats and often, in the urge to make a fast buck, the boatmen load them beyond capacity causing them to turn turtle,"" he said.
Local media said a boat carrying 35 people had capsized in the strong currents of Koshi river in Supaul district, 400 kilometres (248 miles) northeast of Bihar's capital Patna.
At least 30 people were feared dead as only five were able to swim to safety.
Four children also drowned in Bihar while trying to loot relief supplies airdropped by an army helicopter, an official said.
They included two girls and a 14-year-old, the official said.
In another accident, seven people were reported to have been swept away by the surging waters near Kamrauli village, 250 kilometres (154 miles) from Patna, while five people drowned in Sitamarhi district, newspapers said.
Relief and rehabilitation minister Rai said 12,200 hectares (30,000 acres) of croplands had been affected and 728 houses had collapsed.
In Assam's Morigaon district, 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of the state capital Guwahati, 12 relief camps were washed away overnight, said magistrate Pervez Shah.
""At least 400,000 people are homeless here,"" said Shah.
An AFP correspondent saw hundreds of flood victims living on the highway with nothing but flimsy plastic sheets to protect themselves from incessant rains.
Thousands of endangered animals have also fled floods in the world-renowned Kaziranga National Park in Assam.
""At least a dozen animals have drowned or been killed after being hit by cars while crossing the national highway to move towards the adjoining Karbi Anglong Hills,"" said D.D Boro, a Kaziranga park ranger.
""The park is completely submerged and all the animals are migrating in large herds to the hills,"" he added.
The 430-square-kilometer (172 square-mile) park, east of Assam's capital Guwahati, boasts 1,600 of a total world population of 2,300 one-horned rhinos. It also has a large population of deer, bison and endangered Asian elephants.
More than 300 people have died around South Asia this week in flooding and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains, most of them in Nepal.
Other parts of India, meanwhile, have been experiencing their worst drought in a decade.

The government released on Tuesday the two rights activists, Pramod Kafle and physician Mahesh Maskey, and Shyam Shrestha, editor of left-wing monthly magazine Mulyankan (""Evaluation"").
The three were arrested on March 16 at Kathmandu's airport as they prepared to board a flight to New Delhi. They were accused of planning to participate in a seminar organized by the People's War Group, a banned far-left movement fighting Indian landowners.
The government also released Gopal Budhathoki, editor and publisher of the Sanghu (""Bridge"") weekly, who was arrested by security personnel on his way home from the office on March 3.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba told parliament Budhathoki was trying to demoralize the army with his articles.
Budhathoki, who was also arrested last year for publishing a piece on Maoist leaders, issued a statement Wednesday refuting the charges.
""I have been fighting against social injustice and corruption and for the democratic rights in the country so the question of my attempts to demoralize the army fighting against Maoist terrorism does not arise,"" Budhathoki said.
Deuba's government imposed a state of emergency on November 26 and appealed to the media not to encourage Maoist rebels, who had broken a four-month ceasefire two days earlier.
But alleged excesses under the state of emergency have been strongly criticized by opposition parties, Nepalese rights groups and international organizations.
Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said Wednesday that some 30 reporters were being detained by the Nepalese authorities, more than any other country, and complained of restricted media access.
More than 2,700 people have died since the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" to topple the constitutional monarchy in 1996.

"535",20021138,"Title: Hopes dim for Indian - Pakistani summit as South Asia summit delayed.rtf; Date: January 4, 2002 Friday; Text: Indian and Pakistani leaders showed no signs Friday that they would hold direct talks to ease a bitter military and diplomatic stand-off as a long-awaited South Asian summit in Nepal was delayed by a day.
Hopes also dimmed for informal dialogue between the nuclear powers' leaders, as the delay prompted the cancellation of a retreat where they could have talked away from the media spotlight.
The postponement of the summit until Saturday was forced by the late arrival of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, whose flight from China was delayed by several hours due to bad weather.
Musharraf, who had flown via China because of an Indian ban on Pakistani planes in its airspace, hinted on his arrival in Kathmandu that he was ready for talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
""If there is willingness on both sides there can be talks; it can't be a one-sided affair,"" said Musharraf, attending his first summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) since seizing power in a 1999 coup.
""I am meeting all the leaders of the SAARC countries, but a meeting with the Indian prime minister is not sure,"" he told reporters.
With Vajpayee ruling out formal face-to-face talks with Musharraf, the key opportunity for a private meeting would have been a retreat near Mount Everest on Saturday night -- an event cancelled because of Musharraf's late arrival.
Indian officials said Vajpayee would return home as scheduled Sunday to hold talks in New Delhi with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is on a peace mission to the region.
The seven SAARC leaders Friday evening attended a banquet hosted by Nepal's King Gyanendra, where Musharraf and Vajpayee were not seated next to each other, spokesmen said.
But Pakistani spokesman Rashid Qureshi told reporters ""the concept of a retreat has not been changed"" and that a new venue may be chosen for the event.
Indian spokeswoman also hinted a retreat was still possible, saying it ""will depend on practical considerations of time.""
But she said there was no ""conducive climate"" for direct talks between India and Pakistan in Kathmandu.
""It is not as if the door has been shut with Pakistan for a dialogue, but under the present circumstances when the seat of a democracy was attacked a certain threshold was crossed,"" she said, referring to a December 13 attack on India's parliament, which New Delhi has blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
The attack led to relations between the perennial rivals sinking to a 30-year low, with the nuclear powers massing troops on their border and exchanging gunfire in Kashmir, the focal point of their half-century rivalry.
With some Indian hawks calling for tougher action against Islamabad, Pakistani officials at the summit released a statement saying China had assured Musharraf of its ""principled and everlasting support"" for Pakistan faced with the ""the potentially volatile situation that has arisen due to the assembling of Indian forces close to the Pakistani border.""
Qureshi, the Pakistani spokesman, said ""maybe their (the Indians') whole army"" is on the border, which he said gave India ""dangerous capabilities.""
""We feel the Indian government must pull back so that whatever needs to be done is done peacefully through dialogue,"" he said.
Vajpayee and Musharraf last met in July in the Indian city of Agra, where they failed to reach any agreement, with the two sides deadlocked over Kashmir, which is divided between the India and Pakistan and claimed by both.
In a sign of a slight easing of tensions, the two countries' foreign ministers shook hands at the start of the two-day meeting of SAARC's top diplomats on Wednesday.
But India's Jaswant Singh said Thursday that Pakistan had made no formal request for talks with him on the margins of the summit.
Musharraf responded Friday that Pakistan had not formally asked for talks with India and that no such request was necessary.
The summit of SAARC -- which represents one-fifth of the world's population and its poorest region -- will be the first since 1998 after being repeatedly delayed by bickering between India and Pakistan.
The summit is also being attended by the leaders of the five other members -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
Other issues on the SAARC agenda include ways to boost trade, curb the sexual exploitation of women and children and eradicate rampant poverty.

At least four anti-government guerrillas were killed on the spot in Banke district and another three were killed in Dang district, all located in the west part of Nepal, while four others were killed in some other districts of the country when they exchanged fires with the government security forces on Tuesday night, the press release said.

Jeff Lamoureux, 36, and David Morton, 31, both from Seattle, Wash., said in an interview Monday in Katmandu that two men shot at them on Sept. 20 while they were looking for a new route to climb 23,984-foot Mount Nagpai Gosum.
They were more than seven miles inside Nepalese territory at the time, they said.
""We could not believe we were being shot at. There were at least five shots fired at us,"" Lamoureux said.
Lamoureux said at least one gunman was wearing a Chinese army uniform.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing said it had no information on the case but would investigate.
No similar incidents have been reported in the past and the motive remained unclear.
The climbers said they were walking a trail used by traders and refugees to sneak in and out of Tibet when they met a Chinese man who seemed nervous.
""He motioned us to give food and we gave him something to eat and drink. He unzipped his jacket to show us his army uniform and he was carrying an automatic rifle,"" Morton said.
After the man left, they saw another man not far behind, hiding behind rocks and decided that they should return to a nearby village. There they met the same Chinese man, who used motions and broken English to thank them for the food.
The Americans left the village, heading toward the base camp, when they realized they were being shot at by two men, including the Chinese man they had helped.
""We probably ran and hid behind the boulders for four hours before we reached our base camp,"" Morton said. ""We waited until it was 7:30 p.m. and then headed directly to the nearest village.""
The altitude made it difficult to run, Lamoureux said. ""I could taste blood in the back of my throat while I was running,"" he said, describing a condition that occurs at high altitudes, where there is less oxygen.
After three days, they reached Namche, a town at the foot of Mount Everest, notified police and went back with a police escort to collect their gear, backpacks and money they left behind when they fled.
Morton said when they returned with the police, a group of Tibetan refugees and Yak traders confirmed the presence of Chinese soldiers and said they had heard the shooting.

"540",2002214,"Title: Nepal 's crown princess gives birth to boy.rtf; Date: NA; Text: A healthy prince was born Tuesday to Nepal's crown prince, making the newborn next-in-line to the throne of the Himalayan kingdom after his father.
Soldiers of the Royal Nepalese Army gave a traditional 21-gun salute after the birth, the first royal celebration after a palace massacre and a year of mourning.
""The prince was born at the royal palace at 12:49 p.m.,"" the press secretariat of the Narayanhiti Palace said in a statement. The baby weighed 7.3 pounds, the statement said. The mother and child were in stable condition.
The baby was born to Crown Prince Paras and Princess Himani. He is heir to the throne of this Hindu kingdom, a constitutional monarchy where many people still believe their kings are reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu.
The baby has a 3-year-old sister. According to Nepalese law, the eldest son of the king and queen inherits the throne.
Paras' father, King Gyanendra, was crowned monarch of Nepal last year after his brother King Birendra was killed in a royal palace shootout by his son, the then-Crown Prince Dipendra.
Government investigators said Dipendra, drunk and drugged, gunned down his parents and seven members of the royal family at a royal dinner on June 1, 2001. Dipendra later succumbed to gunshot wounds.
For a year, the royal family was in mourning and avoided celebrations.

At least four anti-government guerrillas were gunned down on the spot Sunday in Banke district, while four others were killed in Lamjung district and another two were killed in other districts on Saturday, all located in western Nepal, the press release said.
The guerrillas were killed when they exchanged fires with the government security force, the press release said, adding that the government security forces also seized some arms, ammunition and explosive materials from the guerrillas during their cordon and search operations in these districts.
More than 1,000 guerrillas and over 300 security personnel have been killed since the government imposed the state of emergency on November 26 last year following the series of attacks by the guerrillas on the government security forces after they broke a four-month-long cease-fire talks with the government on November 23 last year.
The Nepali government initiated peace talks with the guerrillas since August last year in order to find a peaceful solution to the six-year-long guerrillas insurgency that has claimed  more than 4, 000 lives, including policemen, guerrillas members and civilians, since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.
However, the three rounds of talks held were inconclusive as the guerrillas demanded the establishment of a republican state, an interim government and a new constitution, which were rejected by the government.

"542",2002617,"Title: 85 children killed, 1,500 orphaned in Maoist violence in Nepal.rtf; Date: May 2, 2002 Thursday; Text: At least 85 children have been killed and 1,500 orphaned by Maoist-related violence in Nepal during the past six years, a non-governmental organization said Thursday.
""Forty-one children were killed by landmines, 44 were killed in crossfire during clashes with the Maoists, 70 were wounded in armed conflicts while more than 30 were kidnapped,"" Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN) said in its report -- Status of Children's Rights in Nepal 2002.
More than 3,000 children have been become homeless because of the fighting since the rebellion began in 1996.
The report also said young girls had reported being sexually abused by Maoist guerrillas.
""Since the Maoists launched their people's war in February 1996, 83 minor children have been put in jail for helping the terrorist groups,"" the report added.
More than 3,100 people have died since the Maoists launched their struggle to topple the constitutional monarchy. Nearly half the deaths have come since November when the rebels pulled out of peace talks and broke a four-month ceasefire with a series of attacks on police and army posts.
Shortly afterwards the government imposed emergency rule and ordered the army in to fight the guerrillas.
CWIN said children in Nepal were ""denied access to schools even at a young age and many of them are facing grave hardships.""
A study carried out by Nepal's Child Labour Protection Centre (CLPC) stated that there are more than 3,600 reported cases of child abuse in Nepal each year.
While 27,000 children fall victims to seasonal diseases like diarrhoea and tuberculosis, another 40,000 are killed by pneumonia, the CLPC said.

Two soldiers also were killed in Sunday night's attack in Rumjatar, a village 125 miles east of Katmandu, the Nepalese capital, the statement said.
There was no independent confirmation of the ministry's claim. Rebels operating from the jungle hideouts rarely comment on casualties.
More than 5,000 people have died during the six-year insurgency, half of them since King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency in November and ordered the army to join police in fighting the rebels. The state of emergency was lifted in August.

"544",2002401,"Title: Investigation begins into plane crash which killed 18 in Nepal.rtf; Date: August 23, 2002 Friday; Text: An investigation began Friday into a plane crash in Nepal which killed 18 people, including 15 foreign holiday-makers, as preparations were being made to fly the bodies back to their home countries.
The light aircraft crashed Thursday just before it was due to land at the popular trekking destination of Pokhara.
The dead included 13 Germans, a Briton, a United States national and three Nepalese crew members.
The bodies of the foreign nationals were brought to Kathmandu Thursday night and post mortems were being carried out at a hospital in the capital, civil aviation authorities said.
A spokeswoman for the German embassy said that officials were making arrangements to send the bodies home.
""But this may take some time as formal identification has to be carried out,"" she said.
The German tourists had arrived in Nepal on August 12 and were due to return home on Friday, according to their tour company, Shankar Travels.
""They were on a trekking holiday and were on their way back to Pokhara and were then due to fly to Kathmandu and home,"" she said.
It was not clear what caused the crash, but there were monsoon rains and fog over Pokhara, 225 kilometres (140 miles) west of Kathmandu, on Thursday.
But air traffic control sources said a malfunction of the aircraft equipment could also have been to blame.
The German embassy spokeswoman said that a federal official was heading for Nepal from Germany to investigate the crash.
Meanwhile, the government has ordered a seven-member expert committee to determine the cause of the accident and produce a report within 45 days.
A spokesman for the British embassy said they would not be involved in the investigation but would monitor it carefully.
""What happened was terribly tragic. Now we are dealing with the post-mortem and the identification and with any matters relating to the family of the victim,"" he said.
The Canadian-built Twin Otter, belonging to private airliner Shangrila Air, went missing a few minutes before it was due to land at Pokhara airport.
It crashed into a small hillock about five kilometres (three miles) from the town.
The last contact between the plane and air traffic control was at 10:00 am (0415 GMT). Around that time local residents heard a huge bang, a local rescue official told state radio.
The plane was flying from Jomson, a popular trekking destination to Pokhara, a town known for its picturesque lake and as a starting point for treks in the Annapurna mountains.
There are about 10 private airlines in Nepal which started up after the country opened up its aviation sector to the private sector about a decade ago.
Newspapers Friday questioned their safety. The Rising Nepal said there had been seven air crashes in the last eight months which had killed 32 people.
Thursday's crash was the second involving a Twin Otter in a month. On July 17 a plane belonging to the private Skyline Airlines crashed killing all four people on board.
That plane was flying from the far northwestern city of Jumla to Surkhet in the south.
In November last year a Twin Otter loaded with emergency food supplies crashed in remote western Nepal after it was struck by a vulture. The captain of the Yeti Airlines plane survived.
News of the crash will do little to help the tourist industry in Nepal which has been hard hit since a June 2001 massacre of the royal family and a subsequent surge in the Maoist insurgency.
More than 4,300 people have died in Nepal since the Maoists launched their ""people's war in 1996 to topple the constitutional monarchy.

Prachanda, the rebels' elusive leader, renewed his talks offer in an interview posted over the weekend on the rebels' Internet news bulletin Janaawaj.
""We have formed a team that would conduct the peace talks once the environment is conducive,"" said Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
""Our minimum condition is the government withdraw allegations of terrorism against us, stop killing of our supporters, tell us the whereabouts of our supporters who are missing or jailed and clearly state their stand on the peace talks,"" he was quoted as saying.
Both the rebels and the government have repeatedly said they are ready for peace talks, but there has been little progress.
There was no immediate reaction from the government on the rebels' latest offer. However, officials have said that they are approaching human rights activists to broker the talks.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began a violent campaign in 1996 to turn Nepal into a communist state.
The insurgency has killed more than 7,000 people, most of them after the king imposed a state of emergency in November 2001 and ordered the army to join the police in fighting the rebels. The emergency was lifted in August.

"546",2002766,"Title: A noble, global idea ties a Minnesota couple in knots(3).rtf; Date: July 20, 2002, Saturday, BC cycle; Text: Colleagues scoffed, relatives worried and his own analysis showed Orlyn Kringstad that getting into the rug-making business would be risky and difficult.
But his friend Arthur B. Schultz, a wealthy businessman whose philanthropy includes building schools for Sherpas in Nepal, asked him to try.
Two years ago, Kringstad accepted Schultz's challenge - and some of his money - to do something to reduce the number of Nepalese children forced to work weaving Oriental carpets for export around the world.
But he realized it was foolish to compete head-on in an industry of poorly run factories, entrenched distributors and retail stores passed down through generations.
His big idea: Instead of traditional Oriental carpets, he'd ask Scandinavian artists to design his products and aim them at consumers looking for something fresh and contemporary.
The idea instantly appealed to Schultz, a Norwegian who was educated in Minnesota and made a fortune in several U.S. businesses, including golf club manufacturing.
Kringstad worked at the time for Sons of Norway, a Minneapolis-based fraternal and insurance organization for descendants of Norwegian immigrants. But at age 56, he wanted a new career before retirement. His wife Marit, a social worker, joined him, eager to make a dent in a big problem.
Aided by the Internet, air shipping and capital from a handful of investors in Europe and Minnesota, their business, called Nordic Textiles and Furnishings, is globalization in the micro. They juggle middle-of-the-night e-mail and faxes, long trips to Nepal and Norway, tax and accounting procedures of three countries and differences in culture and language.
In one linguistic mishap, they got 200 little balls of wool to show customers what colors of carpet were available, but they were surprised when carpets arrived in shades that weren't quite what they expected. The explanation: the carpets used a different kind of wool than the sample balls.
Along with carpets, the Kringstads import furniture and clothes from Scandinavia and pashmina scarves from Nepal. They sell the merchandise to about 40 retailers across the country and in a small store of their own in this Minneapolis suburb. A 5-foot by 7-foot carpet sells for $1,300.
They made a fast start, bringing carpets to market in March 2001, just seven months after meeting with Lise Skjak Braek, a Norwegian designer who agreed to create their first collection.
She took ideas from wooden jewelry boxes, ancient stone carvings, silver buttons and church tapestries for her designs. Many are simpler than traditional Oriental rugs, but a few are as complex as stained-glass windows.
The former mountain guide who runs the production operation in Nepal - introduced to the Kringstads by Schultz - says workers notice the difference. ""Some of those designs are hard to weave,"" Dorjee Sushil Sherpa said in an e-mail interview. But, he added, workers ""also feel that hard designs are really beautiful.""
A short time after the debut of the carpets, one of the Kringstads' investors pulled out, forcing them to decide whether to close. By then, they were already employing dozens of adults in Nepal and providing daycare for their children.
So the Kringstads dug into their retirement accounts, rewrote their business plan and picked up some other investors. ""We didn't want to abandon our commitment,"" Orlyn Kringstad said.
Then, when the market for hand-woven carpets and other luxury goods collapsed after Sept. 11, dozens of factories closed in Katmandu, including the one contracted by the Kringstads. Dorjee Sushil Sherpa and his wife, Ang Lami, scrambled to find another with enough capacity, delaying shipments for three to four weeks.
Their products won certification from Rugmark, a Washington-based organization that opposes child labor in rug production. The Kringstads aim to build a factory of their own in Nepal next year, along with a daycare center and school they'll make available to children of workers from nearby factories. Rugmark helps coordinate such programs with teachers and other assistance.
Orlyn Kringstad said his reliance on adult labor provides a marketing edge. However, though there's no telling when, that advantage will fade as more manufacturers feel pressured to stop using children and seek Rugmark certification.
""What we need to focus on are strong business concepts of quality control and design,"" Kringstad said. ""Our product has to be better than others to gain acceptance. We're not going to make or break our business on the child labor issue.""
The Kringstads recently added more Scandinavian and also some Native American-style rugs, both designed by Minnesotan Laurie Jacobi, to their line. And they expect to turn their first profit this fall.

South Korean President Kim Dae Jung declared the 14th Asian Games open and Olympic judo champions Kye Sun Hui of North Korea and Ha Hyung Joo of South Korea jointly lit the games' ceremonial flame, brought into the stadium by South Korean World Cup soccer captain Hong Myong Bo.
'Aspiring for the enhancement of peace and harmony in Asia, I hereby declare the 14th Asian Games at Pusan open,' said Kim.
The flame, dubbed the 'Flame of Reunification,' along with torches in 42 other countries, was originally lit on Mt. Halla in South Korea and Mt. Paekdu in North Korea on Sept. 5 and united at Imjingak Pavilion near the border truce village of Panmunjom on Sept. 7.
Kye won her gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games while Ha claimed his gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
It is the second time the regional version of the summer Olympics is being held in South Korea, following the 1986 games in Seoul.
A huge cheer went up throughout the crowd of 40,000 as athletes and officials from North and South Korea entered the stadium, marching together under the unification flag at the rear of the procession of delegations.
South Korean handball player Hwangbo Sung Il and North Korean soccer goalkeeper Ri Chong Hui carried the flag for the joint delegation.
After shunning all previous international sporting events in South Korea such as the 1988 Seoul Olympics and this summer's World Cup, the North decided to compete in the Sept. 29-Oct. 14 competition.
A group of around 200 North Korean supporters, who arrived by boat in Pusan on Friday, were also in the arena waving North Korean flags, normally banned in the South but permitted by authorities at limited locations during the event.
North Korea and South Korea marched together at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics two years ago.
Following the order of the Korean alphabet, Nepal headed the procession into the stadium followed by East Timor, which is competing in an international event for the first time since gaining full independence in May.
A six-part show featuring South Korean soprano Jo Sumi and hundreds of dancers and martial arts experts was performed to celebrate the history of the city.
The event also marks the return of Afghanistan to the international sporting arena with the Afghan delegation being led into the stadium with team official Maria Baraki, a former women's basketball player, bearing the country's new flag.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had withdrawn its recognition of the Afghan Olympic Committee in 1999 because of the Taliban government's policy of prohibiting women from sports.
For Japan, synchronized swimmer Miya Tachibana carried her country's flag into the stadium.
Along with a record number of 9,900 participants, bodybuilding and modern pentathlon have been included in the games for the first time to bring the total number of sports to 38.
After dominating the event over the last 20 years, China is expected to finish well clear at the top of the medal standings and hopes to claim over a third of the record 419 gold medals on offer.
Japan has set out to surpass the hosts and finish behind China in the medal standings and also exceed its previous best showing of 64 gold medals at the Hiroshima games in 1994.
