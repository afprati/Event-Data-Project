"5852",2007832,"Title: Doing business in India gets easier.rtf; Date: February 15, 2007 Thursday 12:41 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Feb 15 -- Doing business became easier in India in 2005-2006, according to a new report titled 'Doing Business in South Asia 2007' released by the World Bank on Tuesday. Of the 12 major Indian cities covered by the report, Hyderabad has the most business-friendly regulations, followed by Bangalore and Jaipur.
  Mumbai came in second-to-last and Kolkata last as these cities impose the most complex and costly business regulations. Bhubaneswar, Chandigargh, Chennai, Lucknow, New Delhi, Patna and Ranchi fall in the middle. Typically, large urban centres such as Mumbai and Kolkata have a high volume of business, so regulatory and administrative bottlenecks there create serious congestion, says the report.
  The study tracks a set of regulatory indicators related to business start-up, operation, trade, payment of taxes and closure by measuring the time and cost associated with various government requirements. It, however, does not track variables such as macroeconomic policy, quality of infrastructure, currency volatility, investor perceptions or crime rates. India, the region's top reformer, implemented reforms to simplify business registration, cross-border trade and payment of taxes as well as to ease access to credit and strengthen investor protection, the report said.
  Although the reforms improved India's ranking over its position last year, it still ranks relatively low at 134 and stands 41 places after China, which is reforming at a faster pace. Singapore is ranked number one worldwide. The top-ranked countries in the region are the Maldives (53) and Pakistan (74), followed by Bangladesh (88), Sri Lanka (89), Nepal (100), India (134), Bhutan (138) and Afghanistan (162).
  ""India has made significant improvements in reducing the amount of red tape entrepreneurs face daily. It now takes, for example, 35 days to register a business in Mumbai compared to 71 days a year ago and 89 days in 2004. But despite clear improvements in five out of 10 'Doing Business' indicators, India can do much better,"" said Caralee McLiesh, one of the authors of the report.
  ""By broadly adopting the best practices in business regulation that already exist within the country, India could jump significantly in the global 'Doing Business' rankings, well ahead of other emerging markets like China,"" she added.
  Different local-level regulatory requirements either enhance or constrain local business activity and cause substantial differences in the ease of doing business among Indian cities, says the report. For example, in Hyderabad it only takes 35 days to register property, compared to New Delhi, where it takes almost four times as long (138 days), or to Kolkata, where it takes almost five times as long (155 days). Within India, it is fastest to import and export goods through the Chennai and Kolkata ports, as opposed to through Mumbai.

 The much talked about conference on the disputed territory of Kashmir has kicked off in the Nepali capital, Kathmandu, on Sunday 12 December .
 The meeting is being participated in by about 50 prominent politicians, former bureaucrats, former army generals and intellectuals from neighbouring India and Pakistan, according to reports.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 12 Dec 04
A two-member delegation of Hurriyat Conference comprising Conference leaders Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Prof Abdul Ghani Butt arrived in Kathmandu Saturday to take part in a conference of Kashmiri leaders from two sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the border line that divides the Indian-administered Kashmir from the Pakistan-administered Kashmir - being organized at the initiation of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization Pugwash, a think-tank on nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 The two-day conference, besides improving communications between the people from the two sides, is expected to discuss proposals, which ultimately would help ""improve conditions"" of life on both sides, reports quoting Pugwash secretary general Paul Cotta said.
 Media has been denied access to the conference, that is under way at the posh Hyatt Regency hotel in the Nepali capital. Despite repeated attempts by Nepalnews, hotel staff refused to give access to organizers of the conference. On Friday, Hyatt Regency even refused to acknowledge that such an important conference was being held in their hotel.
 Meanwhile, Nepali officials have told reporters that they had granted permission to organize the conference ""as the concerned countries did not have any objection to the meeting"".
 Earlier, Nepal had not permitted to convene any meeting on the controversial issue of Kashmir in its territory keeping in mind the sensitivities of the Indian government.

The chief of the Nepal office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ian Martin, said in a statement that members of his team had viewed the bodies of 14 soldiers at Birendra Military Hospital in Kathmandu.
He did not comment on their wounds but said army claims that 40 soldiers had been executed in the fighting Sunday night in remote jungles nar Kalikot in northwestern Nepal ""need to be carefully verified.""
""If confirmed, they would be very serious violations of international law,"" Martin said.
""I therefore urge the Royal Nepal Army to ensure that a full forensic examination of the victims is conducted by qualified, independent experts,"" Martin said.
Rebel leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, denied the army claims the troops had all been executed, saying 52 soldiers had been captured and were being treated well.
They would be freed ""at an appropriate time,"" he said. ""The army's claims that we lined up the 40 soldiers and brutally murdered them after taking them under control is baseless, imaginary and untrue.""
The UN's Martin, who had appealed to the rebels to treat captured soldiers in accordance with international standards, weclomed ""the public assurance that this will be the case and that those captured will be released.""
He also urged both sides to abide by international laws on conflict.
""I am very concerned for the safety of the civilian population in the vicinity of the fighting and, once again, urge both parties to respect international humanitarian law,"" said Martin.
""This requires that every effort is made to protect civilians, as well as persons who are no longer taking part in hostilities.""
Around 75 soldiers remain unaccounted for after the clash, the deadliest incident since King Gyanendra seized power in February to try to crush an insurgency that has left 12,000 dead in nine years.
The Maoists, who have been fighting since 1996 to instal a communist republic in the Himalayan kingdom, have said 26 of their fighters were killed in Sunday's fighting.

 The former Nepalese ambassador to India and former foreign minister, Dr Bhekh Bahadur Thapa, has said the king's official visit to India is aimed at improving relations between Nepal and India, and will not be focused on any particular issue. He said the international norm is that the head of state's visit to a foreign nation is always aimed at improving bilateral relations rather than trying to address any one particular issue. Talking to Gorkhapatra, he also said the policy issues discussed between two heads of states are always forwarded to decision-making government bodies of their respective countries.
Gorkhapatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Dec 04
He said it is also possible that the king's visit to India is aimed at meeting the new Indian leadership following the change in the government in India. Stating that His Majesty the King has in interviews to the India media stated that he would like to be informed of India's views towards the Maoists, Thapa said it is possible that the king will be discussing the Maoist issue with Indian leaders.
 Stating that there is a traditional practice in India not to change its policies with the change in governments, the former Nepalese ambassador to India said Indian policies on economic and hydropower are not expected to change. He also said the 1996 trade agreement between Nepal and India which aims to reduce Nepal's trade deficit with India has been coming under attack from some Indian industrialists and businessmen. He said the clauses in the agreement which when renewed could have more disadvantages for Nepal than advantages.
 Stating that as a result of the agreement, huge Indian investments in Nepal have increased, along with Indian people benefiting from Nepalese production, the former Nepalese ambassador said due to the vested interest of some individuals, there are clauses in the agreement which limit the scope of trade.

Kathmandu, 7 April [Monday]: The Election Commission (EC) on Sunday directed the concerned authority to stop airing the Ghatana Ra Bichar, a political commentary programme being broadcast every evening by the state-owned Radio Nepal.
The move comes after the programme continued broadcasting materials that blatantly breached the election code of conduct despite repeated warning issued by the EC to the concerned officials.
""It should have been stopped much earlier but we did not do so, hoping that it would correct itself,"" an EC official told the Post.
""We took the step to prevent any misuse during the 'silent period' that comes into force midnight 7 April.""
The Radio Nepal is under the Maoist-run ministry.
During the said silent period none of the media or political candidates would be able to propagate any election campaign-related information.
Instead of Ghatana Ra Bichar, the EC has asked the Radio Nepal to air election-related public awareness programmes.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 5 July
Kakadbhitta [town in eastern Nepal]: The Jhapa [district in eastern Nepal] people's government released 3l detainees Monday [3 July] evening [local time] immediately after Maoist chairman Prachanda directed units under him to promptly close down the people's courts and stop the drives for donations which had been continuing even under the changed situation.
For a long time the people's courts had been finding people guilty of theft, armed robbery and hooliganism and had kept them in labour camps. Jhapa district people's governent chief Harka Khadka released the detainees, telling them all ""to change their thinking as improvement cannot take place without a change in thinking"".
Upon being released by the people's government and their people's court at [local village] Durgapur, 28 of them from Jhapa and three from Ilam [another district in eastern Nepal] were taken away in trucks. They had been put to work digging up the roads at Danabari VDC in southern Ilam, one of those released later said.
[Passage omitted: names of those released]
Meanwhile, the Maoists have stated that the district people's government and people's courts that they had set up at Durgapur in Jhapa had been closed down on Monday [3 July] evening. According to Comrade Bishal of the [Maoist-affiliated] All Nepal National Free Students Union (Revolutionary), they have been closed formally pending another decision.
The people's court had been operating in the rural areas for the past three years but with the new situation that has developed following the second popular movement, the district people's government and the people's court had been operating out of the house of Rajendra Pokharel in Durgapur since 19 May. With the press release issued by Maoist chairman Prachanda, more than 500 cases filed at the people's court have been shelved. Said a Maoist leader, ""We will not register any more cases, but we can reconcile cases on a humanitarian basis.""
Although the Maoists have been staying at the house of Rajendra Pokharel for the past month and half, they have not paid anything, it is stated. They have been using the whole lower floor of the two-storey house and 10 to 12 Maoists a day have been using Pokharel's furniture, sheets and other material on a daily basis. Lately they have been bringing rice for their meals, but before that they had also taken food from the Pokharel family, it is stated.

All the programs of the general strike have been withdrawn from Friday ""keeping in mind the request of intellectuals, civil society and friendly organizations,"" The Rising Nepal newspaper quoted Lekhnath Neupane, chairman of the All Nepal National Independent Students' Union (Revolutionary), as saying.
The left student wing affiliated to the anti-government guerrillas in Nepal had called the national strike on Feb. 25-29 in a bid to disturb the student unions' elections across the country beginning from Thursday.
However, the strike has less impact in the capital and other parts of the country compared to such strikes in the past. A large number of taxis, motorcycles as well as government and private vehicles can be seen operated and many shops were open in the Kathmandu Valley.
Despite three bomb blasts in downtown Kathmandu City detonated by the insurgents to terrorize the general public, life went on normally in the second day of the strike.

  The Maoists entered the town of Jehanabad on Sunday night in small groups, cut off power and raided the local prison in what was described one of the biggest ever attacks by the guerrillas.
  Officials said that two National Security Guards (NSG) teams have been sent to Bihar to capture the rebels.
  G.S. Kang, Bihar's Chief Secretary, said that the NSG commandos would be deployed after identifying the problem areas.
  ""They (National Security Guards) work on specific intelligence and are like anti-terror groups who do combing operations. After identifying the problem areas, their service would be utilised for combating them,"" he told reporters.
  He, however, refused to disclose the next destination of the commandos.
  The Maoists killed at least two people and freed about 350 prisoners in their jailbreak on Sunday.
  The rebels, who were estimated to be 700 in number, killed a prison guard and a member of the Ranvir Sena, a private army of the upper caste landlords in a gunbattle with policemen.
  The guerrillas also abducted at least two-dozen Ranvir Sena members from the jail.
  The state government has suspended Sunil Kumar, the Superintendent of Police, Jehanabad in connection with the incident.
  Maoists, who primarily operate in eastern and southern India, say they are fighting for the rights of landless laborers and impoverished peasants. In Bihar, they often clash with the Ranvir Sena. Dozens have been killed over the past decade.
  The attack took place on a day when police had been deployed in other parts of Bihar for elections to the state legislature in a month-long process, which ends this weekend.
  The Maoists had stepped up their attacks in recent months. Last week, about 300 Maoists stormed a training center for auxiliary policemen, killed five cadets in neighboring Jharkhand state.
  The home ministry has estimated that there are around about 9,300 armed Maoist rebels in the country, and say that they have links with Maoist insurgents in Nepal.

Girija Prasad Koirala, former prime minister and president of the Nepali Congress party, was arrested Monday noon while he was coming out of his residence in Maharajgunj, while Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), and Bamdev Gautam, another senior leader of the CPN-UML were also arrested from their residences.
""Koirala, Nepal and other leaders arrested by the police were released this afternoon after taking them in the Armed Police Force headquarters at Halchowk by a few hours,"" said Home Minister Kamal Thapa, who is also the government spokesman.
Meanwhile, the government has withdrawn the prohibitory order imposed within the ring road of Kathmandu from Monday, which has been imposed indefinitely by the government since April 8 to ban political activities in the capital, Thapa told reporters at the Home Ministry.
On Monday, several supporters of the agitating political parties were injured during clashes with the security forces during street demonstrations. Police fired a few shell of tear gas to control the situation.

"1131",20031802,"Title: Hindu monks vow to wipe out practice of human sacrifice.rtf; Date: June 24, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Hundreds of Hindu monks pledged Tuesday to fight ancient barbaric rituals of human sacrifices at temples in India where the grisly practice continues.
""A very miniscule cult still believes that to achieve supernatural magical powers one needs to sacrifice a child at the altar,"" Biswajit Giri, a 45-year-old Hindu mystic, told AFP.
""The practice of human sacrifice … has not died down completely and is being carried out in many select temples secretly.""
Giri is among some 50,000 monks who have assembled at the temple of the Hindu goddess Kamakhya in Guwahati, the capital of the northeastern state of Assam, for the annual Ambubachi Mela, a four-day ritual that began on Sunday.
The Kamakhya temple has long been considered the highest seat of Tantricism, a sort of black magic that has been an integral part of Indias folklore for centuries.
Mystics who gather at the temple claim they can perform wonders -- make a childless couple conceive, find a distressed loner a spouse or cast an evil spell on others.
""We have been working hard to create awareness to stop such grisly human sacrifices and other such heinous occult practices that do not fit into the modern way of life,"" said Birati Baba, a 60-year-old seer who belongs to the secret Aghor cult, whose adherents meditate in graveyards at night.
""We should put an end to all barbaric practices as such incidents defame tantricism.""
Last week, a self-proclaimed mystic with saffron robes and vermillion beads marked on his forehead almost sacrificed his 18-month-old daughter at the Kamakhya temple.
Amritlal Mazumdar was slicing his daughters neck with a razor when her screams of pain alerted devotees who rescued the baby from being sacrificed.
""It seems the man was a lunatic and we managed to save the child from being sacrificed. The man was arrested by police later,"" temple official Tara Nath Sharma said.
""We have deployed special volunteers at the temple to prevent any such bad things from happening,"" he said.
Earlier this year, two children were sacrificed in the northeastern state of Tripura after a devotee had a dream that offering human livs to the deity would lead him to hidden treasures.
Legend has it that human sacrifices -- an integral part of tantricism -- were widespread in Assam and other parts of India although the practice was officially abandoned some 250 years.
""There was a temple called Kasai Kathi (slaughter house) in eastern Assams Sadia area where it was said human sacrifices were performed,"" said Pradeep Sharma, a researcher on tantricism.
""But we have no evidence to prove this as the temple is now razed to the ground after heavy flooding triggered by a killer earthquake that rocked the state in 1950.""
Many of the monks who have assembled here from various parts of India and the neighboring Hindu kingdom of Nepal say human sacrifices continue in many places, although such rituals are steeped in secrecy to avoid public gaze and controversy.
""Human sacrifices are an essential ingredient to appease the goddess and then get her divine blessings,"" said another sage.
""But then nowadays you dont get volunteers for the sacrifice and hence, as something symbolic, devotees perform the ritual using six-foot effigies made of flour.""

The rebels also have kidnapped at least 8,057 people during that period, mainly students and teachers, most of whom have been freed, according to a report by INSEC Nepal, a Katmandu-based rights group.
The insurgents, who say they are inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, typically kidnap villages for a few days to indoctrinate them in their nine-year armed campaign to replace Nepal's monarchy with communist rule.
Government troops also have arrested 106 rebels suspects, INSEC said.
On Sept. 3, the rebels said they would not attack any military or civilian targets for three months in hopes of reviving the peace process, but would continue to defend their positions.
However, the militants have continued to block highways, extort money, and kidnap students and civilians from villages for indoctrination sessions.
Rebel violence has escalated since King Gyanendra seized absolute control of the government in February, a measure he said was necessary to quell the insurgency, which has left some 12,000 dead.

Kapilvastu [district in western Nepal]: Even during the cease-fire period, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has been recruiting youths for its people's liberation army [PLA] in Kapilvastu district. According to villagers, the Maoists at night gather youths in Niglihawa, Tilaurakot, Bhalbad, Motipur and Kopawa villages among others and pressure them into joining the PLA.
A participant of one such gathering informed that the Maoists say that they have to prepare for another war should the peace talks fail this time, so they are making preparations from now. The participant said the youths selected from various villages will be taken to Maoists' military training camp from 15 May. He said the training camp will be located in Kapilvastu.
When asked about the reports of recruitment, commander of ""people's militia"" Aravinda, said his party had just asked the youths to join the militia. The youths, meanwhile, said they could serve in the national army should the peace talks succeed; otherwise they could make a contribution by participating in the last struggle for democracy.

Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Baburam Bhattarai, second-in-command of the rebel group, met in the capital Katmandu to show their desire to hold negotiations.
""We are serious about resolving the conflict through peace talks and that is why we are here,"" Bhattarai said. ""We are not going to run away from the talks.""
Bhattarai came out of hiding last week for the talks. It was his first public appearance since the rebels began fighting in 1996 to end the Himalayan kingdom's constitutional monarchy. He was accompanied by four senior rebel leaders.
""The country has emerged out of a dark tunnel and is seeing the light. Though the talks have been delayed there will be talks and there will be peace,"" Chand said.
The government said last week talks would begin Tuesday, but the rebels claimed their supporters still were being harassed and postponed the meeting. No new date has been set, though both sides say they want the talks to be held immediately.
The rebels also have called for the release of rebel supporters in custody.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, declared a cease-fire with the government in January. They are demanding an interim government and an election of a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution.
The rebels decided to halt attacks and negotiate after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders and canceled a notice to Interpol seeking their arrest.

"4517",20062287,"Title: Nepal parties begin general strike to protest king's rule.rtf; Date: April 6, 2006 Thursday 1:04 PM GMT; Text: Around 500 party leaders, activists, and students have been detained in different parts of Nepal on the first day of a four-day general strike called by Nepalese political parties, the organizers said Thursday.
In the capital Kathmandu, hundreds were arrested as protesters tried to hold rallies in the nooks and crannies of the city to defy the government ban on public gatherings in city's core.
Elsewhere in the kingdom, protesters gathered in about 50 different places in major cities, the organizers said in a press release.
The major political parties launched the general strike Thursday to protest King Gyanendra's direct rule.
Businesses, schools and shops closed, and roads were quiet throughout the country.
The government has vowed to foil the strike, saying the political parties are staging protests merely to help warring Maoist rebels to topple it.
The government deployed extra security forces, citing the likelihood of violence in major cities and has been rounding up protesters.
The seven parties, including the Nepali Congress Party and the Marxist-Leninist Party, say the general strike is a peaceful protest aimed at forcing the Nepalese monarch hand power back to the people.
The king seized executive power in February last year in what he claims was a bid to stem the Himalayan country's decade-old communist insurgency.
The political parties, however, allege he usurped the people's democracy and returned Nepal to the autocracy of the old days, which is unacceptable to the people of the country.
And, they contend, the king has clearly failed to put a halt to the insurgency-triggered violence, a charge underlined by attacks Wednesday night in which five policemen, two civilians, four rebels and a number of soldiers were killed when an army helicopter crashed.
The rebels carried out simultaneous attacks on police posts, army barracks and government buildings in Malangawa and Nawalpur in Sarlahi district, about 100 kilometers south of Kathmandu.
Security forces fired back and killed four insurgents, the military said.
In Malangawa, the rebels broke into the local jail and released 110 prisoners, according to reports from the district.
The reports also said a night-vision government helicopter flown to the area to conduct aerial attacks against the rebels crashed and the bodies of three army soldiers were recovered from the crash site.
The government claimed the chopper crash-landed, but the rebels claimed they downed it.
The top rebel leader said in a statement Thursday afternoon the rebels had scored a ""historic victory"" by downing the army chopper.
Puspakamal Dahal, known as Prachanda, said the guerrillas used ""modern domestic technique"" to blow up the MI-17 helicopter in the air at around 1 a.m. Thursday.
The rebels also claimed ""dozens"" of soldiers were killed in the crash. Local media put the number of dead at 15.
The Maoist rebels fighting a decade-old rebellion have intensified attacks on government positions recently, but the King has repeatedly ignored calls to reach out to the political parties to tackle the insurgency that has caused more than 13,000 deaths since its outbreak in 1996.

"6089",20072826,"Title: Nepali parliament meet fails to break peace process deadlock.rtf; Date: October 11, 2007 Thursday 3:50 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoists and main political parties on Thursday failed to revive their deadlocked peace process, with a special parliamentary session ending after scant debate on the crisis, officials said.
The former rebels called the meeting to push their demands for a total overhaul of the electoral system as well as the immediate abolition of the Himalayan country's monarchy.
Nepal's biggest mainstream party, however, said it would continue to block the demands, arguing that the Maoists were straying from the terms of a landmark peace deal they signed 11 months ago to end a decade of civil war.
""Our two demands still stand. We hope this session will establish a new consensus among the parties,"" Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said, before the interim parliament adjourned for a long weekend with no progress made.
The three-hour meeting was instead dominated by debate about a Nepali journalist allegedly abducted by the former rebels, who continue to be accused of using violence and intimidation.
The session was also marked by another pro-Maoist protest, with around 5,000 flag-waving supporters marching and chanting anti-monarchy slogans near parliament.
Nepal's largest party, the Nepali Congress, said there was little chance of them agreeing to the Maoist demands -- meaning that the peace process is likely to remain totally deadlocked.
""The Nepali Congress party has decided to vote against the Maoists' motions as their demands do not comply with the interim constitution and the peace accord,"" said senior Nepali Congress leader Arjun Narsingh K.C.
The party supports getting rid of the unpopular King Gyanendra -- who only took the throne after most of the royals died in a palace massacre in 2001 -- but the party wants the issue to be decided by a popular vote.
The UN's top official in Nepal on Wednesday pointed to a failure of both the Maoists and the country's mainstream parties to implement agreements on key issues.
Weaknesses include the Maoists' continued ""mafia-like"" conduct, and the government failing to assist former rebels currently restricted to UN-supervised camps.
As part of the accord, the UN was invited to monitor former guerrillas confined to camps around the country, and assist in polls on the country's political future that have twice been cancelled.
The parliament session will resume early next week for a vote.
Despite storming out of an interim government last month, the Maoists still have 73 lawmakers in the 330-seat parliament. The Nepali Congress has 132 seats.

"6967",20083880,"Title: Exile Tibet radio claims China steps up jamming of news broadcasts.rtf; Date: April 2, 2008 Wednesday 1:14 PM GMT; Text: The exile radio network Voice of Tibet on Wednesday accused Beijing of stepping up jamming of its shortwave news broadcasts into the Himalayan province during a crackdown on anti-Chinese demonstrations in Tibet and ahead of the 2008 Olympics in China.
""There has been enormous focus on journalists not getting free access to Tibet. The other side of the coin is that information from the outside is not getting into Tibet,"" said Oystein Alme, a Norwegian who runs the nonprofit foundation's business office in Oslo.
Most of the Voice of Tibet's 13 staff work at its main editorial office in Dharamsala, India, with Alme handling administration and funding in Oslo. The network started broadcasting in 1996, and has daily evening newscasts about Tibet in the Tibetan language and Mandarin Chinese.
""They started jamming us nearly 13 years ago,"" Alme told The Associated Press. ""Now they have been stepping it up in connection with the demonstrations.""
Tibetans have been protesting and rioting in the longest challenge to China's rule in the Himalayan region since 1989. The crackdown by Chinese authorities has focused international attention on the country's human-rights record in the run-up to the Beijing Games in August.
The protests started out peacefully among monks on March 10 the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule but they turned violent four days later. The province has been all but closed to independent news media. Chinese officials say 22 people have died in the protests, while Tibetan exiles say nearly 140 people were killed.
Alme said the Chinese use ground stations in Tibet to transmit two or more additional signals on the frequency used by the Voice of Tibet to make the broadcasts incomprehensible.
""The Chinese jamming transmissions contain a mixture of dragon dance music, drums and noise, and affects listening also in India, Nepal and Europe,"" said Alme. The Chinese are ""denying Tibetans access to uncensored news and information from the outside world.""
Alme said Chinese jamming violated international treaties giving the network exclusive rights to its registered frequency.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing had no immediate comment on the allegation.
China's Communist government maintains strict controls over the media. Domestic news outlets are entirely state-run and Beijing limits access to foreign news broadcasts and Web sites.
International organizations, including Reporters Without Borders and the World Association of Newspapers, also have protested China's crackdown on information to and from Tibet, particularly considering its promised of press freedoms when it was awarded the 2008 Olympics.
""The Chinese government is trampling on the promises it made linked to the Olympics and preparing the ground to crack down on the Tibetan revolt in the absence of witnesses,"" said a recent statement from Reporters Without Borders, which also protested Chinese jamming of the Voice of Tibet, the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.
During pro-democracy protests in Myanmar late last year, the Oslo-based Democratic Voice of Burma was a crucial source of information about what was happening in that country after the military dictatorship cut off most information during a brutal crackdown. The independent Burma radio managed to smuggle out pictures and information through the Internet and by mobile phones.
""It is very different for us,"" said Alme about Tibet. ""We don't have any information. The grip on the Tibet is much stronger.""
Alme refused to say where Voice of Tibet transmitters are based or who funds it, fearing Chinese efforts to force them to withdraw support.

 Text of press release by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on 10 June; subheading as published.
 Several Nepalese journalists were injured, at least one seriously, as police clashed with reporters and photographers demonstrating against government media restrictions and detentions in protests across the country yesterday, according to local news reports.
 Guru Prasad Gautum, secretary of a local chapter of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, remained hospitalized today after police beat him severely in the stomach during a protest yesterday in Kailaya, a town in the Bara district, south of the Kathmandu Valley, according to news reports. At least eight other journalists were injured when police baton-charged the rally, which was organized to protest this week's detention of more than 50 journalists in the capital, Kathmandu, according to local news reports.
Committee to Protect Journalists press release, New York, in English 10 Jun 05
In the town of Butwal in western Nepal, police yesterday briefly detained another nine journalists, including FNJ [Federation of Nepalese Journalists] Rupandehi district secretary Deepak Gyawali, who were also protesting the detention of their colleagues in Kathmandu, according to Committee to Protect Journalists [CPJ] sources. Six journalists were hurt when police used their batons to round up protesters, journalist Dilip Bhattarai told CPJ from Butwal.
 The journalists in Kathmandu were released from police custody yesterday. They had been detained while protesting the government's proposals to codify emergency press restrictions by amending the media law.
 Demonstrations continued today in the capital, as radio journalists protested a ban on broadcasting FM news radio by reading news reports over loudspeakers in the street. Police did not interfere with that demonstration.
 Also yesterday, the Ministry of Information and Communication responded to a Supreme Court order that the government explain its ban on private FM news broadcasting, according to local news reports. The ministry explained that its ban did not cover all FM broadcasting, but only ""specific news programs."" Hundreds of radio journalists are out of work following a February ban on the private broadcasting of political news.
 The government is asking the court to dismiss a complaint filed by journalist Binod Dhungel challenging the FM news ban. The court did not take immediate action on the government's request.
 Abducted journalist released
 In a separate development, Maoist rebels released Kantipur daily reporter Bikram Giri, who was abducted last week in the far western Darchula district, Kantipur news editor Gunaraj Luitel told the Committee to Protect Journalists. Rebels abducted the reporter 3 June while he was traveling near the village of Changru, according to the online version of Kantipur. The journalist's release followed appeals to the Maoists by the FNJ. It is unclear why Giri was abducted.
 Som Sharma, a reporter for the weekly newspaper Aankha, remains missing and is suspected to be in Maoist custody after he was abducted from his home in the eastern district of Ilam nearly a month ago, according to Nepalnews.com.
 ""Journalists in Nepal face great risks from both Maoist rebels and the government as they fight to practise their profession,"" CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper said. ""We call on both sides to respect the rights of journalists to report the news.""

    Cessation of armed hostilities would be the first step in a  peace process.

    The Finnish diplomat urged both the government and guerrillas  to work sincerely toward a properly monitored cease-fire agreement, followed by a well-structured peace process. 
    ""We are gravely concerned that unless all involved move quickly to address the country's problems effectively, there is a strong  risk of political collapse in Nepal,"" Mustonen said.
    Citing EU's policy toward Nepal, which aims at ""de-escalation  of violence, transition to multi-party democracy and an inclusive  and comprehensive peace process,"" he further said that the  continuing inability of stakeholders -- the king, political  parties and guerrillas -- to enter into constructive dialog toward peace has wide-ranging repercussions on Nepal's standing in the  international community.

Deuba was met at the airport by India's junior foreign minister E. Ahmed.
The Nepalese premier's five-day official visit comes amid increased violence in Nepal as Maoist rebels step up their efforts to overthrow the monarchy and impose communist rule.
As part of their campaign the Maoists have vowed to force the closure of 35 companies, including some Indian-run firms, by Friday on top of 12 they shut last month.
Deuba is due to meet his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Defence Minister P. Mukharji and other leaders.
India, which supplies weapons, military equipment and training to Nepal's ill-equipped security forces, shares a porous nearly 1,600-kilometer- (990-mile) long border with the Himalayan kingdom.
The Maoists, who already control vast areas of countryside, last month staged a week-long blockade of Kathmandu that they enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.

"7116",20083812,"Title: Nepal set to abolish monarchy, become republic.rtf; Date: May 28, 2008 Wednesday 2:16 AM GMT; Text: The Himalayan kingdom of Nepal was set for historic change Wednesday with an assembly expected to abolish the country's 240-year-old monarchy, in a key victory for former Maoist rebels.
Security was tight around the venue for the assembly, which is set to dissolve the monarchy and sack the unpopular King Gyanendra when it holds its first session later Wednesday.
Scores of police ringed the conference centre in Kathmandu after a series of bomb blasts in the runup to the meet by suspected ""anti-republicans"" supporting Gyanendra, who ascended the throne seven years ago after a palace massacre.
A homemade bomb exploded in a Kathmandu park on Tuesday shortly after Constituent Assembly members were sworn in, injuring two people.
The lawmakers, elected in last month's polls to draft a new constitution, were set to begin proceedings at 11:00 am (0545 GMT) at the convention centre.
""This is an epoch-making day,"" Maoist leader Prachanda, who is expected to head the country's next government, told reporters on Tuesday.
""For the past 50 years people have been fighting for this. The institution of the monarchy will formally come to an end.""
The Maoists, who have long vowed to remove the king and create a republic, emerged as surprise winners in the April polls, taking a third of the assembly's 601 seats.
The Maoists signed a landmark peace deal in 2006 that brought them into the political mainstream, ending a decade-long insurgency that killed thousands of people and crippled the already impoverished nation's economy.
Gyanendra was crowned following the 2001 killing of his popular brother Birendra and most of the royal family by a drink-and-drug-fuelled crown prince who later killed himself.
Although seen by loyalists as the reincarnation of a Hindu god, he remained at the centre of conspiracy theories linking him to the killings.
He still enjoys some support from Hindu hardliners and powerful elements in the armed forces and ruling elite, but observers of the royal house said Wednesday's meet appeared to be the end of the Shah dynasty.
""He has been isolated and he has a very slim chance of making a comeback,"" said Surendra Khatri Chhetri, a history professor at Tribhuvan University.
""The strength of republican sentiment has cornered the king.""
Kishore Shrestha, editor of a weekly newspaper that regularly runs scoops from palace staff on the dynnasty said the king appeared to be preparing for life as a commoner.
""Palace sources have told me he has started laying off large numbers of staff, and has been renovating two of his private properties,"" Shrestha said.
""My sources tell me that he will vacate the main palace very soon.""
Gyanendra's whereabouts were unknown late Tuesday, after he was seen leaving Narayanhiti palace, a sprawling complex in the heart of Kathmandu, driving himself and Queen Komal in a Mercedes car and part of a small convoy.
The palace press secretariat said it did not know where the king was going, or if he was leaving for good -- in line with Maoist demands that he vacate his royal home and bow out gracefully.
Last month's vote appeared to vindicate the Maoist demand for a republic, with the former rebels winning more than a third of the new assembly's seats.
But less than a day before the assembly was to begin, the mainstream parties and Maoists were still wrangling Tuesday over the make up of a new government.
Maoists insist they have the right to lead the nation after their win, but the other parties fear the former rebels will now have too much power.
Gyanendra sealed his fate in early 2005, when he dismissed the government and took direct control, galvanising public sentiment against him.
The rebel Maoists and political parties launched mass protests that forced the king to back down a year later.
In the process the once bitter foes drew closer together, forging the 2006 peace agreement, ending a decade of civil war that killed 13,000 people, and completely sidelining the king.
""The doors to a republic were opened by the king himself,"" said historian Khatri Chhetri. ""The palace is no more a central figure of politics.""

Excerpt from news report headlined ""Valley tense over protests against 'killing'"" published in Nepalese newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 13 September
Kathmandu: A dozen road vehicles were vandalized in the capital Friday [12 September] in the course of a valley shutdown called by the Nepali Congress party's fraternal organization, Nepal Students' Union, and a local action committee, alleging that one of their party workers was killed in police beatings. More than two dozen people were injured in clashes between police and demonstrators. 
Pradeep Khadka died in police beatings in the course of night checking [on the highway] at the Balkumari location near the capital Thursday night [local time]. 
During the shutdown, which was called over allegations that the death was caused by police beating, widespread protests were held in front of various college campuses in the valley. 
The demonstrators made various demands including an investigation into the incident, action against six police personnel involved in the incident, compensation for the family of the dead man, and security guarantees by the state. 
Police had to fire some two dozen tear gas shells at two separate locations to bring the demonstrations under control. Police arrested about four dozen people, but released them in the afternoon. 
[Passage omitted: further details about the incident and its aftermath] 
All private schools and college campuses in the valley remained closed during Friday's valley shutdown.

    In Janakpur, some 125 km southeast of capital Kathmandu in  southern Nepal on Terai plains, demonstrators pelted stones at the ruling SPA's supporters and activists when they were gathering for the rally. The SPA supporters started to retaliate after stones  were pelted at the assembly venue.
    Among the more than 60 injured, many were injured in stampedes  following the clashes between the police and demonstrators and  between demonstrators and SPA supporters. Around 30 injured were  treated at local hospitals. 
    This is the fifth mass meeting the ruling parties organized to  push for the Constituent Assembly slated on April 10.
    Activists of former Nepali Interim Government minister Rajendra Mahato-led Sadbhawana Party (SP) and Terai Madhesh Loktantrik  Party(TMLP) had staged demonstration in Janakpur against the seven parties on Saturday morning, but they quickly dispersed after the  police intervened into it. The SP and TMLP were among the Madhesi  groups imposing bandh (general strike) in Terai to disrupt the  seven-party's election assembly.
    Armed outfits like Jay Krishna Goit-led faction of Janatantrik  Terai Mukti Morcha, or Terai Democratic Liberation Front (JTMM- Goit) backed the bandh.
    The major claim of these Madhesi parties or groups is to  satisfy their demands ahead of the Constituent Assembly elections.
    police had to use force in different parts of the town as  demonstrators attacked people going to the SPA rally venue. More  than 25,000 people have converged on the rally venue.

The man could not explain his presence with the Chinese woman and both were taken into custody, police said.
But they insisted they were a couple and the woman's passport was found to be genuine.
Police released them, but the Indian authorities are keeping a close watch on the woman, police said.
The Dalai Lama will arrive in Bodhgaya later Tuesday for the Tibetan festival Kalchakra Puja which begins on Saturday.
Four Chinese men were arrested for spying when the Dalai Lama visited Bodhgaya last year, officials said.
Huge security cover has been provided to the Nobel Laureate, who will inaugurate the 10-day festival in the Buddhist holy city.
Indian authorities have said they have received death threats against the Dalai Lama from Chinese militant organisations identified as Sugden and Norge, which have links with Nepal's Maoist rebels.
The Dalai Lama is also facing protests from local Buddhists, who accuse him of being anti-Indian and have threatened acts of violence during the visit.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after an abortive uprising in 1959 and established the government-in-exile in India.
China, which has ruled Tibet since 1951, has been accused of trying to wipe out its Buddhist-based culture through political and religious repression and a flood of ethnic Chinese immigration.

"251",20033241,"Title: Powell tours once-flourishing city in Jordan.rtf; Date: June 21, 2003 Saturday; Text: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell did something unusual Saturday: He took a few hours off.
Powell, notorious for not including relaxation time in his frequent trips abroad, flew to this once-flourishing Jordanian city for a guided tour of ruins dating from the 1st century B.C.
One of the few exceptions to Powell's all-business approach to foreign travel was a brief tour last year to a Hindu monastery in Katmandu, Nepal.
Saturday morning, Powell boarded a helicopter in the Dead Sea resort town of South Shuneh and headed south, passing over barren, adobe-hued hills and plains.
On arrival 45 minutes later in Petra, Powell and his traveling party boarded a 10-vehicle caravan for the short drive to the outskirts of the area that two millennia ago was the center of the thriving Nabatean culture.
Wearing a red polo shirt, a souvenir from a Wednesday visit to Bangladesh, Powell walked through a walkway flanked by a tan-and-pink rock formation extending higher than 30 feet (9 meters) up.
His guide was Pierre Bikai, a Lebanese-American archaeologist who is an Amman-based researcher financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Powell viewed the remains of one of several Byzantine churches and made a brief visit inside.
His black shoes sporting a layer of dust, Powell ascended a stone-strewn 100-foot ( 30-meter) hill and gazed at several temples off in the distance.
Aside from tourists, there were few signs of life in the immediate area: an occasional Bedouin could be seen with camels lying placidly in the summer sun.
Petra was the principal city of ancient Nabatea; a devastating earthquake leveled half the city in A.D. 363.
After two hours, Powell's tour was over. He pronounced the site very impressive.
He was back at his Dead Sea hotel and soon was getting ready for a luncheon in Amman hosted by King Abdullah II. Also scheduled was an afternoon meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a dinner in honor of Powell and other delegates attending the World Economic Forum in South Shuneh.

Gold and silver dealers attributed continuous surge in gold prices to international price rally. As Nepal fulfils gold demand through imports, any change in price in international bullion market directly affects prices in the domestic market.
The yellow metal topped $1,900 per troy ounce in the international bullion market during early trading on Tuesday. Gold has been moving into uncharted territory in recent weeks as persistent worries about global economic growth continue to burnish the yellow metal's safe-haven appeal.
The price of gold has already increased by 16 percent within a month. Increased consumption of the yellow metal by India and China following downgrading of US credit rating is the other reason behind rise in gold prices in the international market.
""Investors are putting money on gold due to persisting gloom in global stock market. This has affected gold prices in both international and domestic market,"" Tej Ratna Shakya, president of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealer's Association (Negosida), said.
Gold price has increased by Rs 4,500 per tola in a week's. Business volume too has dropped by 25 percent, according to gold and silver dealers.
""Analysts expect bullion prices to become stable from next weeks as central banks in different countries are making necessary corrections to take the situation under control,"" Shakya said, adding, ""But it is likely that the yellow metal will hit $2,000 per troy ounce in the international market as speculated by some market analysts about a month ago.""
The price of silver too increased to Rs 1,270 per tola in the domestic market on the day.
""Silver is becoming costlier because people who can't afford to invest in gold are putting their money in silver. The price of silver is likely to fall once gold becomes stable,"" added Shakya.

The frigid weather has claimed 1,935 lives in India, Nepal and Bangladesh since mid-December.
People began wearing light clothes in New Delhi as the temperature reached 25.2 degrees Celsius (77.3 degrees Fahrenheit) Monday, 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) above normal, an officer at the weather office said. The day's low was 13.5 C (56 F).
No new deaths were reported in South Asia on Tuesday. The death toll stood at 1,100 in India, 786 in Bangladesh and 49 in Nepal from the bitter cold and icy Himalayan winds that lashed the region, officials said.
The three-week spell was the coldest in 40 years in the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the weather officer said on customary condition of anonymity. In the past, cold spells typically lasted seven to 10 days.
Winters are normally short and mild in South Asia, and the unseasonably long cold weather caught millions of poor people living in flimsy, unheated shelters unprepared. Many spent cold nights making bonfires to keep themselves warm.
Schools and colleges were closed for several days in India. The eastern Indian state of Bihar declared a disaster, enabling it to seek federal help in distributing 2 million blankets and wood to the hundreds of thousands of homeless.
Last week, S.K. Subramanian, deputy director general at the Indian Meteorology Department, attributed the cold spell to atmospheric disturbances over Pakistan and Afghanistan which prevented cloud formations that help raise temperatures by holding in heat.
Dense fog also kept temperatures low and severely disrupted rail, road and air traffic in India and Bangladesh over the past three weeks.
On Tuesday, flight and train schedules were back to normal, state transport officials said.

KATHMANDU, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The third round of peace talks between the Nepali government and the anti-government guerrillas concluded Tuesday evening without any breakthrough as wide gap remained in perceptions of both sides on some key political issues.
The third round of formal talks kicked off on Sunday in Nepalgunj city in western Nepal. Afterwards, four sessions of the negotiations were held separately in the city and the remote village of Hapure in Dang district, some 400 kilometers west of Kathmandu.
The previous two rounds of formal peace talks were held on April 27 and May 9 this year, respectively, in Kathmandu in an attempt to end the seven-year-long insurgency which has claimed over 7,500 lives in the Himalayan kingdom.
At the beginning of this latest round of talks, the two sides agreed to discuss six issues, including political agenda, overall socio-economic reforms, settlement of the armed forces and weapons, rehabilitation of the affected people and reconstruction of the infrastructure destroyed by the guerrillas in the last seven years.
However, when the negotiations started focusing on the political agenda presented by the government and the guerrillas, a great difference appeared between the two sides.
The guerrillas demanded that they would accept nothing less than forming a constituent assembly in order to draft a new constitution for the country, while the government insisted that the current constitutional monarchy and multi-party system should not be changed.
In the first session of negotiation on Sunday, the government put forward its political agenda, which integrates both national issues and the demands of the guerrillas as well as the major political parties in the country. But it was rejected by the coordinator of the guerrillas' talks team Baburam Bhattarai, who said there should be a drastic change in the state system, otherwise the current political crises facing the country would not be solved.
However, both sides agreed to ""adjourn"" the third round of talks, and to hold another round of peace talks in the near future in a bid to avert the breakdown of the peace process.
""There is a need to hold consultations about the political agenda presented by both sides. Therefore, we have decided to hold the fourth round of talks soon,"" said Minister for Information and Communications Kamal Thapa, who is also the spokesman of the government talks team.
On the future of the peace process, Thapa believed, ""The talks will not break down. The government is committed to providing continuity to the talks and is confident that the differences between the two sides will be solved in the next rounds of talks.""
Political observers here believed that the constitutional monarchy and multi-party system is the precondition and cornerstone of the peace talks between the government and the anti- government guerrillas.
The government led by the then Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand initiated the peace process after the guerrillas yielded from their original position of establishing a republic in the country and abided by the constitutional monarchy system. If they break off from this compromise, the peace process will be deprived of its foundation, the observers said.

Thousands of children offered their prayers at the Swayambhunath Stupa, a towering temple with etching on all sides of the eye of the Buddha said to watch over the Kathmandu Valley.
King Gyanendra and Queen Komal, who are Hindus, paid their respects at Swayambhunath where thousands of people dressed in their finest clothes joined Buddhist monks and nuns in a procession through the temple.
The Buddha was born in 544 BC in Lumbini, 460 kilometres (285 miles) south of Kathmandu, where monks held their own prayers Tuesday.
The birth anniversary, known as Purnima and observed on the fifth full moon of the year, is a national holiday in Nepal even though Buddhists are a minority. The sale of meat is banned across the country for the day.
More than 9,500 people have died in insurgency in Nepal since 1996 as Maoist rebels battle to overthrow the monarchy.

Key facts:
GEOGRAPHY: At 147,181 square kilometres (56,826 square miles), Nepal is slightly larger than the US state of New York, and half the size of Italy. It borders the Chinese autonomous region of Tibet, with which it shares the world's highest peak, Mount Everest.
POPULATION: 28.3 million. (World Bank, 2007).
CAPITAL: Kathmandu (pop 1.5 million).
LANGUAGE: Nepali. English is widely used in government and business.
RELIGION: Hindus account for nearly 90 percent of the population, and there are small Buddhist and Muslim communities.
RECENT HISTORY: Nepal became a British protectorate in 1816, and won independence in 1923.
The hereditary monarch, seen by many Nepalese as a living god, set up a system of modern cabinet rule in 1951. Multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy came in 1990, after a popular uprising that left hundreds of people dead.
Maoists launched an insurgency to bring down the monarchy in 1996 after boycotting elections and denouncing widespread corruption.
The present king, Gyanendra, came to the throne in June 2001, after a palace massacre in which the then-crown prince killed most of the royal family and himself died.
King Gyanendra faced huge opposition after firing the government and seizing direct control in February 2005 on the grounds that the parties had failed to end the war with the Maoists.
Direct rule lasted 14 months until he was forced to reinstate parliament following weeks of violent pro-democracy protests, during which crowds burnt effigies of him and called him a ""murderer.""
A peace deal signed in November 2006 brought in an interim constitution, and brought Maoists into the parliament.
The agreement called for elections to a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution and review the role of the monarchy. The vote, already delayed twice, is to take place on Thursday.
ECONOMY: Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. About three quarters of its citizens work in farming, which accounts for 38 percent of GDP.
Industrial activity is mainly processing farm products such as jute, sugarcane, tobacco and grain.
Per capita GDP: 331 dollars (World Bank, 2007).
Foreign debt: 5.3 billion dollars (2005).

"5890",20071550,"Title: Puerto Rico Lays Traps for Monkeys.rtf; Date: June 13, 2007 Wednesday 8:17 PM GMT; Text: Authorities in Puerto Rico are using cages and mangos to try to trap hundreds of marauding monkeys descendants of escaped research animals and hope to send them off to sanctuaries or labs, or to kill them.
Since the first eight traps were set out two weeks ago, the primates have snatched the bait and eluded capture in traps set by Puerto Rico's natural resources agency drawing ridicule from local farmers who blame the monkeys for devastating melon, pepper and pumpkin crops over the last decade.
But Javier Velez Arocho, secretary of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, said Wednesday that's part of the plan that animal control workers have not yet activated the mechanism that will trap the animals.
""We want to lure them for now,"" Arocho told The Associated Press, saying that he hopes to attract monkeys first and then capture a large group.
""The farmers say it's easy to capture monkeys,"" he said. ""If it's as easy as they say, why hasn't this problem been eradicated?""
On Tuesday, farmers in the Lajas Valley displayed two monkeys they said they had captured in about 25 minutes. Rangers came later and two the two primates away.
The Rhesus monkeys, native to Pakistan India and Nepal, and lightning-quick red monkeys from Central Africa were brought to this Caribbean island 30 years ago to be part of scientific experiments.
Their feral population has since ballooned from about 100 to an estimated 1,000 prompting growers in the southwestern town of Lajas to switch to raising hay, which the animals do not eat, said Georgie Ferrer, leader of the local farmers' organization.
Ferrer also said the animals threaten bird populations by eating eggs, and some carry the Herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans. Fears that they could transmit the disease intensified after a farmer bitten two years ago in Lajas died of unknown causes, he said.
The government has earmarked $450,000 to capture the animals and plans to introduce 12 more cages.
Desperate farmers are offering to help.
""It's not that the government's plan isn't going to work, but they have to know the dynamics,"" Ferrer said. ""If you don't know the monkeys' customs, their favorite food or the time at which they drink water, it's going to be real hard to capture them.""
Velez said as many of the captured animals as possible will be sent to sanctuaries or research centers, but the government has not completed such arrangements. The rest will be euthanized.
Kelly Overton, director of the New Orleans-based nonprofit People Protecting Animals & Their Habitats, said neither option is a good one for the monkeys.
""When animals are released into the wild, we end up in a situation like this,"" he said. ""Now it's too late. There's not going to be a happy ending to this story.""

 The seven-party opposition alliance has renewed its appeal to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to create an environment of trust before they could sit for negotiations.
 A meeting of top leaders of seven opposition parties met at the Nepali Congress central office this morning to discuss, among others, [the] week-old Maoist proposal to appoint an authorized ""negotiating team"" to hold dialogue with his party on ""all political agendas"".
 Talking to reporters after this morning's meeting, a senior CPN (UML) leader Jhalnath Khanal said, the Maoists needed to do a lot to create an environment of trust between them and the parliamentary parties.
Nepalnews.com website, Kathmandu, in English 18 Jul 05
""There exists 'Pacific Ocean of distrust' between us. The Maoists need to walk several miles (before that gulf is filled),"" said Khanal. He also added that there was a need to re-establish political relations between the mainstream parties and the insurgents.
 On last Monday, Prachanda called upon the opposition parties to come forward by constituting an official negotiation team' in order to create what he called a massive people pressure for a democratic way out. ""A strong basis of confidence could be prepared by holding dialogue with such a negotiation team by organizing serious discussions on the whole gamut of political issues,"" he added.
 The Maoist chairman recalled that the directives issued by his party to all its cadres not to target activists of the seven-party alliance was being enforced strictly, except some ""accidents"".
 But opposition parties have maintained that Maoist guerillas continue to harass, intimidate and even kill their workers and supporters in the rural areas. Hundreds of workers mainly affiliated to Nepali Congress and CPN (UML) have been killed, physically wounded or forced to flee their villages thanks to Maoist atrocities.
 The meeting of seven opposition parties on Monday also criticized the budget estimates for the year 2005-06 presented by Foreign Minister Madhukar Shumsher Rana on Saturday terming it as ""unconstitutional"".

"7204",20081574,"Title: INDIA 'S FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.rtf; Date: July 25, 2008 Friday 9:51 AM  EST; Text: Guwahati July 25 -- India's fight against terrorism is no longer confined to its borders. The terrorist bombing of its embassy in Kabul does not appear to be a one-time terrorist assault on Indian facilities and interests abroad. It may very well be the beginning of a new trend that requires careful planning and execution on the part of New Delhi to prevent future occurrences.
Although India has been fighting terrorism largely within its borders for decades, neighbouring countries, particularly Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh have often been used by anti-India terrorists as safe havens or bases for training and launching operations. But except loud complaints against cross-border terrorism, sometimes sponsored by Islamabad and at other times silently encouraged, New Delhi has not been able to do much. The long peace process with long Pakistan has certainly brought considerable benefits to India in tackling terrorist infiltration into Kashmir. But terrorist activities in other parts of the country have clear footprints of Pakistani connection.
New Delhi has also not been able to put in place any strong bilateral mechanism with Nepal or Bangladesh either to credibly tackle terror. One of the major problems it faces viz these two countries is the absence of a durable governing system. Besides, neither Nepal nor Bangladesh seems to have developed a similar security outlook with India, for participating in cooperative ventures to combat terrorism.
Significantly, Indian facilities or interests in Nepal, Bangladesh or even in Pakistan are not known to have been the target of terrorist groups. Despite dispatch of the Indian Peace Keeping Force to Sri Lanka and its engagement in battles with the LTTE, Indian facilities there have not been targeted so far. The recent attack in Kabul, in which India lost four personnel is thus a new development. It shows signs of a dangerous trend and how New Delhi handles it, will set an example for potential terrorists elsewhere.
Importantly, India has invested a huge amount of capital, human resource and diplomatic stake in Afghanistan, unlike in Nepal and Sri Lanka. When the Maoists launched a long low-intensity war in Nepal, India's role was pretty much limited. Except a brief period of IPKF deployment, India's role in taming LTTE terror has also been rather limited. Thus, the Afghan case stands out.
India has invested several hundred millions of dollars in Afghanistan. Indian engineers, technicians and skilled labour are busy rebuilding the war-torn infrastructure. Unlike in India's neighbourhood, the Afghan Government led by Karzai is in the friendliest of terms with New Delhi, which has not deployed any troops there and is currently engaged only in reconstruction and State-building. Why was then there a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy?
It is important to note that many more local Afghans died in the attack than the Indians. Who were these people? They were either employees in the Embassy or visa seekers. Who did the suicide bomber target then? Those locals, who were apparently friends of India or the Embassy building viewed as a high-value target? Was it an expression of opposition to Indian participation in Afghan reconstruction? Was it a signal of Pakistan's unhappiness over the spread of Indian influence in Afghanistan?
It is unlikely that Afghans of any sect would be opposed to reconstruction activities in their Country. But Afghan resistance groups, primarily the Taliban and their backer, the al Qaeda, are not only hostile to the presence of foreign troops on their soil, but also have opposed reconstruction efforts of the United Nations, other international agencies and individual countries, such as India.
Several reports point out that the number of attacks on civilian construction workers and international aid agencies has been mounting in Afghanistan. The Taliban and their supporters perhaps are afraid that successful reconstruction in the country would turn the people against them and they would lose the steam to carry their mission forward.
New Delhi's allegation that Pakistan's ISI has had a hand in this attack appears to be logically convincing. During the Soviet occupation, the ISI was CIA's pet organisation in training and equipping the anti-Soviet Mujaheedin forces in Afghanistan. Now, it is a target under surveillance. Secondly, the reverses faced by the US-led coalition forces in Iraq, NATO forces in Afghanistan, Iranian ability to withstand the US pressure on nuclear issue and the inability of Islamabad to tackle the law and order situation in the States bordering Afghanistan have not only emboldened the Taliban but also the ISI.
The US, the Musharraf regime and the Karzai Government have all failed to check the growth of Taliban influence in Afghanistan as well as Pakistan. The political uncertainty in Islamabad since the parliamentary election and the institution of a civilian government has, moreover, provided a fertile soil for the dreaded I"

US Ambassador to Nepal James F. Moriarty has said that management of arms in Nepal is the most important matter for the US. ""He (Moriarty) said that management of arms in Nepal is the most important matter for the US,"" Speaker Subash Chandra Nemwang told reporters following the meeting with Moriarty on Tuesday [13 December].
The duo discussed about the formation of interim legislature and management of arms among others. According to Nemwang, the envoy also asked him when the interim constitution will be finalised.
""The US has taken developments taking place in the peace process positively,"" Nemwang quoted the envoy as saying.
Moriarty is departing for Washington on leave on 20 December.
US Assistant Secretary for State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Richard Boucher, during his visit to Nepal last month, had stated that his country would seek a legal way out for continuing to assist Nepal even after the Maoists join an interim government.
The US has been saying that it would not support Maoist led ministries in the interim government till they (Maoists) completely renounce violence.

Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 11 November
Nepalgunj [mid-west Nepal], 10 November: People evicted from their homes by the Maoists who have been leading difficult lives for years, have sought the help of the administration to help them return home safely.
The displaced people of the mid-western hill districts have been staging sit-ins outside the Banke district administration office demanding rehabilitation to their homes. These people have been living in a camp at Rajhena village in Banke district. Angry that they are not able to return home, they have been staging protests for the past week. Highway obstruction is one of the modes of the protests.
""We want nothing else. We just want to go home,"" said Hira Tamata, chief of the displaced people's rehabilitation committee at Rajhena camp. Along with him, 21 displaced people have been staging sit-in outside the office of the district administration for the past four days.
The displaced people announced the launching of their protest action at a press conference on 2 November. On 5 November, they held a rally and obstructed the Mahendra Highway between Kiran Nala and Kohalpur for three hours. The next day, their rally went round the town of Nepalgunj and surrounded the administration office.
""Our voice is not heard when we demanded to return home. Who wants to live like this?,"" Tamata said. Most of the displaced people have not returned home for the past five years. Many of them fear Maoist atrocities once again while others worry about what to eat even if they returned home. In spite of all these fears, they want to return home.
""We are prepared to go through any difficulties if we receive help to return home,"" said Tulasa Shahi who was displaced from Thalaraikar village in Jajarkot district.
The Maoists had destroyed the houses of many of these displaced people. The ones that were not destroyed by the rebels have collapsed in absence of care. There are no household utensils left. The farmlands are barren. ""Until that situation changes, we demand that our accommodation should be taken care of,"" said Hira Tamata.
The displaced people in the camp have started going hungry. In the beginning, some non-governmental organizations helped them with food and shelter at the camp. But for the past few months, such help has stopped coming.
Bhanjan Shahi, a man displaced from Natharpu village of Mugu district, says, ""We are starving to death. Help us return home or make some arrangement for our livelihood."" Eighty displaced families from Mugu, Jajarkot, Dailekh, Humla, Salyan and Jumla districts are living in the camp. Some of them have already returned home at the initiative of the non-governmental organizations.
""We have don not even have expenses to return home,"" says Birendra Singh of Baluwatar village in Dailekh district. We have been away from home for the past four years. We don't know in what state our homes and farmlands are now, he says.
In their 12-point understanding reached last year, the seven political parties and the Maoists had agreed to allow the home return of the conflict-displaced people. Further agreements reached on later dates also talked about the return of the displaced people. But in practice, these people have still not been able to return home.

"7042",20083426,"Title: India pushes for a minimum wage for its 5 million migrant workers in the Gulf.rtf; Date: March 27, 2008 Thursday 1:14 PM GMT; Text: Oil-rich Gulf nations, already facing labor protests, are getting new pressure from India, which wants them to pay minimum wages for unskilled workers.
The move by India which has 5 million workers in the Gulf, making it the largest source of migrants is the strongest push yet by workers' home countries to win better conditions for their citizens. In the past, countries focused on maintaining the flow of billions of dollars workers send home every year, not their welfare.
Indian officials say they hope to sign bilateral agreements with Gulf nations setting minimum wages that would be spelled out in contracts enforced by both India and the host countries, whose economies depend on imported labor.
Gulf nations have so far resisted, fearing higher wages will accelerate already rising inflation. But officials are feeling the heat.
Migrant workers have been holding larger and more violent strikes. Rioting broke out last week in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates during a protest demanding an increase in wages that have declined with the falling dollar.
The vast pool of cheap labor from India, Pakistan and other parts of Asia has been key to the Gulf's monumental boom in recent years. Such workers outnumber native citizens in much of the region.
But labor abuse is frequent. Often, recruiters have workers sign one contract in their home country, then force them to sign a new one at a far lower wage once they arrive in the Gulf.
""The workers are left high and dry by the private agents, who take a lot of money and then not a single promise they make they fulfill when they reach the destination country,"" said Bernard Sami, director of the Arundohaya Migrant Initiative, a group in southern India that works with workers headed to the Gulf.
India runs the risk that companies will simply replace their Indian workers with migrants from poorer countries, which happened to the Philippines when it set minimum wages for its maids in the Gulf.
The Indians in the Gulf, like other foreign laborers, work largely in construction on massive building projects, sending home more than $20 billion every year.
In February, Indian Ambassador to Bahrain Balkrishna Shetty broke new ground when he announced a minimum wage of $265 per month required for all unskilled Indian workers in the country, who currently make from $160 to $225 a month.
Bahraini companies resisted the increase, which was scheduled to begin March 1. That helped spark more than a month of strikes by thousands of Indian workers in Bahrain.
Bahrain's Minister of Labor Majeed al-Alawi said India had no authority to enforce such a measure in the Gulf. The most India can do, he said, is to try to bar its workers from traveling to the Gulf if they don't get a contract with the minimum wage.
""It is in their jurisdiction to do it in their country,"" said al-Alawi. ""All we say is that he (Shetty) cannot apply it in Bahrain or any other Gulf state.""
India scrapped its proposed minimum wage at the beginning of March, according to Shetty. But Bahraini companies reached a deal increasing the salaries to an amount less than $265 a month with improved work conditions, said Salman al-Mahfoudh, deputy head of the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions.
But al-Alawi noted that since then, companies have begun to look to workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.
The Philippines experienced a similar shift away from its workers in the Emirates last year when it instituted a $400 a month minimum wage for maids. Virginia Calvez, the labor attache for the Philippines consulate in Dubai, said demand for Filipino maids dropped by 50 percent.
India brings much more weight to bear than countries like the Philippines and Indonesia because of its size and growing status as an economic superpower.
Surk reported from Dubai and Abbot from Cairo, Egypt. Associated Press writers Reem Khalifa in Bahrain; Scheherezade Faramarzi in Lebanon; Teresa Cerojano in the Philippines; and Zakki Hakim in Indonesia also contributed to this report.

He was speaking at a Reporters' Club function today. He also said that the government needs to move with an open heart to include everyone to find peace in the country as it had already suffered a lot in the nine years of violence and murder.
Radio Nepal, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 18 Jun 04
Nepal said that the UML was in no hurry to be a part of the government and that it was ready to support the government even from outside.

He said that no significant problems had been encountered in the talks so far.

 Kathmandu, 27 October: The nine-day long cessation of hostility for the Hindu festival of Dashain announced by Maoists and reciprocated by the government ends after Thursday midnight 1815 gmt 28 October . The million-dollar question now is - will the warring parties extend the no-offensive period? There are signs that they may, but not everyone is optimistic.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 28 Oct 04
""There is tremendous public desire for extension of the current truce, so it will be morally difficult for either side to resume violence,"" said Padma Ratna Tuladhar, member of the Civil Peace Commission that played a key role in persuading Maoists to announce the cessation. ""Therefore, there is a glimmer of hope that the present situation will continue,"" he added.
 He also revealed that the commission has proposed to both the government and Maoists to suspend hostility at least till the upcoming international Buddhist convention scheduled for 30 November to 2 December in Lumbini, Nepal. Neither side has given any assurance. The apostle of peace, Gautam Buddha, was born in Nepal.
 Talking to the Post Wednesday evening, Minister for Information and Communications Dr Mohammad Mohsin said the government would not go for offensive until Maoists resumed attacks. ""This amply demonstrates government commitment to extend the current situation and to work for peace,"" he added.  passage omitted
 Meanwhile, a Maoist source told the Post that Maoists are yet to decide on the issue. ""The party high command would probably take a decision by tomorrow, "" he said.

Maoist rebels who have blockaded the capital, Katmandu, for a week said they were lifting the blockade, news agencies reported. The reports quoted a faxed statement in which the rebels said they had made the decision after considering requests from businesses, human rights advocates and citizens. 
But they warned that the blockade could be reimposed in a month if their demands for the release of detained Maoists and for inquiries into missing and dead comrades are not met. Before the announcement that the blockade was being lifted, Maoists enforcing it killed at least four soldiers and wounded two after ambushing an army truck on the highway between Katmandu and Tibet. The government again expressed its willingness to talk to the Maoists, but said it would not accept preconditions. The Maoists withdrew from peace talks last August.   Amy Waldman (NYT)

Over 4,000 demonstrators led by the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) marched through Kathmandu denouncing the increases and demanded state subsidies, witnesses and party sources said.
""Cancel the price increment of petroleum products"", ""Down with Chand government"", ""Chand government's gifts are shortages and high prices,"" read placards carried by demonstrators.
The government last week raised fuel prices, blaming increases in the world market due to the war in Iraq.
The price increases saw bus fares go up by 20 percent while taxi fares went up by just over 16 percent.
Demonstrators Wednesday held up traffic in Kathmandu by staging an hour-long sit down in front of the Central Secretariat government offices as anti-riot police squads stood by.

""All 47 industries reopened Thursday,"" Hotel Association-Nepal president Narendra Bajracharya told AFP. 
Among the businesses closed were two luxury hotels.
The All Nepal Trade Union Federation had ordered the closure of the firms from August 17, accusing them of exploiting their workers and threatening dire consequences if they did not shut down.
On Wednesday chief mediator and rights activist Padma Ratna Tuladhar announced the federation had agreed to end the strike and enter talks with Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and government officials over its demands.
These include the disclosure of whereabouts of missing trade union members, compensation to the families of unionists killed in army actions and a wage rise.
The government agreed to free two of five detained Maoist trade union leaders.
Companies hit by the shutdown included energy, food and transport firms. Industry officials said some 25,000 workers were affected.
In August the union federation had ordered 12 of the businesses to close and earlier this month it added 35 more companies to the list.
The rebels last month staged a week-long blockade of Kathmandu that was mainly enforced through intimidation rather than roadblocks.
The Maoists' warnings are often obeyed out of fear of reprisals.
While the rebels allege the companies have unfair labour practices -- charges that are rejected -- they have singled out firms with Western or Indian investment and ones linked to Nepal's royal family.
India, the United States and Britain have been giving financial and military aid to Nepal to crush the Maoist insurgency which began in 1996.
Tuladhar said talks would begin later Thursday on the union's demands.

The crowd, which included journalists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, students and engineers, chanted slogans demanding the royal government withdraw a new set of restrictions on the media.
""Stop authoritarian rule. Restore freedom of the press. We want democracy,"" the protesters chanted.
Meanwhile Sunday, at a South Asian leaders' summit in Bangladesh, Nepal's King Gyanendra assured India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he ""was prepared to take steps to bring about the restoration of multiparty democracy with the active involvement of political parties as early as possible,"" the prime minister's spokesman said.
On Saturday, Gyanendra reiterated to the South Asian leaders his commitment to restore democracy by holding elections before April 2007.
At Sunday's rally in Katmandu, several policemen in riot gear kept watch and escorted the protesters, but did not block them.
The protesters demanded the government withdraw new laws that allow authorities to jail journalists for up to two years for criticizing the royal government. The laws also let officials close newspapers, broadcasters and other media outlets.
In addition, the laws increase the maximum fines for journalists and newspapers that criticize the king's administration by 10 times to 500,000 rupees (US$7,000; [euro]5,800), and empower authorities to revoke journalists' credentials.
The protesters also demanded restoration of other civil liberties, which have been strictly curtailed since the king sacked the Cabinet and formed his own government on Feb. 1.
The monarch said his power grab was necessary because previous governments had failed to curb a growing communist insurgency and clean up corruption.

""My name is Seif Adnan Kanaan. I work at Mosul airport ... My second job is to supply beverages to the US army,"" said the man, who was surrounded by three hooded gunmen, apparently referring to alcoholic drinks.
One of the gunmen read a statement saying that ""the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters) in Mosul were able to capture ... a crusader spy recruited by US forces to spy and inform on the mujahedeen in Mosul.""
The statement did not give the man's nationality but his name and the wording of the statement suggested he was an Iraqi Christian.
The gunman said the purported spy worked at a US base in Mosul airport and ""was known for his allegiance to the Americans and his hatred for the mujahedeen."" He had ""publicly insulted (Islam's) Prophet Mohammad.""
The man was beheaded after ""confessing to all the actions he carried out,"" he said.
The group also posted the statement on its website, accompanied by pictures of the beheading.
The video showed the man who read the statement later beheading the victim with a knife. He placed the head on the back of the victim, who lay in a pool of blood.
The man had been executed ""to serve as a lesson for others,"" the executioner said.
The victim, who appeared in his thirties, was shown in a picture surrounded by the three hooded gunmen with a banner of the Army of Ansar al-Sunna in the background.
""We tell people like him: the door of repentance is open ... Announce your repentance and live in peace among your kin,"" the statement said.
The mujahedeen will catch those who persist in working with US forces, and settle for nothing less than beheading them, the statement warned.
The Army of Ansar al-Sunna has issued videos and pictures of several alleged Iraqi collaborators and foreigners it beheaded.
The group, which is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda organization, killed 12 Nepalese workers in late August after taking them hostage.
Several other foreigners have also been beheaded after they were abducted by Islamist militant groups in Iraq in the past few months.

 Kathmandu: An influential leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML , K.P. Oli, has said the government has to persuade the Maoists to come to talks otherwise elections could not be held for at least another 25 years if the Maoists were to withhold their support.
 He said, as long as the government and the rebels did not accept consensus and co-existence, the country's problems would not be resolved. Therefore, he emphasized, talks should be held without delay.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 15 Aug 04
He said the Maoists had a big role in obstructing the democratic process and pointed out the need to normalize the democratic process.
 Addressing a programme on Saturday 14 August entitled: ""A Peaceful Resolution of the Present Conflict"", organized by the Nepal Bar Association in Kathmandu, he said, if the democratic process is not normalized the split between the king and the political parties is bound to widen. He said, if this process is not normalized, the authoritarian attitude of the king would go on increasing and the system of picking governments would not be halted.
 Another speaker, Dr Minendra Rijal of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), said he could confirm that the present government would hold talks with the Maoists. He said, the Maoists do not have the ability to confront the military for decades and therefore they had to come to talks.
 Mr Hridayesh Tripathi of the Nepal Sadhbhavana Party (Ananda Devi) said, political parties made a mistake by thinking that they had finished their agenda after the 1990-91 movement. He said, only through a Constituent Assembly could a resolution be sought.
 Former Home Minister and member of the dissident faction of the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Kamal Thapa complained that they had received no support from any quarter when they had a dialogue with the Maoists. He claimed that peace could not be achieved as soon as the people wanted. When he apologized to members of the legal profession for arresting them for taking part in protests, those of the legal profession present at the programme jeered at him, saying he shed only crocodile tears. He was visibly shaken for a moment when they shouted him down.
 Other speakers included Navaraj Subedi of the United Peoples Front, C.P. Mainali of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) and others.

"6193",20071590,"Title: Police search for clues in Nepal bomb blast wreckage.rtf; Date: September 2, 2007 Sunday 2:40 PM GMT; Text: Clothes, shoes and pools of blood lay around the mangled remains of a minibus in Nepal's capital, the site of one of three bomb explosions that killed at least two people and injured around 30 Sunday.
No-one has claimed responsibility for the near simultaneous explosions that went off in a minibus, at a bus stop and on a road outside Nepal's Army headquarters.
""We heard the blast and got to the site straight away,"" said local police officer Ganga Budathoki.
""We have found three pieces of a metal container which we think were part of the bomb,"" the police officer told AFP.
Local resident Sarbada Shrestha was in her house close to the explosion site Sunday afternoon.
""When I came to the window I saw that the bus was on fire and locals were trying to put the fire out,"" Shrestha said.
Police said around 14 people were on the bus and all were injured, three critically.
""Most of the passengers managed to get out of the van after the explosion, but I saw three who were not moving and were stuck in the bus,"" Krishna Thapa, a local resident told AFP.
It was not known whether anyone on the Balaju minibus bus died, as all the passengers were taken to hospital shortly after the explosion.
An AFP reporter at the scene said rescue workers were removing two severed legs and a hand from the bus, and the passengers' belongings were scattered all around the small vehicle at the side of the main road.
Home ministry officials condemned the attack and said that security had been tightened around the capital, adding that it was too early to say who might have carried out the attacks.
Nepal's former rebel Maoists, who entered government earlier this year after ending their ""people's war"" late last year, were swift to condemn the attacks and said they had nothing to do with them.
The former rebels said that the attacks could have been the work of groups who wanted to prevent crucial elections planned for November.
Nepal is due to go to the polls to vote for a body that will rewrite the country's constitution and decide the political fate of the country, and the future of the monarchy.
King Gyanendra was forced to end 14 months of direct rule in April last year after massive protests organised by sidelined political parties and the Maoists.

"6898",20082264,"Title: Nepalis Line Up to Vote in Election to Revamp Nation.rtf; Date: April 11, 2008 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Despite  a wave of pre-election violence, millions of Nepalis went to the polls on Thursday for landmark elections that could end a bloody chapter in the country's history even as they usher in a raft of new worries for the future.
  The elections are poised to abolish the monarchy and turn Maoist guerrillas into elected officials. Having quit their 10-year war against the state, the former rebels are vying for seats in a 601-member assembly that will rewrite  the Constitution and govern the country in the meantime.
  Final election results are not expected for what could be several weeks -- a period that many fear could breed unrest, as rival parties contest one another's margins of victory. Political analysts here have said it is unlikely that any one party will win a landslide. In the end, who loses will count as much as who wins, and how gamely the leaders of the three main parties, including the Maoists, accept defeat, no matter how large.
  ''After a long time there is hope things will change,'' said Gita Dahal, 26, as she stepped out of a polling station in  Panauti, a town east of this capital. ''I hope we can live peacefully after this. I hope we can live without fear.''
  In the center of Panauti stood a searing reminder of fear: the shell of a building that housed the local government office and that the Maoists bombed about two years ago, their last major attack before signing a peace deal in November 2006.
  Election-day violence was far less intense than widely feared, given the insecurity of the campaign season. The chief of United Nations Mission in Nepal, Ian Martin, said he was pleasantly surprised to call it ''overwhelmingly peaceful.''
  ''The bigger challenge,'' he said, ''is the political parties' respecting the outcome and working together.''
  The Election Commission confirmed that two people were killed Thursday. One was a candidate in the southern plains plagued for several months by violent demands for greater autonomy, according to The Associated Press. An international monitoring group said one man was killed in another southern district, Sunsari, amid clashes between the Nepali Congress Party and a new ethnic political party representing the plains people, known as Madhesis. Agence France-Presse said a third was killed in a fight between opposing political parties in Mahottari district.
  Out of nearly 21,000 voting booths, the Election Commission said, voting had to be suspended in 33, after rival parties sought to seize and destroy voting materials, in one case pouring water on a ballot box  and burning it in another. The number of stations where votes have to be cast again is likely to rise.
  Of Nepal's 17.6 million registered voters, about 60 percent participated.
  The Constituent Assembly, as it is called, will decide everything from whether Nepal remains a Hindu kingdom to what new rights will be extended to its long marginalized communities to the very system of government.
  Former President Jimmy Carter called it the most ''transformational'' of the 70 elections he had observed around the world. His Carter Center is among several international observer teams deployed across the country.
  In a hamlet nestled in the hills of Kavre district, east of the capital, a group of men sat on the grass and recalled how during the war, the Maoists would storm their homes, demanding food and shelter. After they had left, the security forces would come demanding to know why they had fed and sheltered the rebels. One man, Khetraj Kafle, 60, said he hoped the Maoists would win a few seats and lose their appetite for war. ''If the new ones get a chance, it might be easier for them to live a normal life,'' he said.
  His relative, Ram Hari Kafle, 52, echoed the fears of many when he said he feared that the Maoists would not accept a resounding defeat, and that it would be better if they won a few seats for the sake of peace.
  The Maoist chairman, known by his nom de guerre, Prachanda, or in Nepali, the Fierce One, has promised to abide by the election verdict.
  Even some of the staunchest critics of the former rebels said the elections would force the former rebels to behave, in exchange for any shot at power. That the Maoists would use the polls to try and seize power once and for all was a ''stereotypical and unrealistic fear,'' said David Pottie, associate director of the democracy program at the Carter Center, which is based in Atlanta.
  The American ambassador, Nancy Powell, said in an interview that the Maoists, whatever their numbers in the would-be constituent assembly, would be ''constrained'' by the logic of parliamentary politics even as they tried to assert their ideological agenda.

"7852",20115208,"Title: PLA issue mars peace process.rtf; Date: April 9, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU: The Belgium-based International Crisis Group recently described Nepal's peace process as 'fitful' -- an adjective that aptly paints a picture of Nepal's march towards the conclusion of the peace process and constitution drafting. At times, the process seems to have slipped into a coma, while on occasions it appears to have gained momentum.
Peace will remain elusive unless the fate of former Maoist fighters is decided and all the stakeholders know this. However, no one seems to have the sense of urgency required to deal with the issue.
There is a major difference of opinion between the Maoists and other parties, mainly the Nepali Congress, on the integration of former PLAs into security forces. While the former rebels want a separate force for their former fighters, the Congress is keen on integrating combatants -- as few as possible -- into the security forces.
To bridge the differences, the Special Committee had formed a four-member taskforce on March 23. ""The taskforce was to prepare a 50-day action plan. But it appears as if 50 days won't be enough to do the job,"" a non-Maoist Special Committee member said.
Since its inception, the taskforce comprising Janardan Sharma from the Maoist party, Ishwor Pokharel from the CPN-UML, Dr Ram Saran Mahat from the NC and JP Gupta from the MJF-Nepal has met only twice.
""The Maoists are hell-bent on retaining their control over the former PLAs,"" said taskforce member Dr Mahat. ""The peace process will remain stalled unless they (the Maoists) give up their stance.""
Discord among the parties on PLA integration has not only entangled the peace process; it has also had a telling effect on statue drafting and government expansion.
Until January, the United Nations' Mission in Nepal was there to mediate between the dissenting parties. With the UN mission gone, there is no third party that can help the parties make peace.
Events are moving towards the right direction after Jhala Nath Khanal became the country's top executive, according to the Prime Minister's adviser Milan Tuladhar. However, the fact that the Special Committee for supervision, integration and rehabilitation of former PLAs has only met twice after Jhala Nath Khanal took the helm, speaks otherwise.

The commission had set Wednesday as the deadline for the king to answer questions sent to him on Oct. 12.
However, there has was no response from the king's office, said commission member Harihar Birahi.
Birahi said the commission would prepare its report despite the king not having answered their queries.
The commission was set up after weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations king was forced to give up his authoritarian rule in April.
The commission has been investigating an incident in which security forces fired on of demonstrators calling for an end to Gyanendra's direct rule, leaving 19 dead and hundreds wounded.
Hundreds more pro-democracy activists were detained, and some said they were tortured.
The commission has already questioned several ministers and top government and security officials.
Gyanendra seized power on Feb. 1, 2005, saying he needed to quell a communist insurgency and rid the administration of corruption.
But the pro-democracy protests in April forced the king to give up his authoritarian rule and reinstate Parliament, which quickly stripped the king of his powers, his command over the army and his immunity over his actions.

"3541",2005536,"Title: Another crackdown in Nepal.rtf; Date: April 27, 2005 Wednesday 11:31 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, April 27 -- NEPAL'S KING Gyanendra arrested former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and five other democratic leaders on Wednesday. India expressed its ""deep concern,"" saying Deuba's arrest and other repressive acts by the king were ""contrary to assurances given to"" New Delhi.
  The crackdown is being seen as a major setback for India which had signalled its intention to resume arms supplies to Nepal on the understanding that Gyanendra would engage with the democratic parties. The monarch also cocked a snook at the international community. The arrests come as the king ends a 10-day foreign tour where he pledged to restore democracy.
  Voicing deep concern at Deuba's re-arrest, an MEA spokesman said: ""We are concerned that the arrest and detention of political leaders, student leaders and workers of political parties continue, as do the restrictions on travel and movement of some academicians, human rights activists and students, contrary to assurances conveyed to us.""
  However, sources said that the supply of arms already agreed upon was likely to go ahead because India's primary concern was to tackle the Maoist insurgency that has links to its internal security concerns.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 4 February
Kathmandu, [Sunday] 4 February: Cadres of the agitating Madhesi People's Rights Forum (MPRF) Sunday morning brutally beat up five journalists who had gone to cover a goodwill rally organized in Biratnagar.
According to eyewitness, the cadres surrounded the press men in a tight circle before proceeding to beat them up.
Among those beaten by the lynch mob today were Binod Bhandary of the Kantipur national daily, Mohan Manadhar of the Nepal Television, Shambhu Bhandary of Nepal-1, Bikram Luitel of the Samacharpatra Daily and editor of Birat Darpan Bijaya Pathak. Of the five, Shambhu Bhandary and Bijaya Pathak were critically injured.
According to sources, the incident occurred when the goodwill rally, organized by the Tanki Sinwari Jaycees, reached Bansbari Chowk [square] of Biratnagar, where the MPRF activists started picking off the journalists from the rally.
The forum members beat the reporters, alleging them of not writing news stories in the favour of the MPRF.
The forum members also vandalized a motorcycle belonging to Bikram Luitel.
The goodwill rally was disrupted following the attack on the journalists.
Today's deliberate attack on journalists comes in sharp contrast with the repeated commitments made by the forum on various occasions not to attack journalists and to assist in news reporting.
Meanwhile, the Federation of Nepalese Journalists today condemned the deliberate attacks on journalists. The federation's vice-chairman Shiva Gauli, who reached Rautahat as a part of the federation assessment mission to the Terai region, today said that press rights were being violated with the repeated attacks against media sector, adding that the responsible sides must apologize for such activities and make a commitment as to not repeat such acts in the future.
Gauli further urged the journalists not to let such activities deviate them from their professional duties.
Likewise, the Reporters' Club too flayed the attack on journalists today.
