"3761",20051428,"Title: China pledges one million dollars for Nepal army.rtf; Date: October 25, 2005 Tuesday 5:58 PM GMT; Text: China has pledged almost one million dollars to the army of Nepal, whose military supplies from the US and Britain have been frozen since the king seized power in February, state radio reported Tuesday.
Royal Nepal Army (RNA) chief of staff General Pyar Jung Thapa won the pledge during his just concluded visit to Beijing, where Chinese leaders backed Nepal to resolve the bitter conflict with Maoist insurgents that has cost thousands of lives.
""The aid will be used to strengthen the RNA,"" Thapa told journalists on his return.
The United States, Britain and India suspended military supplies after King Gyanendra sacked the elected government on February 1 and cracked down on civil freedoms, saying the move was necessary to beat the insurgents.
India has since eased its ban.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic since 1996 and the uprising has already claimed more than 12,000 lives.

"547",20031692,"Title: Crooked officials said to cost Asia a fortune.rtf; Date: December 4, 2003 Thursday; Text: Fighting a rising tide of corruption in Asia is crucial to the struggle against poverty, but crooked officials, legal loopholes and public apathy are costing some countries a fortune, an international conference heard here.
One-third of public investment in many Asia-Pacific countries is squandered on corruption, with governments paying between 20 to 100 percent over the top for goods and services due to corrupt procurement practices, delegates were told.
And while suspiciously wealthy public servants in developed Hong Kong are liable to be sacked even without proof of wrongdoing, in countries such as impoverished Vanuatu they are more likely to become untouchable ""big men"".
The depressing facts and figures were presented to representatives from 35 countries attending the Fourth Regional Anti-Corruption Conference for Asia-Pacific, organised by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The conference, which ends Friday, is reviewing progress made by 21 countries which have endorsed an ADB-OECD ""Anti-Corruption Action Plan"" launched in Manila in 1999, under which they are committed to combating bribery and money laundering and promoting public sector integrity.
A preliminary report and individual presentations show a wide gap between words and deeds and between practices in developed and developing economies.
Singapore requires public officials to declare annually that they are debt-free and they must also report their holdings in investments and properties, their personal assets and shareholdings in closed companies.
Hong Kong holds a public official guilty of an offence if his standard of living is higher than warranted by his official earnings, even without proof of bribery, the report says.
But while many countries have anti-corruption legislation on their books, ""legal loopholes"" exist in some and in others the law is simply ignored.
Vanuatu, for example, is one of the signatories to the anti-corruption action plan, but a background paper presented by the country's president of Transparency International, Marie-Noelle Ferrieux Patterson, says crooked officials escape punishment.
""The frustrating thing in Vanuatu is that we actually do have the laws we require to protect the public from crooked leaders; what we lack is courage in enough people to use them.
""Even among the younger more educated people, many hide behind 'custom', excusing and justifying their timidity by claiming that it is against traditional Melanesian values to criticise 'big men'.""
ADB vice-president Geert van der Linden, however, told the conference that while ""several reports suggest that corruption has worsened in most countries in Asia one of the reasons is that people have become more conscious of and sensitive to corruption.""
""Fighting corruption is no longer just a moral issue,"" he said. ""It has become a major tool in the fight against poverty.""
Studies had shown that corruption can cost up to 17 percent of a country's gross domestic product, ""robbing the population of precious resources that can be used to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.""
Van der Linden tempered the bad news with good, saying ""a wave of anti-corruption sentiment has swept through Asia and the Pacific, and many governments have responded with resolve.""
He gave as examples a new Philippine law against money laundering, China actively prosecuting senior officials, South Korea approving whistleblower legislation and Nepal's establishment of a National Vigilance Centre.

"7812",20111322,"Title: Western condemnation after Syrian forces kill 72.rtf; Date: April 23, 2011 Saturday; Text: DAMASCUS, April 23 -- Western leaders condemned Damascus after Syrian forces shot dead at least 72 people in one of the bloodiest days of a month-long uprising after thousands had taken part in ""Good Friday"" protests.
The deaths signalled no let-up from President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces used live ammunition and tear gas against demonstrators in several towns and cities nationwide, witnesses and activists told AFP by telephone.
The bloodshed came amid street clashes one day after Assad scrapped decades of emergency rule and as demonstrators gathered to test long-sought freedoms.
The official SANA news agency said security forces intervened using tear gas and water cannon to ""prevent clashes"" between protesters and passers-by.
SANA spoke of 10 dead, including police, but rights groups put the toll much higher.
""The Syrian security forces committed massacres in several towns and regions today (Friday), so far killing 72 people and wounding hundreds,"" said the London-based Syrian Human Rights Committee in a statement received by AFP.
Several rights activists also published provisional lists recording the deaths of more than 70 people.
Friday's death toll compared with killings on March 23 in the southern town of Daraa, a focus of the protests, when activists said 100 people died.
US President Barack Obama condemned Syria's ""outrageous"" use of violence, accusing the regime of seeking Iran's aid in a brutal month-long crackdown.
Obama also dismissed Assad's move to scrap the emergency rule imposed by the ruling Baath Party when it seized power in 1963 and allow for peaceful demonstrations as ""not serious"" in light of the violence against protesters.
""The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators. This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,"" Obama said in a statement.
He denounced the Assad regime's use of force and ""outrageous human rights abuses,"" saying it had chosen to reject the rights and aspirations of the Syrian people.
""Instead of listening to their own people, President Assad is blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies,"" Obama added.
France also urged Syrian authorities to halt their use of violence on anti-government protesters.
""We call on them once more to engage in an inclusive political dialogue without delay and to put into place reforms that respond to the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,"" said foreign ministry deputy spokeswoman Christine Fages.
""France is extremely concerned by the situation in Syria... and condemns the violence. Light should be shed on these crimes and those responsible must be identified, arrested and brought to justice,"" she added.
European Parliament chief Jerzy Buzek condemned the shooting deaths of protesters and called for the release of all prisoners of conscience.
""Today?s violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrations all over Syria is unacceptable. The bloodshed has to stop now: this is the government?s first and foremost responsibility,"" he said in a statement.
Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director, said: ""The Syrian authorities have again responded to peaceful calls for change with bullets and batons.
""They must immediately halt their attacks on peaceful protesters and instead allow Syrians to gather freely as international law demands.""
British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the ""unacceptable"" killing of demonstrators.
""Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay. The emergency law should be lifted in practice, not just in word,"" he said.
SANA said security forces ""intervened"" using tear gas and water cannon ""to prevent clashes between protesters and citizens and protect public property.""
Thousands of protesters swarmed the mainly Kurdish city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria and Banias in the north.
Protesters in Zabadani, northwest of Damascus, called for Assad's regime to quit and also chanted slogans hostile to key regional Syria allies Iran and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, witnesses said.
About 200 people chanting ""freedom, freedom"" marched in central Damascus but were quickly dispersed by police, said an activist, while 100 who protested in the central city of Raqqa were scattered by baton-wielding pro-regime supporters, lawyer Abdullah Khalil said.
Assad, in power since replacing his father Hafez as president in 2000, issued decrees Thursday scrapping emergency rule, abolishing the state security court and allowing citizens to hold peaceful demonstrations.
But his detractors said the moves were not enough, and the so-called Syrian Local Coordinating Committees of protesters made a raft of demands, urging a halt to the torture, killings and arrests of protesters.

 Kathmandu, 3 September: The anarchic group that wants to rule by dividing the Nepalese unity existing within diversity has attempted to create a crisis of trust in that sweet harmony.
 The anarchic group tried to inflict deep blow on the beliefs of Islam by infiltrating into the crowd of enraged youths taking to the streets after hearing the news that 12 Nepalese youths who reached Iraq for jobs were murdered by a terrorist group there. Muslims in Nepal have been deeply hurt by the rioting and arson at Islamic religious sites.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 4 Sep 04, p 1
This anarchic group, in the name of nationalism, has meted out assaults on the Muslim community which is tantamount to inflicting serious long-term effects on economy, society and humanity. Chairman of Awam Sahara, Mohammad Jinammuddin, told Rajdhani, ""This has undermined the cordial ties of Hindu-Muslim religious tolerance. This is a planned attack.""
 Till today, there has been no trace of sectarian riots, because the Nepalese who search for unity within diversity are fully aware that terrorism has no religion and race.
 This anarchic group becomes active time and again on the pretext of nationalism to drive a wedge of division into national unity.  passage omitted: names of regional, ethnic groups Two years ago, this group tied to create mistrust between people in the hills and people in the plains by spreading rumours that Indian cinema actor Ritik Roshan had said that he did not like Nepalese. The same group has started to ignite Hindu-Muslim conflict now, says Firoj Shah, ex-president of the Shahi Pancha Kashmiri Takia Mosque.
 After paying an inspection visit to the two damaged mosques at Ghantaghar, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba remarked that the attack on the religious monuments is extremely deplorable and heinous crime.

"5269",20066672,"Title: Recent economic boom gives South Asia a chance to end poverty, World Bank says.rtf; Date: September 15, 2006 Friday 12:11 PM GMT; Text: South Asian countries have a chance to overcome poverty in a generation, but much would depend on how they leverage the robust growth of their economies in recent years, the World Bank said in a report Friday.
The eight countries India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bhutan and the Maldives that make up South Asia have averaged an annual economic growth of 6 percent over the past decade. The rapid growth has helped in reducing poverty, but more than 400 million people or some 30 percent of the population in the region still live on less than a dollar a day.
If these countries can accelerate their economic growth to 8 percent and sustain it at that level, the poverty rate could fall to single digits in two decades, the World Bank said in a report titled, ""Can South Asia end poverty in a generation?""
""It's a huge challenge, but it is something within our grasp,"" said Shanta Devarajan, the author of the report.
Devarajan said the recent economic growth in these countries has created ""a political space"" to push for such bold measures that are necessary to sustain and accelerate the pace of economic expansion.
The report highlighted how similar growth in the past helped East Asian countries reduce poverty.
But to replicate that success, South Asian countries need to boost spending on infrastructure development, ease labor laws and take measures to increase savings and investments rates.
Also, efforts should be made to ensure the gains of high growth are equally distributed, the report said.
It pointed out that inequality in India which drives growth in South Asia has increased in recent years, despite rapid economic expansion.
The southern and western states of India have been growing 3 percentage points faster than the populous, impoverished states in the country's north and east, Devarajan said.
The story was much the same in Afghanistan, which has grown at 12 to 14 percent annually in recent years. The economic advances have benefited people in only one part of the country that has remained peaceful, while the conflict-ridden languish amid abject poverty.
""South Asia has the world's largest conflict-affected population about 71 million people,"" the report said. ""Confrontational politics plagues countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, not to mention several Indian states, sometime to the point of political violence.""
Sri Lanka could grow 2-3 percentage point faster without a civil conflict. Tamil rebels have been fighting the island nation's security forces for an independent homeland.
Another key challenge facing the region was corruption and the need to improve governance, the report said.
""Several South Asian countries score poorly on measures of corruption,"" it said pointing to Bangladesh that ranked for five straight years at the bottom of a rating done by Transparency International, a corruption watchdog.

"2020",20043944,"Title: King returns to Nepal capital faced with mass anti-royal protests.rtf; Date: April 11, 2004 Sunday; Text: King Gyanendra returned Sunday to Nepal's capital where police again clashed with opposition supporters, whose two weeks of anti-monarchy demonstrations won a new boost from labour unions.
The king was to huddle with royalist Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who held an emergency cabinet meeting Sunday to discuss the protests that have brought tens of thousands to the streets outside the palace, a minister said.
The king is weighing whether to hold talks with the opposition leaders who demand he form an all-party government after dismissing the elected premier two years ago, the minister told AFP on condition of anonymity.
The king had infuriated the opposition by not cutting short his two-week tour of western Nepal, where state television showed him comforting victims of a Maoist rebellion and being greeted warmly by villagers who view him as a god.
In the latest clashes in Kathmandu, baton-wielding police dispersed 200 anti-monarchy protesters who damaged two police vans by hitting them with sticks, witnesses said.
Police also rounded up 12 activists, some in wheelchairs, of the Nepal Disabled Association who were holding placards denouncing the king, an AFP reporter witnessed.
The royalist government Thursday banned demonstrations indefinitely in Kathmandu after opposition parties threatened to storm the palace.
The threats were scuttled Friday and Saturday as riot police rounded up demonstrators outside the palace, whose security has been reinforced by multiple barbed-wire barricades.
Opposition parties said 2,000 activists remained in detention, but a home ministry spokesman put the figure at 308, saying most protesters were freed after they were driven away from central Kathmandu.
In the latest sign of support for the demonstrations, the two unions representing bus and truck workers in the Himalayan kingdom announced they would side with the opposition against the king.
""We have been caught between the two sides. Police force us to load activists for detention and enraged protesters smash up our vehicles,"" said union leader Yogesh Karmacharya.
""So we have decided to choose sides and support the movement for the restoration of the people's democratic rights,"" he said.
The two unions, the Nepal Transport Service Organisation and the Nepal Transport Service Union, did not specify how they would show their support to the opposition.
But they represent more than 250,000 workers and could potentially devastate the landlocked country's fragile economy by refusing to run buses for tourists or to haul imports from India.
A number of other prominent unions, including those representing teachers and doctors, have also voiced support for the anti-royal movement.
King Gyanendra dismissed the elected government in 2002 and appointed his own cabinet, accusing the main political parties of corruption and incompetence during the 12 years since his predecessor allowed democracy.
The parties have held months of demonstrations demanding a return to elected rule, but the protests grew in size this month after the king promised new elections by April 2005, outraging the opposition which wants the vote held under a neutral government.
On Saturday the king renewed an ordinance which gives police and troops the right to detain people and search homes on suspicion of ""terrorist"" activities.
The measure was first passed by the elected government in 2002 to help security forces battle Maoist rebels, who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy but are not directly linked to the protests in Kathmandu.
More than 9,500 people have died in the Maoist insurgency since 1996.

This comes two days before the end of King Gyanendra's 10-day foreign tour during which he pledged to restore democracy in Nepal.
  India expressed its ""deep concern"" at Deuba's re-arrest. It said the detention of political and student leaders and activists, and restrictions on travel and movement of academicians, human rights activists and students are ""contrary to assurances conveyed to us."" It said these developments would further complicate efforts for reconciliation between political parties and the monarchy in Nepal.
  The police arrested Deuba, who spent 50 days in detention after the February 1 royal coup, to question him on certain financial deals made during his rule. This came after Deuba defied summons from the Royal Commission for Corruption Control (RCCC), which he said had no constitutional validity. The King has armed the RCCC with sweeping powers to try and punish anyone on the basis of information provided by any individual. Most parties describe it as a move by the palace to keep democrats under pressure.
  Security personnel chose to strike at midnight to avoid media personnel and possible resistance by Deuba's followers. They cut off telephone and electricity connections and reportedly threatened to break down the door of the house when they were told to come in the morning.
  Deuba's wife Arzoo told HT: ""All this shows how dangerous the mentality of the people behind the current regime is. The arrest was carried out in an ugly manner."" Activists of Deuba's Nepali Congress (Democratic) shouted slogans when police arrived at the RCCC office. Earlier, Deuba described as ""political vendetta"" the RCCC's move to summon him and his cabinet colleague Prakashman Singh over a contract allotment for the $464 million ADB-funded Melamchi water project. Singh is also in custody.

The announcment came a day after Islamic militants released a grisly video showing the killing of 12 apparently Nepalese men -- the largest single massacre of hostages in Iraq since the start of the US-led war.
The Philippines banned its nationals from flying to Iraq following the abduction in July of a Filipino truck driver.
He was freed unharmed when President Gloria Arroyo ordered a pullout of Manila's military contingent to satisfy the demands of the kidnappers, who had threatened to behead the driver.
Labor Secretary Patricia Santo Tomas said labor and foreign department officials have recommended the partial lifting of the ban amid appeals from the United States.
The officials proposed that Arroyo allow Filipinos to work in two US-run military camps in Baghdad, Camp Anaconda and Camp Victory, Santo Tomas said.
""The president would be the one to decide,"" Santo Tomas said. Arroyo flew to China for a three-day state visit early Wednesday.
The US ambassador to Manila, Francis Ricciardone, said Tuesday about 4,000 Filipinos who were already working in Iraq when the ban went into effect were playing a key role in rebuilding the war-torn country.
Washington hopes ""others will be allowed to join them,"" he said, urging Manila to ""take a careful look at relaxing that ban in very specific circumstances.""
He cited the need for contractors hired by the US forces there to transport food and other supplies to Iraq.

"3894",20051312,"Title: Radio Nepal interviews King after tour of west.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: August 30, 2005, Tuesday
 The chief desire of the Nepalese people is now for peace, according to King Gyanendra. Interviewed on his return from a tour of western regions of the country, King Gyanendra said that while people's feelings about the political situation were mixed, they all wanted an end to violence, to which end he urged the political parties to make a clear stand against terrorism. The following is the text of the interview, broadcast by Radio Nepal on 29 August
 [Interviewer] What was the feeling of the people toward you during Your Majesty's tour of the regions?
 [King Gyanendra] The feelings of the people were mixed. But their desire was for one thing - peace. The feeling the people showed before me had to do with their immediate needs. Some were personal. Some talked about their districts. Some talked about what they thought should happen. But their main desire was for peace and then only development.
Radio Nepal, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13:30 GMT, 29 Aug 05
[Interviewer] What was the situation like in mid-west and far-west, compared to the east?
 [King] To tell you the truth, the whole country is going through an uneasy situation. But I found that the far and mid-western regions are having special difficulties. I think this is because of the remoteness of the area and the prevalent poverty. It could also be because it is so far away from the capital. The eastern region appears more influenced by the neighbouring country [India ]. These [western] parts appear to be suffering more from terrorism and I found that the fear of terrorism was quite apparent among the people here. Obviously, there are difficulties here. Let me talk about the situation of Karnali Zone [said to be the remotest zone in the country]. The geography of Karnali requires us to change our perspective. The territory of the zone lies on both sides of the Himalayas and at high altitudes in places. We need to be liberal while discussing the zone in terms of development. There are places like Dolpa where no one [from the outside] may have gone. I doubt if the government has a presence there. When I went to Dolpa during my last visit to the region, I had met people in Dunai, the headquarters of Dolpa District, who had travelled for seven days from Upper Dolpa. The people of the area are influenced by neighbouring Tibetan autonomous region of China through travel, transactions and traditions. People from places like Humla told me that it was easier to travel through China to go to another place in our own country. This is why I was stressing on roads during this visit. I think you too noticed it. If we can take roads to Jumla, we can have supplies taken from the Tarai [southern plains]. The road to Chchinchu of Jajarkot which is being constructed right now might take another year to complete. This is what the planners have told me. The road goes through difficult terrain but still work is going on. If we can take this road right up to Dunai, even Dolpa will be joined to the national mainstream. We need to at least link all the district headquarters to other parts of the country through roads, no matter what. Economic transactions, movement of people and the like will strengthen the [national] unity. It is not for nothing that Prithvi Narayan Shah the Great [uniter of modern Nepal] described the nation as a common garden of different flowers [tribes and castes]. It is the duty of the institution of the monarchy to preserve all those flowers [different groups of people] and irrigate them. And this is what the monarchy will always keep on doing.
 Regarding you question, certainly, there are differences between the two regions [the east and the west]. But we should not forget one thing. Whatever difficulties we have, we are all Nepalis. We will have to live in Nepal. We will have to do our duty in Nepal. And when God wants, we will die in Nepal. If we have this in mind, nationalism and territorial integrity get strengthend.
 [Interviewer] During You Majesty's tour, people showed interest in issues like peace and development and made requests regarding that to Your Majesty. But they were stressing more on peace than development in their appeals.
 [King] That has come from deep inside them. That is why the state has given priority to peace. Peace is something that is related with the thought process. Not just a peaceful environment, but it should come from inside a person - mental peace. Once you ahver a peaceful mind, it manifests into a peaceful environment externally as well. Unfortunately, there is an element that is spreading violence. They are reportedly terrorizing people, extorting money from people. They people are scared. It seems natural [in such circumstances ]. First of all, what I feel is that they should be allowed to rest peacefully at night, have two meals a day and go about their business peacefully.
 I hear that terror is targetting the industrial sector again. This needs to stop immediately. This kind of disu"

""I don't think so that is part of our approach,"" Sinha told reporters Tuesday at the launch of a government-backed book in New Delhi.
Nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, which are bitterly divided over Kashmir, are inching towards dialogue after a 10-month military stand-off last year. The two countries are resuming a bus service and full diplomatic relations cut off after a December 2001 attack by Islamic militants on the Indian parliament.
Sinha said New Delhi would rather err on the side of caution and stay away from bilateral contacts with Pakistan during the secretary-level meeting in Kathmandu of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
""We want to move ahead with caution through a step-by-step approach and we are moving ahead in that direction,"" Sinha said.
An Indian foreign ministry spokesman also said no separate meeting was planned between the officials of India and Pakistan.
""As far as I am aware, there are no plans for any bilateral meeting,"" the spokesman said.
SAARC, founded in 1985, includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The bloc has few accomplishments to show for itself due to the constant feuding between India and Pakistan, which have fought three full-fledged wars.

If the holding of the 21st General Convention of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) here is anything to go by, it certainly seems so.
  Coinciding with World Press Freedom Day on Tuesday, the FNJ Convention got underway here with a focus on the theme ""Press Freedom for Peace and Democracy"". The convention was inaugurated by former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala at the Royal Nepal Academy (RNA). It was the first time in several months, that so many political bigwigs of different party affiliations had managed to appear on a single platform.
  In his address to convention delegates, Koirala appealed for democratic forces to come forward to defend the freedom of the press. CPN-UML General secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said that press freedom was synonymous with democracy. Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) chairman Pashupati Shumsher Rana and former Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa also endorsed this view wholeheartedly.
  About 900 people are participating in the convention.
  The occasion also saw over 1,000 journalists defying restrictive orders imposed by the local administration to take out a peace rally in Kathmandu. Carrying placards and shouting slogans, the journalists called for the removal of curbs on press freedom and the release of detained colleagues.
  The demand was made three days after Nepal's King Gyanendra lifted an emergency rule that he had imposed across the kingdom on February 1.
  Bishnu Nisthuri, the general secretary of the FNJ, claimed that the journalists were celebrating World Press Freedom Day amid chaos and uncertainity. Taranath Dahal, the president of the FNJ, claimed that Nepal was passing through an unprecedented crisis.
  What was notable about the peace rally was the fact that it took place in the presence of the riot police, who were armed with bamboo batons, but did not intervene. On Monday, the district administration office in Kathmandu had asked the FNJ not to hold the rally or take it through restricted areas of the city. This missive was rejected and the rally eventually proceeded to the RNA without hindrance.
  Meanwhile, the United Nations has once again appealed to the Government of Nepal to lift its curbs on the media and put an end to its controls on television and radio stations.
  ""Allow unimpeded access to foreign news channels through cable operators, end the ban on government advertisements in private media and end the countrywide harrassment and intimidation of media persons and release detained journalists,"" a U.N. statement said.
  It further went on to say that an independent media could play an important role in conflict prevention and resolution. 
  News journalists are barred from criticising the King, his government and the security forces. In the last three months, dozens of journalists have been arrested and at least 12 are said to be still in jail.

  The entire operation executed by the Special Task Force (STF) sleuths to rescue this Cricket Association of Lucknow (CAL) secretary and city's leading timber merchant from the clutches of kidnappers also revealed the fact that how Bihar-based gangs were targeting the Lucknow businessmen.
  Seven of the kidnappers' gang identified as Mohammad Ali of Gorakhpur, Asif Khan, Ajay Prasad, Sumangar Yadav, Awadhesh, Sanjay Yadav alias Maan and Premjeet Kurmi alias Mantu, all of Patna, Bihar landed here and were sent to jail on Friday. The masterminds behind the kidnapping besides Mohammad Ali (arrested) identified as Anil Yadav alias Tiger Rai, Sunil Singh alias Ninny and Bhavnath Jha alias Bhanu of Bihar and Zarir alias Zarru of Gorakhpur were yet to be traced.
  The STF team led by Deputy SP Shahab Rashid Khan and ASP Vijay Bhushan succeeded to locate the victim only after they trapped Mohammad Ali in Gorakhpur. Ali had started making ransom calls at victim Khan's basic phone number at his Lucknow residence after January 15. The cops located Ali following surveillance of his phone number. The gang had sent a courier and a speed-post carrying two audiocassettes and photographs of the victim. While the speed-post was sent from a West Bengal address the courier carried a Nepalese address.
  However, the STF team trapped Asif in Patna after Ali, following cops' instructions, informed Asif that the ransom amount would be delivered at Patna.
  The real operation began after Asif told that the victim was kept in a distant village of Maoist affected Jehanabad area. The STF team comprising commandoes and equipped with state-of-the-art weapons headed for the village. A section of CRPF battalion and the local station officer too were accompanying them but the local policemen had strictly instructed the UP cops not to use lights while moving through villages.
  The cops raided about five villages before reaching to the exact village. The STF team was carrying the dragon lights but they had no option but to move in darkness through fields after 11 pm on January 24.
  When they broke into the exact hutment they found Khan sleeping on the floor in darkness wrapped in a blanket. Two of the gang members were caught from the place. The gang had planned to shift Khan to another village. Earlier, the victim was kept in three other villages.
  Ali revealed that they tried to keep kidnapping a secret but they had no other means to make ransom calls. No sooner they used the mobile phones than they were trapped by the police.

Gyanendra inherited the throne after his elder brother, King Birendra, and his family were assassinated in a 2000 royal palace massacre.
Much of his reign has been dominated by political crises and the raging insurgency by Maoist rebels who want to replace the country's constitutional monarchy with a communist government.
Nepal's Narayanhiti Palace has described the Dec. 23-Jan. 2 trip as a goodwill visit with no fixed agenda, but political leaders who met with Gyanendra ahead of the trip said they advised the king to ask for India's support in the government's fight against the Maoist rebels.
Gyanendra is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other political leaders.
Nepalese authorities believe the rebels routinely escape to India after attacking targets in Nepal. Though police in both countries say they have recently started working together, their porous border has made it difficult to curb the rebels from fleeing and hiding in India.
India has given Nepal helicopters, trucks and arms to combat the rebels and has handed over arrested rebels to Nepalese police.
Authorities on both sides believe that Nepal's Maoist insurgents have links with communist militants fighting security forces in India.

Speaking at a mass meeting organized by the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party in Janakpur, southeast of Kathmandu on Tuesday, Deuba said he regretted the king had said he was ""inefficient"" and removed him.
Gyanendra dismissed Deuba on October 4, calling him ""incompetent"", and took power for a week before replacing him with an interim authority led by staunch royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
He also postponed elections. The new administration is to serve until elections are held, but no poll date has been announced.
""It is only by bringing back the situation prior to that of October 4 that the present political confusion can be eradicated,"" Deuba said.
The king's action has triggered protests from all the main political parties.
The All Nepal Women's Association has collected more than 400,000 signatures for a petition denouncing the king's moves as ""undemocratic"", sources said on Wednesday.
""We handed over a 450-metre long and one-and-a-half-metre-wide cloth scroll with 400,000 signatures to Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand Wednesday,"" former Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist lawmaker Goma Devkota said.

Deuba also said that his party would cooperate with Maoist rebels to restore democracy if they laid down their arms.
""Deuba said if the Maoists agree to lay down their arms, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) was prepared to cooperate with them for their struggle for the restoration of democratic and the constitutional rights of the people,"" said party spokesman Hom Nath Dahal.
While he was prime minister Deuba held three rounds of peace talks with the rebels, but they stalled in November 2001.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, in an insurgency that has left dead nearly 7,800 people, according to army figures.

 Safebagar, Achcham, 28 October: Maoists have started digging bunkers in schools of Achcham district.
 They have said that they will use the bunkers to save themselves from possible attacks by security forces, to launch counter attacks and also for the security of their leaders.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 29 Oct 04 p1
Digging of a bunker has started at Kalikeswari High School in Turmakhad in accordance with the decision of the Maoist District people's government'. They say that such activities are going on in 58 VDCs village development committees . There are 75 VDCs in Achcham.
 Maoists have been forcing the teachers, students and their parents of the concerned schools to dig for the purpose. The diggers have complained that they have had to leave their own work for the digging as Maoist ward people's government' officials have issued warnings that if they do not show up for digging they will be punished.  a ward is the smallest local government unit, within the VDC .
 The Maoists have been using schools as a safe haven for their activities. They have started digging the bunkers as a campaign after interventions by security forces have been carried out even schools lately, according to a source.

"4331",20066649,"Title: Buddhism schools for foreigners in Nepal thrive despite upheaval.rtf; Date: June 30, 2006 Friday 3:18 AM GMT; Text: Since hippies first beat the overland travel trail to Nepal in the 1960s, thousands of foreigners have flocked to monasteries to study Buddhism.
Today, despite political upheaval and a decade-long Maoist insurgency, they continue to come and there are more schools than ever, many now home to Westerners who donned Buddhist robes and never left.
Thousands of masters and teachers fled Tibet with the invasion of the Chinese in 1950 and large numbers settled in neighbouring Nepal, where many Nepalis had been practising forms of Tibetan Buddhism for centuries.
Perched on a hill with spectacular views of Kathmandu, Kopan Monastery was the first to start offering foreigners meetings with Tibetan Buddhist lamas from the foothills of Everest in 1969.
The tradition continues to this day, and thousands of foreigners have passed through. Some come for a one-week course, others for longer courses and a few stay and become monks and nuns.
At first the foreigners seeking teachings were those on the ""hippie trail"" from Europe to Asia through cities such as Istanbul, Tehran and Kabul looking for cheap drugs and enlightenment.
Today, it's not only those who have turned on, tuned in and dropped out who make their way to Kopan.
""Some students are kids who have just left university, others are business people. There is no one particular type anymore,"" says Namgyal, formerly known as Ray Ellis, who became a monk in 1986 and teaches regularly in the monastery.
Laura Guera, a 28-year-old psychologist from Mexico City, came here for a one-week course, choosing Kopan because she was sure she would be getting genuine teaching.
""In your country there might be centres with similar things but you don't know the right place to study, you don't know if people are qualified. Here you have that security that it is first hand,"" she says.
While she was enthusiastic about her course, she points out that it's not a particularly relaxing way to spend a holiday.
""If I wanted to relax I would have gone to the Bahamas and lay in the sun drinking pina coladas, but that's not what I wanted. I wanted to stop what I was doing and have a moment in my life to review what I have been doing,"" says Gurea.
Namgyal thinks that people come to Kopan looking for what they cannot find in developed countries.
""They have tried many things, drugs, money, a good job or whatever it is, but they have got anxieties and problems. There doesn't seem to be any answer in western culture,"" says the monk.
Today there are five monasteries and institutions offering Tibetan Buddhism classes around Nepal's capital and visitors can take everything from a seven-day course to a degree in Buddhism.
The International Buddhist Academy (IBA) is a purpose-built centre for foreigners to study, near Bauddhanath, a stupa that is the religious centre for Tibetans in Kathmandu.
The IBA offers a three-month course in Tibetan language and Buddhism.
""The majority of foreign students who come to receive training from the Tibetans have a fairly mature mental state,"" says Khenpo Jamyang Tenzin, who has taught at the academy since it opened in 2001.
The routine of the three-month course is fairly intensive with classes and meditation from 6.30 in the morning until 6.00 in the evening, six days a week.    There can be occasional culture clashes between the foreign students and their teachers, but never serious enough to interfere with the teaching, Tenzin says.
""Western students question more ... Tibetan students do not question so much, but we generate patience towards them and they generate patience towards us, so it's fine,"" Tenzin says.
Nepal has been ravaged by 10 years of Maoist rebellion and April saw weeks of often bloody protests on the street of the capital.
Kirsty Chakravaty started studying Buddhism in the 1990s and has been coming to the International Buddhist Academy since 2001. The upheaval in Nepal has not affected her study.
""From the outside it looks as if the problems are very great, but once you get here, you don't feel that there is great difficulty,"" she says.
Despite travel warnings advising people not to visit, the centres have kept on receiving students, albeit in reduced numbers.
For Laura, the Mexican psychologist, the risks were worth taking.
""I am from Mexico City which is a very violent place. Dangerous situations don't make me not go somewhere. You have to take care and listen to local people,"" she says.
""It's a challenging thing to do and it requires a lot of effort, but it changes the way you look at your life,"" she says.

"5754",20073449,"Title: South Asia leaders target terrorism and trade.rtf; Date: April 4, 2007 Wednesday 8:03 AM GMT; Text: South Asian leaders were to wrap up a two-day summit Wednesday setting the fight against terrorism and stronger trade as priorities for a region that is home to nearly 1.5 billion people.
Diplomats and officials admitted however that differences between India and Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, looked likely to once again water down any final declaration.
Indian Premier Manmohan Singh met his Pakistan counterpart Shaukat Aziz on the sidelines to ""carry out an overview of their bilateral relations"" and the peace process between the nuclear-armed neighbours, said a Pakistani official.
The talks were part of a series of one-to-one sessions held between leaders attending the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
India has led the cry to ""root out terrorism"", in an effort to revive the fortunes of SAARC.
And the eight member nations have agreed that real economic progress in South Asia -- home to half the world's poor -- was impossible without conquering security issues.
""The wording of the final declaration is being worked out. But fighting terrorism will definitely be in the joint declaration,"" to be issued Wednesday, said an Indian foreign ministry official, who declined to be named.
This was because ""seven out of eight SAARC countries have identified terrorism as a major problem,"" he said.
A South Asian diplomat said it was unclear whether officials from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka would ""agree on a mechanism to combat the menace"" of terrorism.
On Tuesday, Aziz stuck to Pakistan's position that open trade with India depended on a solution for Kashmir, which is divided between the two rivals and subject to a slow peace process.
Aziz reiterated that Kashmir was the ""key dispute"" between India and Pakistan and linked free trade with India to progress on the issue of Kashmir.
An Indian official said the final declaration would include boosting trade between the eight nations -- which has remained at a paltry five percent of the countries' total commerce -- through increased connectivity and improved infrastructure.
India did announce Tuesday duty-free access for its smaller South Asian neighbours and a more liberal visa regime.
""There should be some reference in the joint statement about the effective implementation of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA),"" that was agreed in 2006, the official said.
But until India and Pakistan can agree on Kashmir, trade looks set to remain severely limited.
SAARC, created in 1985 to speed economic development and trade, has made little progress, largely because of bickering among member states -- particularly India and Pakistan.
New Delhi had set the fight against terrorism as the priority from the outset at Tuesday's opening session with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urging member states to implement earlier pledges made ""to root out terrorism.""
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse and Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai were quick to echo the call.
""The real problem regarding implementation of earlier conventions on terrorism has been the serious political differences and tensions between member states like, for instance, India and Pakistan,"" said former Indian diplomat Krishna V. Rajan.
""The same can be said about Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" added Rajan.
Security analyst C.Uday Bhaskar said ""the orientation of some states towards terrorism is going to be the biggest challenge in terms of how the declaration emerges on Wednesday.
""SAARC has also found it difficult to implement earlier promises to combat terror because the members had different definitions,"" he noted.

Part of the money will help rehabilitate areas hit by the country's 7-year Maoist insurgency, ADB representative Richard Vokes told reporters.
He said the bank is still discussing with the government which areas affected by the conflict need the most immediate help.
The funds will be used primarily for the development of agriculture, infrastructure and education, he said.
Maoist rebels declared a cease-fire with the government in January to take part in a planned peace talks on ending the conflict, which has killed more than 7,000 people.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a socialist state.
The Manila-based Asian Development Bank has been helping Nepal since 1969 and is Nepal's largest donor agency.

Ravi Bopara made 96 as England chased India's 280-5 but when he was the eighth man out with England on 270 and rain bought the teams off they were tied on the Duckworth Lewis method.
England hold an unassailable 2-0 lead with just one game remaining.
Bopara was attempting to reach his first one-day international hundred with a big shot but was caught on the deep midwicket boundary.
Ironically if he had just knocked the ball for a single England would have won on the DL method by a single run.
India looked all over the winners when England were 173-5 but Bopara's innings and good supporting roles from Graeme Swann, who made 31 and Tim Bresnan with 27, eased England up to their target.
However the first time the teams went off for rain India were ahead on the DL method and eager to get off the pitch.
They were less eager to get back on for another over and by the time that had been bowled England were ahead before they went off one more time with the teams tied on DL.
England's Ravi Bopara dives to avoid being run out from a throw by India's Suresh Raina (R) during the fourth one day cricket match between England and India at Lord's cricket ground in London (AFP).
Earlier Ian Bell had made 54 but when he and Ben Stokes were out in quick succession England needed a cool head and to steady the ship and Bopara provided it before going for one big shot too many.
India's innings had been dominated by a fifth wicket stand of 169 between Suresh Raina and captain MS Dhoni.
Raina hit 84 while Dhoni ended unbeaten on 78 in a partnership that was the highest for the fifth wicket for India in one-day internationals against England.
Dhoni faced 71 balls, hitting six fours and three sixes, whilst Raina, who accelerated late in his innings faced 75 balls and hit seven fours and two sixes.
But it looked like it would be a different story when India were 110-4 in 26th over.
Swann had just dismissed Virat Kholi and Rahul Dravid in his first over and one more wicket would have exposed the Indian tail.
But Raina and Dhoni got their side to a score well above the average first innings one-day total here with aggressive batting which delighted the hordes of Indian supporters at the ground.
They helped their side to add 109 off the last ten overs with both batsmen hitting the English bowlers high into stands as India finally enjoyed themselves after a dismal summer in England.
In a bad session for England Stuart Broad went off without completing the final over holding his arm and Steve Finn was called on to bowl the rest of the over.
Earlier, Broad had dismissed both openers Parthiv Patel for 27 and Ajinkya Rahane for 38 but Finn, playing his first match of the series, went wicketless despite bowling well.
He eventually snared Raina when he was asked to replace Broad when the batsman was superbly caught by Stokes in the deep. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

 Rebel chief Prachanda, leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), said in a statement that Deuba is under too much pressure from the palace, the army and from a foreign power to be able to create an atmosphere conducive to a resumption of talks.
Those power centers, he said, have essentially told Deuba, 'You raise the issue of talks while we prepare for war.'
 In a media interview, meanwhile, chief rebel negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara ruled out resumption of peace dialogue in the near future, saying the government is making massive preparations for war against the rebels under the cover of its call for peace talks.
 He also rejected secret negotiations proposed by Deuba earlier this week, saying matters concerning the people should not be discussed in secrecy.

Excerpt from report by Indian news agency PTI
Kathmandu, 18 December: Nepal has barred 175 officers and soldiers, including a general, from serving in UN peacekeeping missions abroad due to their human rights records, a media report has said.
Army spokesperson Brig Gen Ramindra Chhetri told a Nepali news portal that 175 officers and soldiers initially shortlisted to serve in UN peacekeeping missions were later disqualified as part of a vetting process following the landmark Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in November 2006 between the interim government led by G. P. Koirala and former Maoist rebels, who now lead the government in the Himalayan nation.
Chhetri told MyRepublica.com that these soldiers were disqualified from serving in UN mission by the Nepal Army due to alleged or proven involvement in human rights violations prior to signing of the comprehensive agreement that brought the former rebels into mainstream politics.
The role of the Nepal Army during the decade-long civil war has been controversial, with Maoists accusing the military of rampant rights violations, including extra-judicial detentions, forced disappearances, killing of innocents, and rape. Some 13,000 people were killed in the insurgency launched by the Maoists in 1996 to install a 'communist republic' in Nepal.
This is the first published report that Nepal has disqualified military personnel from joining the blue helmet peacekeepers based on their human rights record. The move is seen as an attempt by the Nepalese Army (NA) to address human rights concerns, the news portal said. Both Chhetri and Brig Gen Nirendra Prasad Aryal, director of the Nepal Army's Human Rights Directorate, however, refused to give the names of those vetted out. [Passage omitted]
Nepal is a major contributor to UN peacekeeping missions, with more than 60,000 soldiers having served in 40 UN missions over the past 50 years. The prospect of serving in UN missions is a major incentive for the citizens in the impoverished nation. [Passage omitted]

""I deliberately choose to keep shut but I will expose everything at an opportune time,"" he was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post at a public meeting in the southeastern town of Janakpur on Wednesday.
""The time is not far away,"" he added.
King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya and seven other royals were gunned down on June 1 2001.
An official investigation found that a drunk Crown Prince Dipendra had carried out the shootings, before killing himself.
The massacre shocked the world and was seen as a calamity by the people of the Himalayan kingdom, many of whom revere the king as an incarnation of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu.
When Birendra's brother Gyanendra took over the throne shortly afterwards people protested on the streets.
Koirala said he had been keeping quiet over the issue fearing that it would trigger fresh unrest, according to the Kathmandu Post.
Koirala also criticised Gyanendra, who in October sacked the elected prime minister who had dissolved parliament to hold mid-term elections. The king then installed an interim government and indefinitely postponed the polls.
""The king still has the chance to make a correction to the constitutional process by reviving the parliament,"" Koirala told the meeting.
""The constitution of Nepal stipulates that elections must be conducted within six months of the dissolution of parliament, and it goes without saying that the dissolution is subject to either timely elections or restoration of the House of Representatives,"" he said.

Banepa, Kavre [district in central Nepal near capital]: Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist central member Agni Prasad Sapkota has urged people not to suspect that the peace talks might collapse again because they [Maoists] have come to the negotiating table with profound commitment and resolve. Sapkota was addressing a public gathering organized in Banepa [town east of the capital] Sunday [11 June] by the CPN-Maoist Kavre and Dindhuli [districts just east of the capital] units.
On the occasion, he said the talks with the government this time are very different from the past and more qualitative. He also accused the government of holding up the talks on various excuses.
Stating that the prime minister's recent visit to India had given rise to suspicions of conspiracy, he demanded that all the agreements reached with India in the course of the visit should be made public as soon as possible.
Central member Sapkota said that if the seven political parties advocate a ceremonial king, this would not be acceptable to the Maoists. He also said that as the Nepali people are in favour of institutionalizing a republic, the seven parties also should respect this. Sapkota stressed that the seven parties should as soon as possible dissolve parliament and constitute an interim government inclusive of the Maoists. In the course of his address, he repeatedly admitted that the Madhi, Chitwan [district in central Nepal] incident [in which a passenger bus was blown up by the Maoists killing many civilians] and the killing of journalist and many members of the general public were a big mistake.
The gathering was chaired by Maoist Kavre-Sindhuli secretary and Tamang National Liberation front central chairman Lal Dhoj Lama. [passage omitted]

Paras survived a June 2001 massacre at Nepal's royal palace where 10 members of the family, including the then King Birendra, were shot dead by crown prince Dipendra, who in turn killed himself.
The 2001 massacre resulted in the crowning of Paras' father Gyanendra. The monarchy is now facing the threat of abolition following last year's peace deal between Maoist insurgents and mainstream political parties.

The strike was called to protest a sharp rise in fuel prices and the arrest in recent weeks of a number of students.
Factories, too, closed for the day because of fears of attack by students, business sources said.
Students have been staging a series of protests in recent weeks after fuel prices were raised by between seven and 64 percent last month.
On April 20 the government rolled back the hikes by between 2.5 and 6.5 percent, but the students say this is not enough.
The student unions had in fact called a two-day strike -- Monday and Tuesday -- but all except one have since decided not to go ahead with Tuesday's second day because it clashes with the start of the final examinations for some 175,000 higher secondary students.
The pro-Maoist All Nepal National Independent Students Union - Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), however, segregated itself from the other seven unions and said it would push on with Tuesday's second strike day.
Meanwhile, the government has banned all demonstrations in major streets leading to the Royal Palace, the Central Secretariat and other key sites in Kathmandu, home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey told AFP.
""This ban will remain effective for 60 days,"" he said.

Text of unattributed report titled ""Nepal PM's daughter calls for home minister's resignation"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 19 July
Sunsari [district in south eastern Nepal], 18 July: Nepali Congress party central member Sujata Koirala has called for the immediate resignation of Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula. She pointed out that even after the announcement of the date for the constituent assembly election he has not been able to address the insurgent armed groups in the Terai plains and create an atmosphere of peace and security in the country.
Koirala was speaking at a gathering of journalists organized in Itahari [town in Sunsari district] on Tuesday [17 July] by the Itahari Press Club. She stressed the need for Home Minister Situala to resign at once and for turning over his responsibilities to a capable person.
Claiming that the constituent assembly election cannot take place without entering into talks with the insurgent groups in Madhesh [central Nepal], Koirala commented that it was objectionable for the home minister, against party directives, to threaten the insurgent groups in Madhesh to come for talks.
She pointed out the need for the security agencies to take up a new strategy if the election is to be held in an atmosphere that is free of fear.
In another context, Koirala claimed that the Maoists did not want to see the constituent assembly election take place and Maoist chairman Prachanda's statement that the Maoist youth wing YCL [Young Communist League] be deployed for security during the constituent assembly election was a proof of that.
Emphasizing that the Maoist idea was to run a parallel government, she said an attempt was being made to cripple the country's security forces by mobilizing the YCL. She also accused the home minister of undermining the security situation in the country by remaining silent over Maoist intentions.
Arguing that the Maoists have adopted a strategy of using the YCL to ""capture"" polling booths during the election and were accordingly raising the matter [of YCL deployment for election security], she asked what would the situation be if the other parties also decided to mobilize their youth wings.
Koirala also expressed the view that nobody could now stop the unification of the two Congress parties as both the leaders and party workers were in favour of immediate unification. Arguing that the unification should not be delayed by anyone accusing anyone else, she said that to be a leader one had to be trusted by the people.

""There are still Western tourists trickling in from Tibet but the number has decreased,"" said Dasiraj Dhungana, police chief in the Tatopani area on the Nepalese side of the border.
The Kodari highway connects Nepal with the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and the route to the northern side of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.
Truck loads of Chinese goods are also brought to Nepal through this border point by trucks.
The border crossing at Tatopani, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Katmandu, is the main land route between Tibet and Nepal.
China has stepped up security along its border with Nepal and has asked Nepalese officials to be on the lookout for pro-Tibet protests.
Nepalese officials have also met with their Chinese counterparts who urged them to help stop any trouble along the border. Their concern has been possible protests and even attempts to crash through the border by Tibetan groups.
Every year thousands of Tibetan refugees cross into Nepal, avoiding the highly guarded border point at Tatopani and instead walking for days across the treacherous Himalayan mountain range, which acts as a border between Nepal and Tibet.
Most of the refugees eventually move to India, where Tibet's government-in-exile and the Tibetans' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, are based.
As tensions have increased in Tibet in recent days, so too have tensions in Nepal. Tibetan exiles protesting in Katmandu have clashed with police several times.

"3270",20043222,"Title: Nepal in shock as grisly video purports execution in Iraq.rtf; Date: August 31, 2004 Tuesday 4:02 PM GMT; Text: A shocked Nepal demanded action Tuesday against Islamic militants and exploitative employment agencies after insurgents in Iraq claimed to have killed 12 workers who left the impoverished Himalayan kingdom in search of money.
Nepal, which is not part of the US-led coalition in Iraq, said the grisly videotape purporting to show the killings of the 12 men marked a ""moment of national despair.""
In Lele, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the capital Kathmandu, hundreds of tearful villagers crowded around the humble home of Ramesh Khadka, 19, who was among those allegedly murdered by the Islamic insurgents.
""We were expecting their safe return. This is very shocking. This is completely unexpected,"" said Sudarshan Khadka, Ramesh Khadka's brother.
""My brother went there just to earn a living. He had nothing to do with the Americans. We are helpless against fanatics,"" the 23-year-old told AFP.
Khadka's father Jit Bahadur Khadka wept hysterically upon hearing the report of his son's death from a representative of a labour agency, witnesses said.
A statement posted on an Islamist website by the Army of Ansar al-Sunna was accompanied by pictures of what was claimed to be the bodies of the hostages. One of them was apparently beheaded while the rest were shot.
A statement after an emergency cabinet meeting under Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba did not indicate independent information on the hostages, saying the government learned of their fate from the news media.
""His Majesty's Government urges the international community to take strongest action against the perpetrators of this atrocity,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
""This barbarian act of terrorism to kill innocent civilians without asking for any conditions for their release is against the minimum behaviour of human civilisation,"" the statement said.
Nepalese officials had appealed on Arabic-language television networks and contacted diplomats and Islamic clerics in the Middle East seeking the hostages' release.
The Kathmandu government has accused employment agencies of exploiting impoverished workers by putting them at risk in Iraq.
""His Majesty's Government also vows to take action against those persons who are found involved in illegal methods of recruitment of helpless Nepalese into Iraq, resulting into this devastating tragedy,"" the statement said.
Ramesh Khadka's father said earlier the family had taken a loan of more than 2,000 dollars for his son's trip in the belief he would be a cook in Jordan.
The sum is a fortune in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries.
The Jordanian employment agency Morning Star has said that the Nepalese headed to Iraq for work in the hope of earning more money.
Nepal's Muslim minority had issued a flurry of press statements condemning the kidnappings. Muslims make up around seven percent of the more than 24 million people in Nepal, the mainly Hindu birthplace of Buddha.
Nepal declined US requests to contribute troops to Iraq, saying its army was busy fighting an increasingly bloody domestic Maoist insurgency which has wreaked further havoc on the fragile economy.
The statement said the reported killings in Iraq were cause to halt internal conflicts.
""At this moment of national despair, His Majesty's Government appeals to the countrymen and women to show their patience for maintaining peace and harmony in the country,"" it said.
The photos released Tuesday showed the beheading of one apparent hostage, the first with him blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back, before his throat was slit. Two men, one in military attire, are seen beside him.
Other pictures showed the actual decapitation, including one where his bloodied head is held up like a trophy by a hooded captor. The graphic video shows the other Nepalese being shot.

"865",20033321,"Title: School_ Books, 2 takes; SPECIAL EDITION.rtf; Date: July 21, 2003, Monday, BC cycle; Text: You know you shouldn't let your kid carry an entire library in his backpack - just the texts he uses for the day. But a nice book shelf in his study area can help him build pride in his collection of titles. Here are some starters:
- The 50th anniversary of the successful ascent of Mount Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 has inspired several new books, among them Audrey Salkeld's ""Climbing Everest"" (National Geographic, $ 21 hardcover). Salkeld, who has twice made a partial ascent of the mountain (once from the Tibetan side, once from the Nepalese side), writes not only about the victory of Hillary and Norgay but about the tragedies of others who tried to conquer the mountain - notably George Mallory, who with his mountaineer colleague Andrew Irvine disappeared during a 1924 expedition, and eight others who died during a 1996 expedition.
- It's also the centenary year for two other adventurers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who engineered the first successful airplane flight in 1903. ""The Wright Brothers for Kids: How They Invented the Airplane"" (Chicago Review Press, $ 14.95 paperback), by Mary Kay Carson, retells the history and suggests experiments youngsters can do to demonstrate the principles of flight. ""Airborne: A Photobiography of Wilbur and Orville Wright"" (National Geographic, $ 19.95 hardcover), by Mary Collins, recaptures some of the excitement of the brothers' achievement, including pictures of subsequent demonstration flights by Wilbur Wright over New York City and French farmland in 1909.
- The same publishers offer similar books about Revolutionary days. ""The American Revolution for Kids"" (Chicago Review Press, $ 14.95 paperback), by Janis Herbert, guides younger readers through the issues, events and personalities of the war for independence. One of those characters is profiled in a picture book by writer-artist Cheryl Harness in ""The Revolutionary John Adams"" (National Geographic, $ 17.95 hardcover).
- For young history buffs, there's ""Children's Encyclopedia of American History"" (DK Publishing-Smithsonian Institution, $ 29.99 hardcover), by David C. King. The book starts with the first known European exploration by Leif Eriksson around 1000 and moves chronologically through American history to the current era of 9-11 terrorism and the wars in the wake of the attacks. The book also includes an appendix with a listing of all U.S. presidents, states of the union, and texts of the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and its Amendments, and the Gettysburg Address.
- ""Mayflower 1620: A New Look at a Pilgrim Voyage"" (National Geographic, $ 17.95 hardcover) is a photographic re-enactment of the voyage that brought the first colonists to the U.S. Northeast. The photographs are of Mayflower II, the reproduction ship whose home berth is at Plimoth Plantation at Plymouth, Mass., near where the original colonists landed. The book was produced by among others, sailor and marine artisan Peter Arenstam; John Kemp, associate director of colonial interpretation at Plimoth; writer Catherine O'Neill; and photographer Sisse Brimberg. The book's primary message is that the colonists came for a variety of reasons besides religious freedom; some did, but others were looking for land, resources, new opportunities and lives.
- But what of the people already on the land? Who were they and where did they come from? ""Who Came First? New Clues to Prehistoric Americans"" (National Geographic, $ 18.95 hardcover), by Patricia Lauber, assesses the evidence, which suggests that tribes inhabited the Americas for thousands of years before the Europeans arrived. Some may have come from Siberia, traveling overland from northern Asia, others may have come by sea, from southern Asia. To date there are no firm answers, but scientists are gathering tantalizing clues, many of them summarized here.
- Hana Brady, a Jewish girl, was never a famous person, but her story has come to be told by a fortuitous event. Her suitcase - an artifact from the Auschwitz concentration camp - was donated to the Holocaust Education Center in Tokyo. Young visitors urged the curator, Fumiko Ishioka, to find out more about the owner, whose name, birthdate and the word Waisenkind (German for orphan) was painted on the case. In her search, Ishioka traced Hana's history, from her birthplace in Czechoslovakia, through her family's and her own deportations to concentration camps by the Nazis, her death at Auschwitz, and finally, the discovery of Hana's still-living brother. The dual story of Hana and Ishioka's search for her is told in ""Hana's Suitcase"" (Albert Whitman, $ 15.95 hardcover, with a CD radio dramatization), by Karen Levine. Photos of Hana and her family and Hana's childhood drawings are reproduced in the book.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 7 August
Kathmandu, 6 August: People displaced by the insurgency have said the Maoists should hold talks with them in order to create an environment for them to return to their homes. These people were displaced from their villages after the Maoists seized their houses and lands.
Bishnu Adhikari of Rupandehi [district in western Nepal], who was victimized by the Maoists, said the Maoists displaced them from their homes so the rebels should hold talks with the victims immediately. ""The Maoists should talk to us, only then can the problem be solved,"" Adhikari said. He said the rebels should return all the properties they had seized. Most of the victims of the Maoists residing in Kathmandu share the same attitude.
""Just asking us to return to the villages is not sufficient. They should return everything they had seized from us - house, lands, livestock and all movable and immovable properties,"" Kul Bahadur Karki, 54, who was displaced by Maoists from Dolakha [district in central Nepal], said.

Manjushree Thapa is the author, most recently, of the novel ''Seasons of Flight.''
Kathmandu
I WAS at a dinner party in Kathmandu when a journalist friend looked at her cell phone and made a joyous announcement: ''Mubarak's gone!''
''Really?''
''He left Cairo for Sharm el-Sheikh. The army's taken charge,'' she said. No one at that Feb. 11 party, neither the foreign-educated Nepalis nor the expatriates who call Nepal home, had any connection to Egypt. Yet the victory felt personal. A bottle of wine appeared and we toasted Egypt.
As protests spread in Bahrain, Yemen, Iran and Libya, what is emerging as the ''Arab Spring'' continues to resonate here. Just five years ago, the world was watching Nepal as it now watches the Mideast and we had our dreams of democracy.
''I don't know why, but I love to see people revolting against their leaders,'' Jhalak Subedi, a magazine editor, wrote on Facebook.
''We Nepalis, we grew up with political movements,'' he explained over a cup of coffee. He had came of age amid student politics, was even jailed in 1990 for his activism. ''Despite all our movements, we still haven't been able to have the kind of change our hearts are set on,'' he said. ''I think that's why we feel so happy when we see change taking place elsewhere.''
We also approach world events seeking correspondences between our history and that of others. India's struggle for freedom from British rule inspired Nepal's first democratic movement in 1950. Forty years later, our second democratic movement was energized by events farther off: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe.
Our third and most recent movement took place in 2006, when democratic political parties and Maoist rebels united against King Gyanendra Shah, ending a 10-year civil war. Millions of Nepalis participated in nonviolent demonstrations in a show of support. Nineteen days after that, the king relinquished power; two years later, a newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished the 240-year-old monarchy with a near-unanimous vote. With the democratic political parties and the Maoists vowing to work together peacefully, a ''new Nepal'' felt attainable.
Five years later, it still has not taken shape.
Instead, we have learned that it is easier to start a revolution than to finish one. Overthrowing the monarchy was difficult, but institutionalizing democracy is harder still.
Our democratic parties are inexperienced, deferring to ''big brother'' India on all matters political. But India has backed an inflexible policy of containing the Maoists. And the Maoists have also been unwilling to compromise, holding on to their 19,000-troop army and their paramilitary group, the Young Communist League, and refusing to turn into just another political party.
The result has been a bitter polarization between hard-liners of democratic and Maoist persuasion.
The May deadline set for finishing our new constitution is less than 100 days away, but the document remains in rough draft. The will to complete it -- among the democratic political parties and the Maoists, as well as in India -- appears to be wholly lacking.
And now Kathmandu is rife with rumors that the Constituent Assembly -- the country's only elected body -- will be dissolved through a military-backed ''democratic coup.'' Equally dismal scenarios in the public imagination are a return to civil war, the escalation of localized conflicts or the rise of the criminal underworld.
Whether or not the worst comes to pass, it is clear by now that the democratic political parties and the Maoists prefer to prioritize their own struggle for power. They have left it to us to find our place in the world.
This, we increasingly do by leaving. Unable to earn a living wage at home, up to 1,000 Nepalis are estimated to leave the country every day to work as migrant laborers in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and elsewhere in the Middle East and the Far East, often under very exploitative conditions. As many as six million Nepalis live in India, and hundreds of thousands more have migrated to the developed world. In London and New York and Toronto, Nepali is now spoken on the streets.
''Those who could lead a new movement -- you could call it the Facebook generation -- have left the country,'' says Mr. Subedi.
And there is no single tyrant against whom to direct a movement. What we have in Nepal is a ''ganjaagol,'' a mire.
''The thing about movements,'' Mr. Subedi says, ''is that at a certain point, the ordinary person experiences power. Beforehand and afterwards, nobody pays him any attention. But at a certain point, the ordinary person feels his own power.
''That feeling,'' he says, narrowing his eyes. ''That feeling ... .''
He does not complete his sentence, but we both know what he means. So many Nepalis have experienced this giddy sense that change is possible.
For now, we watch others in the Arab world feel their power. We wish them well, and worry"

 Vienna, 10 March 2004: The International Press Institute's (IPI) World Press Freedom Review 2003 highlights the extreme sacrifices made by journalists reporting from the battlefront.
 With 19 journalists killed in Iraq, 14 during the war, five in the aftermath, and two missing presumed dead, 2003 was one of the bloodiest years in recent times for war reporters. Whether reporting unilaterally or embedded in military units, journalists paid a heavy price; many died as the result of enemy fire, friendly fire, suicide attack, mistaken identity, accident or sudden illness.
International Press Institute press release, Vienna, in English 10 Mar 04
The experience reinforced the media's need to confront safety issues, while inviting the military to review their terms of engagement, their lines of communication with the media in wartime, and the way in which the deaths of journalists are investigated. It is significant that a number of deaths in Iraq might have been avoided if combat soldiers had been given the same information as their superiors regarding the whereabouts of journalists.
 Away from Iraq, a further 45 journalists in 19 countries lost their lives in 2003. The most dangerous region was Asia where 19 journalists were murdered: seven of them in the Philippines and three each in Nepal and India. Elsewhere, in Bangladesh, violent assaults were perpetrated against the media and improvements in Sri Lanka were endangered by political intrigue. Moreover, the countries of Burma, China and Vietnam still imprison and arrest Internet users for promoting democracy.
 In the Americas, where 17 journalists were killed, Colombia, with nine deaths, remains the most consistently dangerous country in the world to practise journalism. Four journalists were also killed in Brazil and the country is representative of much of the region where death threats, stringent libel laws and official harassment all play a role in suppressing the media. Cuba also passed harsh jail sentences on 28 journalists trying to report freely, making it the country with the most imprisoned journalists in the world.
 There were four journalists' deaths in Europe, three of them in Russia, with the other found dead under suspicious circumstances in the Ukraine. Throughout the region there are continuing battles between the media and government. In other European countries, such as Azerbaijan, Belarus and Spain, the media suffer violence and harassment.
 Two journalists were killed in Africa, both in Cote d'Ivoire where the war that supposedly finished in July 2003 still exerts an influence. Ethiopia, Eritrea, Swaziland, Togo and Zimbabwe continue to suppress their media.
 In the Middle East, excluding the war in Iraq, two journalists were killed in the Palestinian Territories and one died as the result of interrogation in Iran.
 Although quieter than the previous year, in the Australasian and Oceanic region officials still verbally attack the media.
 Containing 184 reports on countries and territories across the globe, the IPI World Press Freedom Review is an examination of the state of press freedom in 2003.

Rescue crew were being rushed to the scene of the blast, which occurred near the village of Badarmude, 180 kilometres (113 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, Shushil Dahal, an army major, said.
""Initial reports say 25 civilians were killed and dozens were injured,"" Dahal told AFP. ""We are on our way to the scene to verify the reports.""
There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the rebels.
The Maoists have been fighting to install a communist republic in Nepal since 1996. The insurgency has already claimed more than 11,000 lives.
They stepped up their efforts through road blockades and attacks on troops after King Gyanendra sacked the coalition government, imposed a state of emergency and assumed absolute power on February 1.
The attack, if confirmed, is the bloodiest by the rebels on a civilian target since the king's takeover.
Army spokesman Brigadier General Dipak Gurung said last month the security situation in Nepal was ""definitely better today"" than before the king sacked the goverment for failing to control the Maoists and hold elections.
""We are able to focus more on our main job"" of fighting the insurgency rather than containing civilian disturbances, said the general.

Excerpt from report by Chiranjivi Poudel entitled: ""Nepalese leader says international community will be witness to peace talks""; published by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 19 November
Kathmandu, 18 November: General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) [CPN-UML] Madhav Kumar Nepal said the proposed talks between seven political parties and the Maoists will be held with the international community as a witness. He gave this information immediately after his return from an ""emergency"" visit to India. He also said the Nepalese are capable of solving internal problems on their own.
""The Nepalese are capable of solving their nation's problems. So are the political parties,"" he told journalists at his residence at midnight. ""We shall not piggyback; nor shall we dance to someone else's tune."" The general secretary said they would take the international support and good wishes positively.
Nepal, however, persistently claimed that his recent visit to India was not politically motivated. He also claimed that he had not met any Maoist nor any political leaders. There was no political discussion, he added.
Answering a query as to what type of agreement he had in India, Nepal tried to be innocent: ""What type of question are you asking? There were no talks.""
Nepal, along with Khadga Prasad Oli, went to India on 16 November, just three days after completing their two-week long visit. Then followed American Ambassador to Nepal James F, Moriarty's India visit. President of the Nepali Congress Girija Prasad Koirala is in India busy attending political meetings. He will come back to Nepal on 19 November. After the visit, Moriarty issued a statement, saying that discussions on restoring democracy in Nepal are going on in India. However, the CPN-UML general secretary reiterated that his party has had no involvement in such discussions. [passage omitted]
Asked whether he met Maoist leaders in India, he answered: ""No. There is no need to go to India. If [anybody] wants to hold talks with the Maoists, they can be done here in Nepal.""
He said talks held between the Maoists and the CPN-UML some time ago set the tone for the next Maoist-seven-party talks, without disclosing the date for such talks. He said the central committee of the Maoists has addressed his party demands that the Maoists accept multi-party competition, stop individual killings and lay down arms under the auspices of the United Nations.
""The Maoists are ready to surrender their weapons and come to the mainstream if elections to a constituent assembly are held,"" he further said.
He said he was satisfied at positive comments given by the American ambassador to the parties' efforts at bringing the Maoists to the mainstream. [passage omitted]

Five soldiers were still missing from the landslide, which struck close to midnight on Friday at Ramche village, about 50 miles north of Katmandu, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
About 70 soldiers were at the base in Nepal's mountainous north when the landslide struck. Most of them were asleep at the time. More than 100 soldiers were digging through the landslide Saturday to find the missing.
Fifteen bodies have been recovered, the official said.
Three other soldiers who sustained major injuries were flown to a hospital, said Lekhnath Pokhrel of the government's Natural Calamity Disaster and Management Center in Katmandu.
Army helicopters were sent to the area to help with the rescue, but fog and rain hampered their efforts, he said.
Soldiers also were dispatched by land, but access to the area is difficult because roads have been damaged by previous landslides.

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has said the government will act tough on the Maoist youth wing, the Young Communist League (YCL), if it continues its ""unruly"" activities.
Talking to the representatives of the Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum (MJF) at his Baluwatar residence Tuesday [19 June], Koirala said he would take strong measures to check the violent activities of the YCL.
Expressing concern over the recent activities of the league, the prime minister said the government seriously got on to the task of maintaining law and order in the country.
MJF representatives had gone to Baluwatar to submit a memorandum to the prime minister, demanding ouster of the Maoists from the government and a ban on YCL.
During the meeting, Koirala is also said to have assured the MJF that the government is committed to fulfil the demands of the Madhesi people. He also said the activities of YCL would feature in the next meeting of the eight parties. Last week, the meeting of the CPN-Maoist central secretariat had decided to take a proposal of putting a ban on MJF to the government.

"5492",20062874,"Title: Communist rebels clash with soldiers in Nepal , killing seven.rtf; Date: February 10, 2006 Friday 8:25 PM GMT; Text: Communist rebels clashed with soldiers Friday in western Nepal, leaving seven people dead, as the royal government announced its mostly uncontested candidates swept discredited local elections that were boycotted by nearly every major political party.
The fighting came two days after voting in municipal polls, Nepal's first elections in seven years, which also was marred by attacks by Maoist rebels fighting to create a socialist state. The decade-long insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.
Rebels hiding in a forest beside a key highway southwest of Katmandu ambushed an army convoy Friday night, killing two soldiers and a civilian and injuring 20 troops, Nepalese officials said.
Another 25 soldiers were missing, and the rebels said on their Web site that they were holding 10 soldiers hostage.
The insurgents said four of their fighters were killed and an unspecified number injured in the hours-long gunbattle that followed.
Nepal's King Gyanendra seized power a year ago in this Himalayan nation of 27 million people, saying he needed to toss out an interim government to stamp out the rebellion and bring order to the country's corrupt, chaotic politics. He promised to restore full democracy within three years and called Wednesday's elections a first step.
The rebels launched repeated attacks during campaigning and threatened to kill anyone who took part in the elections. Two candidates were slain.
Six people were killed on election day, including a protester shot by soldiers.
Nearly every major political party boycotted the vote, calling it an attempt by the king to legitimize his power grab. They have called the low turnout of about 20 percent a victory.
The elections have been rejected by key international allies as deeply flawed because of the boycott, rebel attacks and threats and government intimidation.
Nepal's Election Commission announced Friday that pro-government candidates had won most of the elections for mayors and local officials. Three pro-government parties won 17 mayoral posts while independent candidates, none of whom oppose the king, won 15.
The United States called the elections a ""hollow attempt"" to legitimize the king's rule.

"618",20032319,"Title: Nepal arranging return of 850 students from China due to SARS.rtf; Date: May 7, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Nepal is looking into ways to bring home 850 students stranded in neighboring China due to the SARS epidemic, officials said Wednesday.
The students or their guardians contacted Nepal's embassy in Beijing about leaving and Nepal's foreign ministry is discussing an evacuation with the Chinese government, said Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Ravi Bhakta Shrestha.
""We are looking at various options to bring back the stranded students as early as possible,"" Shrestha told AFP.
One option would be for the Chinese government to provide transport to a city where the students could be picked up by Royal Nepal Airlines, the only airline to offer direct flights to Nepal.
The kingdom's national carrier has suspended flights to Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis. Officials said nearly 180 Nepalese students were stranded in Shanghai because they could not take Royal Nepal flights home.
If the students are brought back to Kathmandu, they would be checked at the airport and quarantined if they are found to be suffering from SARS, Shrestha said.
No cases have been reported in Nepal of SARS, which has killed 219 people and infected 4,560 in China.
Organizers had earlier expressed fear that SARS would bring down attendance of celebrations at the end of May marking the 50th anniversary of the conquest of Mount Everest.
But Ang Tsering Sherpa, head of the golden jubilee celebration committee, downplayed the impact of SARS on the event.
""We are delighted to note that the SARS is gradually declining and hopefully it would not affect the celebration,"" he said.
Nepal has been hoping the Everest anniversary will attract tourism, which was devastated by a Maoist insurgency. The rebels and government have been observing a ceasefire since January 29.

"1309",20032317,"Title: Nepal capital put under night curfew ahead of Maoist rebel strike.rtf; Date: September 17, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Nepal imposed a new curfew in Kathmandu Wednesday, a day before Maoist rebels were to hold a nationwide strike which authorities feared could mark a surge in violence in the kingdom.
The capital will be under curfew from 9:00 pm Wednesday to 4:00 am Thursday, when the Maoists are to begin a three-day general strike to press their key demands after they ended a seven-month truce on August 27.
As authorities braced for the shutdown, at least four more people were reported dead in the insurgency.
An army official said police shot dead three Maoists who fired on them Wednesday in the Tanhau district, 180 kilometers (112 miles) east of Kathmandu.
He said Maoists shot dead a police inspector, Gambir Shah, and wounded three other policemen when they attacked a station in Rautahat district, 280 kilometers (175) south of the capital and near the Indian border.
""They couldn't fight back the Maoists and eight of the 12 policemen fled with their arms and ammunition,"" the official said, adding the rebels were still able to steal some weapons.
Troops and police also raided a suspected Maoist bunker in Rolpa, the western mountain district where the rebels declared their ""people's war"" in February 1996, a local police officer said.
He said several Maoists were likely killed but definitive information had not come in yet. Tolls in clashes in Nepal are often difficult to verify as they occur in isolated areas.
Officials have reported 142 deaths since the end of the truce.
In Kathmandu police also imposed a temporary ban on motorcyclists carrying any passengers or bags. Maoists often travel by motorbike when they ambush security forces.
""To maintain law and order and to avert any possible Maoist attacks, the government has decided to clamp a nightlong curfew in the Kathmandu Valley,"" home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said.
""We have made adequate security arrangements to protect people and to protect government buildings and public utilities,"" Pandey said.
A nighttime curfew was imposed in Kathmandu last Friday after suspected Maoists gunned down two political activists in the capital, but the restrictions were lifted when no further violence occurred.
Officials said the government would assess Thursday whether to continue the night curfew.
Nepal's tourism industry, a key income earner, fears the curfews will make the kingdom seem unstable to foreign visitors, whose arrivals shot up by nearly a quarter during the truce.
The Maoists withdrew from the peace process after the government refused to call a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The rebels have demanded that all businesses, schools and transportation services be shut for three days to show support for their core demands including the abolition of the monarchy.
A court late Tuesday ordered 21 Maoists including rebel supremo Prachanda to appear within 70 days or face arrest over the January killing of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, chief of the kingdom's Armed Police Force.
Prachanda, a former schoolteacher whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, makes few public appearances and has eluded capture since the start of the insurgency, which according to official figures has claimed more than 7,900 lives.
Shrestha, whose wife and bodyguard were also killed, was the highest-level official to be killed by the Maoists.
His death sent shockwaves through Nepal's political circles and three days later the government reached the now defunct ceasefire with the Maoists.

About 1,000 women, waving banners and shouting anti-government slogans, pushed through Katmandu police lines into an area where protests are restricted.
Police said they had detained about 90 activists, who would be freed within hours. The protesters were forced into vans and trucks, and driven to police detention centers.
The march was organized by women's wings of the seven major political parties that have formed an alliance to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power earlier this year, and to demand he restore democracy in Nepal, a constitutional monarchy.
Protests and arrests have taken place in Nepal almost daily in the past two weeks.
Police - who have been beating protesters with batons and spraying them with water cannon - did not use much force during the women's protest Tuesday.
Female police officers arrested the women who were demonstrating.
Activists have frequently held rallies in Katmandu since Feb. 1 when the king fired the government and took absolute power saying the move was necessary to end corruption and quell a communist insurgency that has claimed nearly 12,000 lives in nine years.

 Text of report by Tika Ram, pubished by Nepalese daily newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 19 July
 Jhapa: Easter Regional Headquarters of the Armed Police Force says its recruitment drive has been hard hit by lack of capable manpower.
 Assistant Inspector-General of Armed Police Force Sanat Kumar Basnet said this following an inspection of security situation along the eastern borders with India.
Nepal Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 Jul 05
Responding to questions raised by participants at a programme in Jhapa on Saturday, [16 July] Basnet said as the able bodied men and women were increasing seeking jobs in foreign countries, recruitment by security agencies were being hard hit.
 Speakers at the programme had asked for security bases in remote areas. But Basnet said security forces were unable to expand their presence due to lack of personnel.
 ""It's a long time since Nepal became embroiled in conflict. In this time, Maoists too have gathered much experience about warfare. For that reason, we are not able to put small forces wherever we desire. The recruitment drive has been affected by the Maoist insurgency too,"" Basnet said.

"5121",20065757,"Title: Nepal prime minister makes attempts to save peace process.rtf; Date: August 8, 2006 Tuesday 12:38 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's prime minister Tuesday was holding marathon meetings in an effort to shore up peace efforts a day after Maoist rebels said the talks to end a decade-old insurgency were on the verge of collapse, officials said.
Girija Prasad Koirala met top politicians, ambassadors from India and Britain, and was trying arrange a meeting with Maoist rebel leaders Tuesday, said Ramesh Lekhak, a minister and member of the government's team of peace negotiators.
""The prime minister has begun serious consultations and he is determined not to let the Maoists leave peace negotiations at any cost,"" Lekhak said.
The government move comes a day after Baburam Bhattarai, who is Maoist rebels' second in command, warned peace talks were on the verge of a collapse at a crucial point, because there has been repeated violations of an earlier, temporary agreement with the government.
Lekhak said attempts were being made to reach an understanding with the rebels on the issue of weapons management and come up with a joint letter to the United Nations.
U.N. peace negotiators who visited Nepal last week had given until the middle of this week for the two sides to come up with an agreement before the United Nations could decide whether to step in as mediators.
The peace talks have stalled mainly because the guerrillas have refused to disarm and disband.
The government side wants the rebel weapons to be locked up before proposed elections but the insurgents say they will only go as far as allowing the U.N. to supervise the weapons' safekeeping inside secured camps.
Bhattarai had also warned that if the talks collapse, the rebels resume their fight.
It was the first such public warning by the rebels since they began talks with the government earlier this year.
""The government is dragging its feet away from all the agreements reached between us and also trying to protect the king,"" Bhattarai had alleged in a speech to the business community in the capital, Katmandu, on Monday.
Bhattarai accused Prime Minister Koirala of protecting King Gyanendra, who in April was forced to cede his direct authority over the government after weeks of street protests organized by an alliance of political parties and backed by the rebels.
The rebels have vowed to quash the country's constitutional monarchy.
""We want to caution and warn him (Koirala) that we will be compelled to leave if the government continues to protect the monarchy,"" Bhattarai said.
Koirala said Sunday the king should maintain a role within a democratic system in the country.
The alliance of political parties formed a government under Koirala after the king gave up his direct rule, but his government did not include any representatives of the rebels.
The guerrillas and Nepal's new leadership had agreed that an interim government including the Maoists would come into existence by mid-July. But such a government has yet to be formed.

Text of press release by Paris-based organization Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) on 7 March; subheadings as published.
On the eve of International Women's Day on 8 March 2006, Reporters Without Borders calls for the release of Jill Carroll and Rim Zeid, held hostage in Iraq, and for six other women journalists who are imprisoned in Cuba, Ethiopia, Iran, Maldives, Nepal and Rwanda.
The organization also pays particular tribute to the family of Atwar Bahjat, a reporter on TV channel al-Arabiya, who was murdered on 22 February in Samarra, north of Baghdad. Forty-six women have been killed worldwide while doing their job since 1992.
Jill Carroll and Rim Zeid, two women held captive by armed groups
American journalist Jill Carroll, 28, working for several international media including the Boston daily Christian Science Monitor, was kidnapped in Baghdad, on 7 January this year. Since then, two video tapes have been released showing her in captivity.
Jill Carroll
On 1 February, journalist Rim Zeid and her colleague Marwan Khazaal, working for local al-Sumariya TV were leaving a press conference at the HQ of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Baghdad, when they were intercepted by four armed men. They were forcibly taken to an unknown destination.
Rim Zeid
Since the start of the war in Iraq, in March 2003, eight women journalists have been kidnapped. One of them, Raeda Wazzan, was killed by her captors, in February 2005.
Six women in prison
Among the 24 journalists imprisoned in Cuba, is one woman, Lamasiel Gutierrez Romero, correspondent for the Nueva Prensa Cubana news agency. She was placed in custody on 11 October 2005 at a women's prison in Mantonegro, in Havana province, after resuming her work as a journalist. She had been sentenced in August to six months house arrest for the ""offence of resistance and civil disobedience"" and had been banned from practising her profession for the duration.
Lamasiel Gutierrez Romero
In Ethiopia, opposition politician and correspondent for the US online news website Ethiopian Review, Frezer Negash, has been in prison since 17 January 2006. She is more than four months pregnant. She is being held at the Maikelawi police station in Addis Ababa but no charge has been laid against her. Reporters Without Borders has protested at this unjustified and inhumane imprisonment.
Elham Afrotan, journalist on the weekly Tamadone Hormozgan, has been imprisoned at Evin jail in Iran, since 23 January 2006. She and six other contributors to the newspaper were arrested after publishing a satirical article about the Ayatollah Khomeini.
At the heart of the tourist paradise of the Maldives, a young woman of 32 is living through hell. Jennifer Latheef, a reporter and photographer on the daily Minivan, was sentenced in September 2005, to ten years in prison for a ""terrorist act"". She was released at the end of December to receive treatment for injuries caused by police brutality. She is under house arrest and cannot move around freely.
In Nepal, Bhawana Prasain, 24, of the monthly Majdur Aawaj, held since 9 February 2006, said she had been beaten by police trying to force her to confess to membership of the Maoist movement. She was arrested during an opposition demonstration in the streets of Kathmandu. Reporters Without Borders calls for the release of this innocent young woman.
Bhawana Prasain
Finally, in Rwanda, Tatiana Mukakibibi has been held since October 1996. She was a presenter and producer on Radio Rwanda. After the genocide, she worked in Kapgayi, south of Kigali with the priest, Andre Sibomana, former editor of Kinyamateka and a 1994 Reporters Without Borders - Fondation de France press freedom award winner. She says her imprisonment is the result of being framed by people in her village because Andre Sibomana was sending reports to international organisations exposing abuses committed by Tutsis in reprisal for the April 1994 genocide. Since then the charges have changed but there has been no progress in dealing with her case and she is being held in appalling conditions. Reporters Without Borders has visited her on several occasions.
Killers still at large
Several women journalists have been killed over the past few years. In the vast majority of cases, the courts in their countries have failed to bring murderers to trial.
In Iran, two years and half after the event, the justice system is still obstructing progress in the investigation into the death of photographer Zahra Kazemi. The only person charged was cleared after a trial held behind closed doors. In the Philippines, the instigators of the murder of Marlene Esperat have still not been identified, a year after her death. In Somalia, there is very little likelihood of a conviction of the killers of Kate Peyton, 39, or of Duniya Muhiyadin Nur, 26. The same situation exists in Belarus, where the authorities ensure that those who murdered Veronika Cherkasova in October 2004 enjoy complete impunity. "

"7740",20112676,"Title: Food adulteration grows by 18.3 percent.rtf; Date: August 27, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU, Aug. 27 -- The rate of food adulteration has increased by 18.3 percent in the fiscal year 2010/11 as compared to 15 percent in the last fiscal. The rise in food adulteration has been revealed in the annual report prepared by Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC).
Out of 849 food samples from all over the country tested by the department, 156 were found to be substandard. Of the total substandard products, over 75 products are found in the valley.
While adulteration of edible oil and ghee has been found to be rampant, milk and ghee of substandard quality are said to be common in the market. ""The problem of quality is severe in high value products like animal ghee, dairy milk, packaged water and edible oil,"" said Pramod Koirala, spokesperson at DFTQC. According to him, one out of five samples collected were found to be of poor quality in the last financial year.
Out of 24 samples of animal ghee collected from various parts of the country, 18 were found to be adulterated. ""Animal ghee products are found to be adulterated with vegetable ghee and even synthetic ghee of varying quality,"" Koirala told Republica.
Likewise, more than 50 percent of drinking water samples were found to be of substandard quality. Out of 60 samples of drinking water collected, 35 percent were of poor quality, and 40 out of 76 samples of dairy milk examined were found to have low fat content.
""Both bottled and jar drinking water products were sold following inadequate processing and high content of microbial load. Even trusted dairy milk brands have not met three per cent fat content,"" added Koirala.
Among edible oils, around 20 percent of various edible oil brands were found to be adulterated. More cases of adulteration were found in mustard oil brands.
Among 156 brands of mustard, soybean and sunflower oil examined, 32 were found to contain mixture of other less expensive oils. Soybean and sunflower oils were found in mustard oil brands.
According to DFTQC, food adulteration has increased from 7.4 percent recorded in the financial year 2003/04 to 15 percent in 2010/11. Koirala added, every year the department has been witnessing new forms of adulteration which can be checked by retaining technicians, strengthening laboratories and increasing investment into the sector.
The Food Act 1967 has provision of slapping a fine of Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 or a jail term of six months to a year on those who produce substandard foods. Likewise, if the food item is found to be unhygienic, the maker is slapped a fine of Rs, 5,000 to Rs 10,000 or jailed for a maximum of two years.

Baidya who represents hardliners in the party had opposed the decision through a statement on Thursday.
""The special committee's decision to hand over weapons key on Thursday by 5 pm is an attempt to disarm and dissolve People's Liberation Army.

Maoists to hand over keys today evening
The UCPN (Maoist) on Thursday decided to hand over the keys of arms containers to the monitoring team under the Special Committee by 5 in the evening.
The Maoist party took a decision to this effect after consulting all division commanders of PLA fighters during a meeting held party President Pushpa Kamal Dahal's residence in Nayabazar this afternoon.
As it was the party's Standing Committee's decision to hand over the keys of the arms containers, the leaders have agreed to stick to the earlier decision, PLA spokesperson Chandra Prakash Khanal informed after the meeting.
Meanwhile, the party has failed to pick the names of new ministers from the party. It is however likely to come up with a concrete decision in that regard by Friday morning, according to party Vice-chairman Mohan Baidya after the meeting.

  The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) has called for signing of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) among BIMST-EC countries as it has emerged as a stronger regional trade group and will have huge potential to accelerate manifold India's trade to ASEAN and SAARC.
  The chamber is of the view that FTAs amongst BIMST-Economic Cooperation (EC) remaining countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal will facilitate India's trade flow without any hindrances and bring it even closer to ASEAN and SAARC. 
  It may be mentioned here that India has FTAs in place with BIMST-EC countries like Sri Lanka and Thailand as on date. 
  The aforesaid findings have been contained in a Background Paper to be circulated here on Tuesday at a Seminar on `BIMST-EC Business Opportunities' to be organised by ASSOCHAM, however, points out that BIMST-EC has already become a very strong regional group, which is not only full of activities but also will prove to be above narrow political and economic considerations as it always attracts participation from its member countries at any given time. 
  ASSOCHAM President, Mr. Anil K. Agarwal said, ""The BIMST-EC region comprises GDP of around US$ 700 billion and a population of around 1,300 million has the potential to become a prominent regional groupings in the region and could further represent a bridging of the two important regions of the South Asia and South East Asia thereby enhancing closer economic cooperation in the region."" 
  'ASEAN and SAARC, however, are devoid of this advantage because of conflict of interest among their member countries on account of various economic and political considerations', highlights the Paper. 
  The Paper further says that Thailand and Sri Lanka can be used by India as joint gateways to increase its penetration to seize larger chunk of ASEAN and SAARC markets because Thailand and Sri Lanka have already emerged as significant regional trading hubs in the region. 
  'While Thailand will provide larger and wider access to Indian industry to western markets, besides ASEAN region, Sri Lanka will help India make smoother movements of its goods and services towards the entire SAARC region including that of Pakistan because of its strategic location', the Paper stresses. 
  It has been observed in the Paper that ever since ASEAN and SAARC came into being, lesser interaction among their member countries have taken place due to variety of economic and political compulsions and considerations which often marred their future prospects. 
  However, in case of BIMST-EC, most of their slated interactions have taken place in time as its member countries are more often than not observed to be taking keen interest in any given time. It is because of this reason that this regional group will have the potential of becoming a major trading bloc to establish and build stronger bridges and linkages between ASEAN and SAARC too, the Paper points out. 
  It recommends multi-pronged areas of joint cooperation among the BIMST-EC for not only working closer but also capturing the market size of developed and developing economies in areas of textiles and garments, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, IT, communication, projects exports in areas of construction of highways, ports, airports and seaports, oil and gas, fruit and vegetable, agriculture products, tourism, tea and coffee, besides spices. 
  For India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, the time frame for products under `fast track' will be July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2009. For Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, the time-frame would be July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2011. For products under ""normal track"" the time frame for India, Sri Lanka and Thailand will be July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2012 and for Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal, it is July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2017.

Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 9 April
Seven Maoist workers were killed in police firing after a bitter clash erupted between Maoist workers and Nepali Congress (NC) workers in Lamahi bazaar area in Dang District [southwest Nepal] on Tuesday [8 April] night.
The Maoist-affiliated Young Communist League (YCL) cadres had held 33 workers of NC in the afternoon, accusing them of travelling from outside the district to help NC's candidate in constituency-1, Khum Bahadur Khadka.
The NC supporters were said to have been enraged after 33 of their colleagues were held and beaten by YCL.
Later, as the tension grew, the police intervened and resorted to firing, which left seven YCL cadres dead and one dozen others injured. Five had died on the spot while two more died during treatment.
Following the tragic incident, the local administration clamped curfew in the area from 10 p.m. The curfew has been lifted on Wednesday morning.
The violence in Dang comes just two days ahead of the constituent assembly election.
Meanwhile, during his meeting with Maoist Chairman Prachanda Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala urged him to exercise restraint.
Prachanda had demanded that culprits in the Dang incident be arrested and action taken against them immediately. The UML [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary, Madhav Kumar Nepal, is also set to meet with PM.

"4657",20066418,"Title: Nepal security forces fire on protesters; opposition says protests will continue.rtf; Date: April 9, 2006 Sunday 4:53 PM GMT; Text: Security forces fired at anti-monarchy demonstrators in eastern Nepal on Sunday, killing at least one man, as the main opposition parties and communist rebels said a nationwide general strike and protests would continue indefinitely.
The death in Banepa, 20 miles east of the capital, was the third in ongoing demonstrations to pressure King Gyanendra to give up absolute rule. The shooting occurred as a large crowd of protesters shouted slogans and hurled stones at security forces, a local official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Representatives of the seven main opposition parties met in the capital, Katmandu, amid a daylight curfew and police crackdown and decided to continue actions that were scheduled to end Sunday the fourth day of increasingly violent demonstrations that saw thousands of emboldened protesters defy the curfew and clash with police.
""The nationwide general strike and protests will continue until further notice,"" the parties said in a statement.
Nepal's Maoist rebel chief on Sunday announced a new nationwide campaign against Gyanendra, including defying curfew orders, capturing highways and breaking royal statues.
In a statement e-mailed to media offices and signed by rebel chief Prachanda and his deputy, the communists also expressed support for the political opposition.
""We support the decision by the seven parties to continue the protests and general strike, and announce we will join the general strike as part of our programs,"" the rebel statement said.
The statement came from an e-mail account frequently used by rebels in the past.
The royal government issued a threat Saturday to shoot anyone breaking curfew. It justified its crackdown by saying it had intelligence, based partly on the interrogation of arrested militants, that communist rebels had infiltrated protests and would attack government targets.
Home Minister Kamal Thapa told a news conference in Katmandu that militants pretending to be pro-democracy protesters had fired at security forces, and the hundreds of protesters arrested by police included four wanted men identified as Maoist rebels.
""We are not going to allow massive public gatherings in the city as it has been verified that there is Maoist infiltration,"" Information Minister Shrish Shumshere Rana told The Associated Press.
Ram Sharan Mahat, a senior leader of Nepali Congress, the country's largest party, dismissed the claim.
""This is just an excuse. They are trying to tar this uprising with the Maoist brush, and to question its legitimacy,"" Mahat said.
Witnesses and Nepali media reported protests in dozens of towns and cities Sunday.
In Katmandu, police fired tear gas at stone-throwing youths as at least 1,000 people assembled in one neighborhood, said a witness who declined to be named for fear of police reprisal. Police also fired rubber bullets, private Kantipur Television reported, showing footage of at least one injured protester.
Another group trying to march into the city from a suburb scuffled with police who blocked their progress, said a police official at the scene who asked not to be named because of the political climate.
More than 2,000 people protested in the southern town of Bharatpur, angered by the death of a demonstrator shot by security forces a day earlier as protesters set fire to at least a half-dozen government offices and forced riot police to retreat from the town's main square.
Security forces killed at least one other protester and wounded five in provincial cities Saturday, the 16th anniversary of the introduction of democracy in Nepal. Gyanendra abruptly ended the experiment last year when he reclaimed absolute power for the royal dynasty.
At the time, he said the move was needed to bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene and to end a communist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the past decade.
Many Nepalis at first welcomed the king's move. But the insurgency since has worsened and the economy has faltered, fueling the discontent that has been on display in recent days as thousands of workers, professionals and business people for the first time joined protesting students and political activists.
The government extended the daylong curfew Sunday to the resort town of Pokhara, where the king was vacationing as clashes erupted Saturday.
Gangadhar Baral said he was among a group of protesters throwing stones at security forces in Pokhara on Saturday when soldiers opened fire, killing one of his friends. A doctor reached by phone at the city's Gandaki Hospital confirmed the death but declined to give his name because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
The government has arrested more than 800 people since Wednesday. Police were seen Saturday detaining another 20 rights activists for defying the curfew.
The crackdown on the opposition has prompted condemnations from the United States, Japan, the European Union and neighboring In"

"7037",20082960,"Title: Former Nepal king says sad farewell.rtf; Date: June 11, 2008 Wednesday 1:33 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's former king Gyanendra said Wednesday he ""respected"" the abolition of the centuries-old Himalayan monarchy as he gave a final speech before his eviction from the royal palace.
In a downbeat and brief farewell broadcast live on national television, Nepal's ousted ruler also hit back at allegations he was a mass murderer who had robbed the impoverished country.
""I have assisted in and respected the verdict of the people,"" he said in his first comments since the declaration of a republic on May 28. He added that he ""will not leave this country"" and go into exile.
The decision to abolish the monarchy was taken by a constitutional assembly formed as part of a peace deal between Maoist insurgents and mainstream parties who joined forces when Gyanendra tried to assume dictatorial powers.
Gyanendra ascended the throne in June 2001 after a palace massacre in which the then-crown prince -- who was drunk and on drugs and furious at being prevented from marrying the woman he loved -- killed most of the royal family including himself.
During his 14-minute speech, the former king hit back at accusations that he was linked to the killings.
""Me and my family have been continuously defamed with ill intentions which was saddening and still is. The accusations that were targeted against us were inhuman,"" said the ex-king.
Many Nepalese believed he was behind the killings, even though an official probe and several independent studies have dismissed that view as little more than a conspiracy theory.
""There was also an accusation that I have lots of property and money abroad,"" the ex-king also complained.
""All my properties are in Nepal. All the properties I have are nationalised. In the last seven years I have not gathered any money or property,"" he insisted.
Gyanendra -- sitting in a chair surrounded by two stuffed tigers and a rhino head -- said he had also handed over his diamond, ruby and emerald-adorned crown and sceptre.
""The crown and sceptre used by the Shah dynasty, I have given to the Nepal government,"" said the ex-king.
Gyanendra, however, stopped short of apologising to those killed during his reign -- part of which was marked by a bloody crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators.
""If any people have been harmed, I hope you understand it was unintentional,"" he said.
Nepal's Maoists, who fought for a decade to overthrow the 240-year-old monarchy, welcomed Gyanendra's decision to leave the palace voluntarily.
""It is good to see him comply with the people's verdict, but he had no other choice,"" Chandra Prakash Gajurel, a senior Maoist, told AFP.
The ex-king is expected to leave the palace later Wednesday.
He will be swapping the Narayanhiti palace -- set in acres of lush gardens in the heart of Kathmandu and set to be converted into a museum -- for a large but drab concrete home in a forest reserve on the outskirts of the capital.
Local media have reported that Gyanendra has asked to keep a 400-soldier close protection unit, but the government said the king will be allowed 75 security personnel.
Gyanendra and his wife, former queen Komal, will also lose 600 domestic staff.
""All former royal staff including palace secretaries, housemaids, gardeners, cooks and cleaners have become government employees,"" home ministry spokesman Modraj Dottel said.
Gyanendra's son Paras -- whose reported playboy lifestyle was also seen as highly damaging for the monarchy -- has moved into a private residence in Kathmandu's diplomatic quarter.

    In a press release issued here on Monday, ADB said the package, which aims at improving the access of rural households to finance  services, will benefit the country's poor population, of which 95  percent live in the rural areas. 
    ""Access to reliable and affordable financial services is  crucial for them to capture the opportunities of the reviving  economy,"" the bank said.
     The bank noted that a high-risk profile, restrictive policies, and security concerns, along with difficult terrain, inhibit the  growth of private institutional rural finance services.
    The Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program comprises  two sub-programs, the first of which aims to consolidate the  fragmented rural finance regulatory framework, begin to  commercialize rural finance institutions, and strengthen the  capabilities of rural finance service providers, the release said.
    This sub-program, backed by a 56 million dollars loan from ADB' s concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF), should create an  environment that stimulates the growth of rural finance through  policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms. 
    A second loan, which could total as much as 35 million dollars, will be prepared in 2009.
    ""Funds from the first loan will be used to recapitalize the  Agricultural Development Bank Limited (ADBL), the third largest  bank in the country that, despite its institutional weaknesses,  remains the single most important institution in the rural sector, "" the release said.
    ""An 8.7 million dollars grant, also from the ADF, complements  the reform efforts by supporting the restructuring of ADBL and the Small Farmers Development Bank, an institution catering to  cooperatives of small farmers. It will also establish a training  institute in banking and finance, and support product and process  innovations,"" it added.
    The second sub-program, after satisfactory completion of the  first in 2008, will continue to promote reforms, expand the reach  of commercial-based rural finance services, and support the  privatization of important rural finance institutions, including  ADBL.
    In addition, a 500,000-dollar technical assistance grant from  the government of Japan, will ensure quality inputs from experts  on ADBL restructuring in line with international best practices,  the release said.

Kathmandu, 2 December: King Gyanendra today reiterated that the government is determined to conduct free and fair elections. The king, in his message to the nation and the people after returning today, said that the country's security situation has improved and has also paved the way for municipal and general elections. 
""As peace and security in the country has improved, the country is gearing up for civic and general elections."" he said. ""The nation's determination in conducting free and fair elections, which is the very soul of democracy, can be realized only if violence is renounced and efforts are made to win the hearts and minds of the people,"" he added. ""Restoration of lasting peace and a meaningful exercise in multiparty democracy is what Nepal needs and what the Nepalese people are yearning for,"" the monarch said. ""Such a state of affairs is a matter of joy to all those who believe in democracy, and any contribution towards strengthening this situation which will restore sustainable peace and enable the elected representatives to govern is praiseworthy,"" he added. 
The monarch also said that it is obvious that a consensus can be achieved only if the national psyche of the Nepalese people, who have always remained independent throughout history, and patriotism are made the focal point. He thanked the chairman of the Council of Royal Representatives, Crown Prince Paras, and other members for discharging their duties during his absence. The king also expressed happiness at returning home after participating in the 13th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held in Dhaka and the World Summit on Information Society in Tunis. The monarch also said that his participation in the world summit on the Information Society has, he believes, contributed to bridging the digital divide between developing countries and the developed world, focusing on the opportunity and challenges faced by the global community in translating into reality an inclusive information society, ensuring information and communication technology for the progress of all.

"4223",20053035,"Title: Nepal 's king lifts state of emergency in apparent bow to international pressure.rtf; Date: April 29, 2005, Friday, BC cycle; Text: Nepal's King Gyanendra on Saturday lifted a state of emergency he imposed after seizing power in February, apparently bowing to strong international pressure to restore democracy in the Himalayan nation.
Gyanendra imposed emergency rule on Feb. 1. after firing the government, taking absolute power and suspending civil liberties in a move widely condemned both at home and abroad. He said the ousted leaders had failed to quell a communist insurgency or hold parliamentary elections.
""His Majesty in accordance with the constitution has lifted the order of the state of emergency,"" a brief palace statement said Saturday.
The announcement did not elaborate, but legal experts said all the suspended rights have been restored including freedom of press, right to information, assemble peacefully, freedom of movement and constitutional protection against preventive detention.
The surprise decision came after the king's return on Friday from visits to China, Indonesia and Singapore, where leaders pressed him to restore democracy in Nepal.
Gyanendra met several leaders on the sidelines of an African-Asian Summit in Indonesia last week, including Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The meeting with Singh was crucial, because India - a key source of arms for Nepal's fight against a communist insurgency - suspended aid to Nepal after Gyanendra's power grab.
Since the royalist takeover, hundreds of politicians have been jailed and protests against the king and his royal government have been banned.
After dismissing the government, Gyanendra accused its leaders of failing to conduct parliamentary elections and being unable quell the insurgency, which has raged since 1996. The king quickly formed a government under his chairman and hand-picked his close supporters as ministers.
He said he would maintain direct rule for three years.
Nepal has been in turmoil since Gyanendra, 55, suddenly assumed the crown in 2001 after his brother, King Birendra, was gunned down in a palace massacre apparently committed by Birendra's son, the crown prince, who also died. Ten members of the royal family were killed.
The rebels, who draw inspiration from the late Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been trying to overthrow the government and establish a socialist state.
More than 11,500 people have died since the fighting began.
In a second announcement by the palace, the king gave continuation to the Royal Commission on Corruption Control which he had formed after taking over power. The commission was first formed under emergency provisions but since emergency is over, the king had to make this technical adjustment.

Excerpt from report by Narayan Sharma headlined ""Nepal border area again encroached by Indians"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 11 July
Tribeni (Nawalparasi [district in western Nepal]), 10 July: Indians have once again encroached on Nepal's land in Susta area [in southern Nepal] since the first week of [Nepali month of] Asar [around last week of June]. Indians have encroached on some 300 plots of land and begun cultivation.
Last year, Indians made repeated attempts to encroach on Nepal's land in the area but stopped after objections were raised by the local people.
""Three hundred bighas [plots] of our cultivated land has been encroached upon"", the convener of the Save Susta Campaign and local resident Gopal Gurung said. He added ""we approached the higher authorities to get the encroachment stopped, but they showed no concern and we have been left helpless"". Locals at Susta have accused the government of apathy despite repeated demands to stop the encroachment.
""Every day the Indians till our land with tractors and plant paddy. They have been cultivating more than 150 bighas of land north of Dhanaiya in Susta"", Gurung said.
Since the last week of June, Indians from the border areas have been encroaching Nepali land right up to the Gandak barrage. As the land is at a distance from the villages, patrolling around the clock has not been possible, local farmers said. [Passage omitted].
The chief district officer in Nawalparasi, Govinda Khan, said he was not informed by the deputy superintendent of armed police stationed at Susta. ""The border is not clear, the higher authorities should be looking into this,"" he said over the phone, adding that he would ""make inquiries and find out more"".
The Indian paramilitary force has stationed a 90-member team at no man's land at a place called Aina since the past few months. Earlier also, Indian security teams have been positioned some eight kilometres inside Nepal.
While Indian security personnel have been patrolling the no man's land area daily, Nepali security personnel have not gone out on patrol citing lack of orders from higher officials.

""There was shooting this morning near Fataki"", about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Bunia, capital of the Ituri region, where regular army DRC troops (FARDC) halted a rebel militia advance on their positions, their commander in Ituri General Vainqueur Mayala told AFP.
""There have been no dead or wounded, according to reports so far,""  he said by phone from Bunia. 
The UN and the FARDC have jointly launched a ""weaponless district"" operation, announced in January and initiated Tuesday. Mayala said some arms had already been seized by patrols.
At the end of December rebels led by militia commander Peter Karim in the Fataki area were involved in fighting, before a ceasefire was declared and the government established negotiations which were hoped to lead to a disarming of the militias.
The latest incidents took place in a atmosphere of heightened tension in Ituri, where the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) has increased overflights of Karim's bases and is ready to back an offensive by regular forces against the rebel militia.
MONUC's military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Didier Rancher on Wednesday described Karim at a news conference as a ""dinosaur incapable of evolving towards peace"" and condemned his systematic failure to keep his promises.
Since July 2006 Karim, a former member of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) militia, has been promising to demobilise his forces in return for a general amnesty and a colonel's rank in the FARDC, which he has obtained.
He is accused of crimes against civilians and the trafficking of goods to neighbouring Uganda, and is blamed by MONUC for an attack on a UN helicopter which killed a Nepalese peacekeeper in 2005.
He is the last rebel chief resisting a demobilisation process which since the end of 2005 has seen 15,000 combattants lay down their arms in Ituri. The region is rich in gold and fighting between armed groups and inter-ethnic violence have taken more than 60,000 lives since 1999, according to humanitarian groups.
""We still hope to persuade Karim through dialogue, but we have already done a lot,"" said Mayala. ""Who wants peace prepares war, he knows that very well.""

 Kathmandu, 12 September: The US government has decided not to exercise the waiver (by the US secretary of state) that would have allowed resumption of lethal weapons assistance to the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA). The information, provided by Human Rights Watch to the Post, was confirmed by the US embassy spokesperson in Kathmandu on Monday [12 September]. ""We have informed the Nepal government that the US State Department is not using the waiver under National Security Council on arms supply to Nepal,"" said Robert Hugins, public affairs officer of the US embassy, Kathmandu.
Kantipuronline.com website, Kathmandu, in English 13 Sep 05
Replying to a question, Hugins added that the decision of the State Department to continue to withhold lethal arms supply to Nepal was taken ""this month"" and was conveyed to the Nepalese government ""recently"". The US government was to give about 5m dollars military aid to Nepal for fiscal year 2005 under Foreign Military Financing (FMF). However, with reports accusing the RNA-led unified command of the security forces of blatant human rights violations and impunity for soldiers, the US Congress, in November 2004, tied the military assistance to improvement in human rights.
 The US Congress, while passing the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill (for fiscal year 2005), on 23 November, mandated that the US secretary of state certify that the Royal Nepalese Army was complying with the four conditions: honor habeas corpus orders of the Supreme Court, allow the National Human Rights Commission unimpeded access to RNA detention centres, take steps to end torture and end the culture of impunity for the army.
 The measure was passed under the Leahy Amendment, which precludes any military unit anywhere in the world from receiving US military assistance, if those units are known to have been involved in gross human rights violations. The secretary of state may waive the requirements, if she ""reports to the committees on appropriations that to do so is in the national security interest of the United States"", the bill states.

""The defense ministry has evidence that Nepalese Maoists are receiving arms training in India's Bihar and Jharkhand states and this information has been passed on to the home ministry,"" The Tribune newspaper quoted India's Defense Minister George Fernandes as saying.
Action has been initiated on this front, Fernandes said in a speech at a defense seminar in the northern city of Chandigarh. The newspaper report didn't specify what sort of action the army had taken.
There was no immediate comment from the Indian Defense Ministry.
India has provided Nepal with a helicopter, rifles, machine guns and mortars to help in its fight against the communist insurgency that has claimed more than 7,000 lives in the past seven years. The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, want to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
Communist rebels have also been active in five Indian southern and eastern states since 1981.
The insurgents mostly target rich landowners and police, accusing them of colluding in the exploitation of farmers and rural laborers.
Last week, Nepal's Maoist rebels called on the United States, India and China to stop interfering in Nepal's internal affairs.
The rebels have been especially critical of Washington because it has provided the Nepalese government with more than US$20 million in military aid, including training and small arms.
In August, the rebels pulled out of peace talks with Nepal's government as well as a seven-month cease-fire. They have since stepped up their offensive. Nearly 200 people have died since then.

 During his stay in Dang, His Majesty the King travelled to Tulsipur and acquired information on the problems faced by the people from the people themselves. His Majesty spent nearly three hours talking with the people.
 During their direct meeting with the king, the people expressed their desire for peace. ""How long will we continue to be haunted by the fighting? We need peace and development,"" the majority of the Dang people implored the king. In reply, the king said ""appropriate measures"" will be taken in this regard.

 Shortage of food and other daily consumer goods has badly hit the western district of Gulmi at the time of Dashain, a period when the consumption of essential commodities rises sharply.
 The shortage has been experienced due largely to damaged roads.
The Kathmandu Post, Kathmandu, in English 29 Sep 03The two dozen rural motorable roads of the district remain damaged by the monsoon rains.
 ""The problem has worsened further due to the closure of main roads connecting the district headquarters of Tamghas with Palpa and Butwal,"" said businessmen from Tamghas.
 Tamghas, the headquarters of the Gulmi District, depends on supplies from Palpa and Butwal to meet local demand.  passage omitted The latest problem would affect the consumers more as they would have to pay higher prices for essential goods during the festive season.
 In the earlier years, all motorable roads of Gulmi used to be maintained and brought into operation about a month prior to the Dashain festival. This year this seems very unlikely as no efforts have been made to maintain the damaged roads.
 Major roads of Tamghas like Seugha-Simaghat, Purkot-Seugha and Chaurasi-Purkot-Pyuthan, among others, are closed for the last three months. Even the main roads connecting Tamghas with Tansen, the district headquarters of Palpa, is not in a motorable condition.  passage omitted
 The problem is worse in VDCs village development committee areas like Hastichaur, Darlamchaur, Ishma, Rajasthal, Sirseni, Bhanbhane, Hadhade, Pipaltari, Arje, Arkhabang, Marbhung and Bhojkateri, among others.

"4299",20063577,"Title: Nepal 's great gamble_ Former enemies politicians and rebels unite against king.rtf; Date: April 6, 2006 Thursday 3:43 PM GMT; Text: In the biggest political gamble in Nepal in years, opposition politicians and communist rebels have struck an unlikely alliance to oppose the ruler of this Himalayan kingdom.
But as a four-day nationwide strike called by the country's major political parties and backed by the Maoist insurgents began Thursday, the royal government pressed its crackdown against the opposition.
The Maoists, meanwhile, took 28 hostages in a raid on a southern town that left at least 13 people dead.
Troops across the country were ordered to stop protests, and police in Katmandu arrested scores of protesters, chasing them down narrow lanes and beating them with batons.
One protest leader, Khadga Prasad Oli, told The Associated Press that about 300 people were arrested at 16 different protests in the capital. Another 60 men were arrested at a demonstration southwest of Katmandu, he said, pledging more protests Friday.
But Home Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey confirmed only 177 arrests, saying the protesters attacked police and were being held until officials decided how to proceed.
The government argues that the politicians' agreement with the Maoists gives legitimacy to the rebels' violent methods, but the political parties say it is the only hope to end bloodshed that has killed 13,000 people over the past decade.
Working with the Maoists ""is a gamble,"" said Ram Sharan Mahat of the Nepali Congress, the largest party.
""But you have to recognize that the Maoists are a political force and no political solution will come without bringing them on board,"" he said. ""There might be many 'ifs' and 'buts', but we want to give them an honorable political exit (from violence).""
Information Minister Shrish Shumshere Rana dismissed the claim.
""We are not quite convinced that the agreement is going to stop terrorism, in fact it will encourage it,"" Rana said in an interview. ""It is just a convenient rug under which terror hides.""
""The parties want to be democratic as well as court the terrorists,"" he said.
The militants and the parties reached their pact last December, hoping to pressure the king to give up the absolute power he seized last year.
Although the king has refused to budge, the deal has given the Maoists the political stage they have long sought.
Following the intense international crackdown against terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, some say there was no other way forward for the rebels.
""The Maoists are under great pressure. They want a face-saving device,"" said political analyst Lok Raj Baral. ""How long can they go on fighting? There is no international support, no foreign funds, no weapons coming in from overseas.""
Since allying with the political parties, the militants have promised to end human rights abuses, and no longer insist on the immediate creation of a communist state.
The alliance wants an elected constituent assembly to decide on a future political structure. The militants say they support multiparty rule and have promised to give up their arms after a new constitution is written.
But in the interim, they've refused to renounce violence in fact, they've stepped up attacks on government forces. Human rights groups and diplomats say the rebels also still regularly commit rights violations and use child soldiers.
Critics of the alliance fear the rebels are simply using the opposition.
If the king fell, ""the Maoists would be armed; the parties would be unarmed,"" U.S. Ambassador James Moriarty said in a speech earlier this year. ""This stark scenario leaves the parties, and the people, defenseless against ideological 'partners' long used to settling arguments with a gun.""
On Thursday, the rebels attacked government buildings and security forces in Malangawa, about 75 miles south of Katmandu, taking a local official and 27 police officers hostage, said police official Rajan Limbu.
Six policemen, five rebels and two civilians were killed, a police official said on condition of anonymity for security reasons.
A helicopter also crashed during the fighting, and the rebels claimed they had shot it down. The defense ministry later said it crashed, killing 10 soldiers on board, dismissing the rebels' claim.
Nepal's last big political gamble was played by a king, 16 years ago.
In 1990, the late King Birendra, faced with widespread political agitation, gave up absolute power, created a democracy and become a ceremonial monarch.
But the politicians quickly began squabbling amid allegations of poor governance and corruption.
Poverty spiraled, outrage spread, and in the remote western mountains, the Maoist insurgency began in 1996 with 70 men and two World War II-era guns.
The Maoists now have thousands of fighters, and wield broad influence over much of rural Nepal.
In early 2005, amid political squabbling and militant violence, Nepal's king seized back the power that his elder brother had given up.

"3232",200419,"Title: UN expresses serious concern on enforced disappearances.rtf; Date: August 27, 2004 Friday 1:00 PM EST; Text: A human rights working group of the United Nations on Friday expressed serious concern on phenomenon  of disappearances that continues to occur in scores of countries.
    The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances  (WGEID) expressed its concern in a message issued here when the  International Day of the Disappeared (Aug. 30) is approaching.  
    ""While in the past disappearances were mainly associated with  the state policies of authoritarian regimes, nowadays they occur  in the context of much more complex situations of internal  conflict generating violence, humanitarian crisis, and human  rights violations,"" said the working group.
    WGEID was established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1980 to assist the relatives of disappeared persons in  ascertaining their fate and whereabouts and to act as a channel  for communication between the families and governments concerned.
    The working group expressed particular concern over reports  received from non-governmental organizations on the situation in  countries such as Nepal, Colombia and Russia. 
    According to these reports, the fate of more than 890  disappeared persons is still unknown in Colombia, and the figures  for Nepal and Russia are 130 and 270. 
    The practice of enforced or involuntary disappearance of  persons infringes upon an entire range of human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and set out in both  International Covenants on Human Rights as well as in other major  international human rights instruments, said WGEID.
    The working group called upon all governments to take action to prevent disappearances, and in particular to end the practice of  secret detentions.
    In addition, it said, all governments must end impunity for  security forces and armed bands who perpetrate disappearances, and must make every effort to discover the fate of disappeared persons, share that information with family and friends of the disappeared, and provide compensation in the case of death.
    On the occasion of the International Day of the Disappeared,  the working group reaffirmed that the act of committing enforced  or involuntary disappearances is a crime with severe consequences, not only for victims and for relatives and friends of the victim,  but also for entire societies and for the credibility of states.

"790",20031412,"Title: Free trade accord offers tantalizing prospects for growth in South Asia.rtf; Date: December 29, 2003 Monday; Text: As longtime bitter rivals India and Pakistan try to mend ties, business and political leaders in both neighbor countries are salivating over the potential peace dividends.
Open borders, a common currency and a regional trade boom are among possible results if the two can finally end their half-century of suspicion, hatred and war.
A free trade agreement - expected to be signed next week at the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC - could lead to rapid economic growth in one of the world's poorest regions.
""If confidence is built between India and Pakistan, business will flourish in the entire region,"" said Vinnie Mehta, head of the New Delhi-based Manufacturers Association of Information Technology.
SAARC, which groups India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives, has long been hostage to the hostility between India and Pakistan, its two largest members.
The group was set up in 1985 to promote free trade and economic cooperation in a region that's home to one-fifth of the world's population.
But 18 years later, trade within the region remains abysmally low, amounting to only 5 percent of the member countries' combined global trade.
SAARC members have already missed two deadlines to agree on a South Asian Free Trade Area, in 2001 and 2002, when India-Pakistan hostilities held up the deal.
Trade groups and businesses hope that this time, New Delhi and Islamabad will look beyond their differences and sign the agreement, making the free trade zone operational by January 2006.
""If business relations improve, we will be able to break the impasse between the two countries,"" said Kiran Karnik of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the biggest collective of India's burgeoning information technology powerhouses.
Official India-Pakistan trade totals US$200 million a year, but indirect trade through Dubai or Singapore is estimated at US$1 billion.
Bad blood between India and Pakistan has also kept them from seeing each other as the closest - and often cheapest - source of imports.
Pakistan is a big tea importer, but buys very little from India. Instead, it turns to faraway Kenya or Sri Lanka.
""Just think of the transportation costs that could be saved if we were to send Indian tea by road to Pakistan,"" said Subhash Mittal of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations.
Similar savings are possible if Pakistan imports wheat, sugar, tires, medicines and machines from India. And India could buy fabrics and chemicals from Pakistan.
Ilyas Ahmed Bilour, a Pakistani who is president of the India-Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, sees even greater possible advantages.
""We should be allowed to send Pakistani goods to Bhutan and Bangladesh through the land route across India,"" Bilour said.
Stable relations could lead to joint ventures and long-term investments, said Ajay Khanna of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
Direct India-Pakistan trade alone could quadruple, he said.
""If we were to let our imagination flow, we can look to developing a transshipment cargo hub between Bombay and Karachi (Pakistan's major port), servicing the Middle East, Africa and West Asia,"" said Khanna.
Citing the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean region, where historical differences have been set aside to form regional economic arrangements, Indian and Pakistani leaders have even suggested a common South Asian currency.
Many of the possibilities hinge on India-Pakistan efforts to resolve their competing claims to the Himalayan enclave of Kashmir, which is divided between them and has been the focus of two of their three wars since their 1947 independence from Britain.
Islamic militants have been fighting since 1989 for Muslim-majority Kashmir's independence from mainly Hindu India, or its merger with mostly Muslim Pakistan. More than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed, and the local economy destroyed.
India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the militants, based in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge.
The two nuclear-armed rivals came to the brink of a fourth war in December 2001. But relations are thawing, diplomats are returning and transportation links are resuming. Both countries' leaders are promising dialogue.

"5595",20066440,"Title: Nepal steps up security ahead of general strike called by communist rebels.rtf; Date: February 3, 2006 Friday 4:24 AM GMT; Text: Security was stepped up across Nepal on Friday following an increase in attacks by communist rebels, who have called a seven-day general strike aimed at disrupting next week's municipal elections.
Home Minister Kamal Thapa urged citizens to reject next week's strike call, saying businesses, schools and transport would be protected against rebel attacks.
""Security arrangements have been improved and more troops have been mobilized to control violence,"" Thapa said, without giving details.
""We are urging the people to reject violence and terror and ignore the threats by the insurgents. Everyone should team up to foil the strike,"" Thapa said.
The rebels have called a nationwide strike for one week starting Sunday to disrupt next Wednesday's elections in Nepal's 58 cities and towns. Markets, schools and businesses usually close during the strikes because the rebels are known to attack those who defy their orders.
The Maoist rebels, who are fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a socialist state, have increased attacks since withdrawing from a cease-fire last month.
The rebels have bombed the houses of several mayoral candidates in the past few days and launched a major attack in a western Nepal town, killing at least 20 security personnel and taking dozens of others hostage.
The guerrillas, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to replace the constitutional monarchy with a socialist state. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.

"5895",2007839,"Title: FIGHTING TERRORISM NEEDS COLLECTIVE APPROACH'_ GEN. J.J. SINGH.rtf; Date: February 23, 2007 Friday 2:34 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Feb 23 -- The Government of India's Ministry of Defence issued the following press release:
 The second day of the International Seminar of the Indian Army on the subject ""Emerging World Order: Implications for the Security Calculus of the Extended South Asian Region"" commenced with a Key Note Address by the well known Columnist, Dr C Raja Mohan. He spoke on the subject ""A Rising China : Impact on the Emerging World Order"". He made the following important points in his 30 minutes address: 
  The rise of China and India is in actuality a return to what was existing a few centuries back, when these countries were powerful players in Asia and on the world stage. 
  Great powers are automatically major powers within their region. Capacity of China and India in this respect has grown. 
  Regional powers must also exert influence in other areas and regions. That is why China appears to be contesting India in South Asia. 
  It is to the credit of China that in just two generations, it has transformed itself into an important economic power. 
  The two Plenary Sessions held during the day were chaired by Shri Ajai Vikram Singh, former Defence Secretary and the well known security analyst Air Commodore Jasjit Singh. Seven analysts had made presentations, of which two were from abroad. These were Mr Masahiro Akiyama from Japan and Lt Col Osman Aytac from Turkey. 
  At the end of the Seminar, the Army Chief, General JJ Singh delivered the valedictory address, in which he stressed that globalisation had emerged as a powerful driver in shaping a new world order. He also reminded the audience that non-military factors were equally important in shaping of a new world order. These include the availability of energy resources or lack of them; a holistic view of our environment and how to conserve the depleting natural resources; demographic changes and the harnessing of younger elements of the population, especially in developing countries; economic factors; poverty alleviation measures in developing countries; good governance and a host of social and cultural factors, besides the security and economic factors. 
  While addressing the issue of terrorism Gen Singh stated that India's approach to tackling terrorism was markedly different from that of Western nations. He also stated that fighting terrorism needed a collective approach as approaching it in a compartmentalized fashion would not achieve desired success. He emphasised the need for an approach to tackle terrorism, which was humane yet firm. This was best exemplified by the prevailing concept of the Indian Army, ""iron fist in a velvet glove"". 
  The Seminar was organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS) on behalf of the Indian Army in which the following countries sent their delegates: 
  Asia Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Japan, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Saudi, Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan. 
  Africa Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. 
  America Brazil, Chile and USA.

"6842",20081144,"Title: China Condemns Tibetan Protests.rtf; Date: March 17, 2008 Monday 6:57 PM GMT; Text: China accused Tibetan supporters of the Dalai Lama of attacking its embassies around the world, vowing Monday to protect its territory in the central government's first comments on violent protests against Chinese rule of Tibet.
The statement came as more clashes erupted in other Chinese provinces and a midnight deadline passed for protesters in Tibet's capital to surrender or face harsh consequences. Residents of Lhasa feared a military sweep after midnight, the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet said.
""The Chinese government will unwaveringly protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.
Protests that began in Tibet have spilled over to neighboring provinces and even to the capital, Beijing, where students staged a sit-down demonstration Monday. There have been sympathy protests around the world as well, many of them outside Chinese diplomatic missions.
""Tibetan independence forces used violent acts to break through police cordons in foreign countries and break into Chinese embassies and consulates,"" Liu said. He called on international governments to increase security at its missions.
He said the ""atrocities of the Tibetan independence forces manifested ... the hypocrisy and deceit of its peace and non-violence propaganda,"" a reference to supporters of the Dalai Lama.
The fiercest anti-China protests in Tibet in almost two decades have attracted more international scrutiny of the communist government's human rights record in the run-up to the Beijing Summer Olympics, which China had hoped would boost its image in the world.
Britain's Cabinet minister for Asian affairs warned that tough handling of the unrest in Tibet could undermine China's efforts.
""This is a China engaged with the world which is using the Olympics to demonstrate a new openness, and it risks all of that collapsing in on it if it is seen as being the enforcer of a crackdown on Tibetans,"" Mark Malloch-Brown told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
In London, around 80 protesters held a raucous rally outside the Chinese Embassy and some hurled placards and sticks at the building while trying unsuccessfuly to force their way in.
""We want China to hold true to the ideals of the Olympics with freedom of speech, freedom of expression and media access,"" said Phurbu Rinzin, one of six Tibetan students from British universities who planned to hold a 24-hour hunger strike outside the embassy.
German police detained 26 Tibetans when they tried to break into the Chinese consulate in Munich. The protesters tore down a Chinese flag and spray-painted ""Save Tibet"" and ""Stop Killing"" on the building.
In the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, police used bamboo batons to chase off some 100 Tibetan protesters and Buddhist monks protesting against China. Police in India's capital clashed with nearly 100 pro-Tibet protesters who tried to get to China's embassy.
Tibet's China-appointed governor, Champa Phuntsok, denounced the protesters in Lhasa as criminals and threatened harsh consequences for those who did not turn themselves in by midnight Monday. Tibet's legal authorities issued the surrender deadline Saturday.
""If these people turn themselves in, they will be treated with leniency within the framework of the law,"" said Champa Phuntsok, an ethnic Tibetan. Otherwise ""we will deal with them harshly,"" he added.
He said those who turned themselves in and informed on others would earn even more leniency.
""No country would allow those offenders or criminals to escape the arm of justice and China is no exception,"" Champa Phuntsok said at news briefing.
Champa Phuntsok said he did not know if anyone had surrendered and police and government officials in Lhasa refused to comment.
The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, said Sunday that he felt ""helpless"" in the face of the Chinese ultimatum for protesters to surrender.
""I feel very sad, very serious, very anxious. Cannot do anything,"" the Nobel Peace laureate told reporters at the headquarters of Tibet's government-in-exile in India.
The unrest in Tibet began March 10 on the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule that sent the Dalai Lama and much of the leading Buddhist clergy into exile. Tibet was effectively independent for decades before Chinese communist troops entered in 1950.
Largely peaceful protests by monks spiraled into violence Friday, with Tibetans attacking Chinese and burning their businesses in Lhasa. The outburst came after several years of intensifying government control over Buddhist practices and vilification of the Dalai Lama, whom Tibetans still revere.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated on Monday her call for China to show restraint in fighting the protests and urged Beijing to find a way to work with the Dalai Lama.
""There's been a kind of missed opportunity for the Chinese to engage the Dalai Lama,"" Rice told reporters Monday. She said the Dalai Lama is a voic"
"206",20033321,"Title: School_ Books, 2 takes; SPECIAL EDITION.rtf; Date: July 21, 2003, Monday, BC cycle; Text: You know you shouldn't let your kid carry an entire library in his backpack - just the texts he uses for the day. But a nice book shelf in his study area can help him build pride in his collection of titles. Here are some starters:
- The 50th anniversary of the successful ascent of Mount Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 has inspired several new books, among them Audrey Salkeld's ""Climbing Everest"" (National Geographic, $ 21 hardcover). Salkeld, who has twice made a partial ascent of the mountain (once from the Tibetan side, once from the Nepalese side), writes not only about the victory of Hillary and Norgay but about the tragedies of others who tried to conquer the mountain - notably George Mallory, who with his mountaineer colleague Andrew Irvine disappeared during a 1924 expedition, and eight others who died during a 1996 expedition.
- It's also the centenary year for two other adventurers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who engineered the first successful airplane flight in 1903. ""The Wright Brothers for Kids: How They Invented the Airplane"" (Chicago Review Press, $ 14.95 paperback), by Mary Kay Carson, retells the history and suggests experiments youngsters can do to demonstrate the principles of flight. ""Airborne: A Photobiography of Wilbur and Orville Wright"" (National Geographic, $ 19.95 hardcover), by Mary Collins, recaptures some of the excitement of the brothers' achievement, including pictures of subsequent demonstration flights by Wilbur Wright over New York City and French farmland in 1909.
- The same publishers offer similar books about Revolutionary days. ""The American Revolution for Kids"" (Chicago Review Press, $ 14.95 paperback), by Janis Herbert, guides younger readers through the issues, events and personalities of the war for independence. One of those characters is profiled in a picture book by writer-artist Cheryl Harness in ""The Revolutionary John Adams"" (National Geographic, $ 17.95 hardcover).
- For young history buffs, there's ""Children's Encyclopedia of American History"" (DK Publishing-Smithsonian Institution, $ 29.99 hardcover), by David C. King. The book starts with the first known European exploration by Leif Eriksson around 1000 and moves chronologically through American history to the current era of 9-11 terrorism and the wars in the wake of the attacks. The book also includes an appendix with a listing of all U.S. presidents, states of the union, and texts of the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and its Amendments, and the Gettysburg Address.
- ""Mayflower 1620: A New Look at a Pilgrim Voyage"" (National Geographic, $ 17.95 hardcover) is a photographic re-enactment of the voyage that brought the first colonists to the U.S. Northeast. The photographs are of Mayflower II, the reproduction ship whose home berth is at Plimoth Plantation at Plymouth, Mass., near where the original colonists landed. The book was produced by among others, sailor and marine artisan Peter Arenstam; John Kemp, associate director of colonial interpretation at Plimoth; writer Catherine O'Neill; and photographer Sisse Brimberg. The book's primary message is that the colonists came for a variety of reasons besides religious freedom; some did, but others were looking for land, resources, new opportunities and lives.
- But what of the people already on the land? Who were they and where did they come from? ""Who Came First? New Clues to Prehistoric Americans"" (National Geographic, $ 18.95 hardcover), by Patricia Lauber, assesses the evidence, which suggests that tribes inhabited the Americas for thousands of years before the Europeans arrived. Some may have come from Siberia, traveling overland from northern Asia, others may have come by sea, from southern Asia. To date there are no firm answers, but scientists are gathering tantalizing clues, many of them summarized here.
- Hana Brady, a Jewish girl, was never a famous person, but her story has come to be told by a fortuitous event. Her suitcase - an artifact from the Auschwitz concentration camp - was donated to the Holocaust Education Center in Tokyo. Young visitors urged the curator, Fumiko Ishioka, to find out more about the owner, whose name, birthdate and the word Waisenkind (German for orphan) was painted on the case. In her search, Ishioka traced Hana's history, from her birthplace in Czechoslovakia, through her family's and her own deportations to concentration camps by the Nazis, her death at Auschwitz, and finally, the discovery of Hana's still-living brother. The dual story of Hana and Ishioka's search for her is told in ""Hana's Suitcase"" (Albert Whitman, $ 15.95 hardcover, with a CD radio dramatization), by Karen Levine. Photos of Hana and her family and Hana's childhood drawings are reproduced in the book.

"1216",20031687,"Title: Everest Conqueror Celebrates 50-Year Mark.rtf; Date: May 6, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Fifty years after conquering Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary is still setting himself lofty goals.
As he prepares to travel to Nepal to mark the anniversary of his momentous climb to the summit of the world's highest peak, Hillary is planning to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help impoverished people living in the Himalayan mountains.
These days, it is those aspirations rather than memories of his historic climb that invigorate the 83-year-old former beekeeper.
""Building schools and hospitals, medical clinics and fresh water pipelines and re-establishing forestry"" were ""the most worthwhile things we have done"" over the past several decades, Hillary said in an interview with The Associated Press.
""I've had a remarkable time, I've had great adventures, I've made extremely good friends … and of course we've been able to be extremely helpful to the Sherpas"" he said, summing up the 50 years since May 29, 1953.
On that day, the 33-year-old New Zealander and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first climbers to reach the 29,035 foot summit of Mt. Everest.
Today, the last obstacle before the domed summit, a 40-foot ice-covered rock face, is called the ""Hillary Step"" in recognition of the triumph.
More than 1,200 people since then have climbed to the peak, and the trail blazed by Hillary and Tenzing is well worn. Officials say at least 180 have died in the process.
This year, a record 1,000 climbers plan assaults on the summit of what the Nepalese call Chomolungma or Mother Goddess of the World. Most will fail to reach the top.
Meanwhile, Hillary and the charitable trust he set up funnels about $400,000 annually into development projects in the Solu Khumbu region of Nepal.
Hillary's trust has built two hospitals, a dozen health clinics, 27 schools, air landing strips, bridges and even restored Buddhist monasteries for the Sherpa people he vowed to aid back in 1953 in return for Tenzing's help in getting him to the roof of the world.
Hillary is looking forward to a ""lively old time at a huge party"" on the 50th anniversary in the Nepalese capital of Katmandu he told the AP from his Auckland home.
At least 100 family and western mountaineering friends and up to 600 Nepalese will attend the May 29 celebratory dinner.
""Time has slipped by but getting all my friends together, both Sherpas and Westerners, will be great fun. There is no question about that,"" he said.
Part of the celebrations will be broadcast live by television back to New Zealand, where Hillary is a national hero.
Within days he will fly to events in London, New York, Washington and San Francisco to raise half a million U.S. dollars for the Himalayan Trust he founded.
Recalling his climb last year, Hillary said he vividly remembers ""many occasions"" when he and Tenzing doubted they would reach the top. Deep ravines and crevasses, avalanches, extreme ice faces and rock walls stood in the way as they struggled upward.
""That's what it's all about really, overcoming those problems even though you may have a sense of fear. I think fear can be a stimulating factor and can help make you drive yourself really to overcome dangerous problems,"" he said.
Everest is not the only challenge he has conquered.
He also has led expeditions to both the North and South Poles and a jet boat adventure up India's River Ganges to its mountain source.
Approaching his 84th birthday in July, Hillary acknowledged, ""I've got to slow down"" and reduce his international fund-raising commitments, but he added: ""how I'm going to do that I don't quite know.""

"4743",20061431,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists threaten more attacks in run-up to elections.rtf; Date: January 16, 2006 Monday 1:50 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebels said Monday they would step up attacks in the run-up to municipal polls next month, after weekend clashes killed at least 12 police around the capital.
The government tightened security in the Kathmandu Valley following the killings and announced a curfew covering more than a million people.
""We urge all to be prepared for our military actions and storm of agitation,"" said Ananta, a Maoist commander, in an emailed statement.
He said an alliance with seven opposition parties who also oppose the February 8 local polls remains in place, despite the death of 45 people since the Maoists ended their unilateral ceasefire two weeks ago.
A late-night curfew has been imposed in Kathmandu and the adjoining city of Patan, authorities said Monday evening.
""A curfew has been imposed inside the ring road from 11 pm to 4 am due to security reasons,"" said Sushil Ghimiri, chief district officer of Kathmandu.
The curfew will be enforced by armed police and the army and they are authorised to shoot people breaking it.
The area where the curfew has been imposed has around 1.4 million residents.
As part of tighter security, troops and police have been mobilized in the valley to undertake strict stop and search operations, state-run Radio Nepal quoted a home ministry statement as saying.
The opposition parties had asked the rebels to shun violence but the Maoist commander said the attacks would continue.
""We reiterate our party's commitment to work in unity with the seven parliamentary parties, civil society and all democratic and leftist forces to end feudal monarchy and establish a democratic republic,"" said Ananta.
""We have given a big slap to the regime of the king, who is trying to gain legitimacy by holding farcical municipal polls. We have begun our mission to strike the enemy's head (urban centers),"" the rebel commander said.
Government officials and election organizers have said the polls would go ahead despite the threats and boycott.
The king sacked the government in February 2005, saying it had failed to stem the decade-long insurgency, and assumed absolute power.
In the face of international calls to restore democracy, he has outlined his own 'road map to peace' under which the municipal elections will be followed by national elections some time before April 2007.
Since the Maoists began their ""people's war"" in 1996 at least 12,000 people have been killed and 100,000 have been displaced.

The rebels kidnapped the junior grade school students in the western Nepalese district of Rukum but released a group of 46 teachers they had kidnapped in southwestern Nepal, police said.
The whereabouts of Rukum's kidnapped students were not known, a police spokesman added.
The students were returning from an inter-school sporting event when they were seized.
The 46 teachers from 13 schools who were freed Friday had been abducted last Sunday in the far southwest of the revolt-wracked kingdom by rebels who forced them to take part in cultural and learning events.
Earlier this month, Maoists seized more than 700 students and teachers in western Achham district, but freed most of them after making them attend anniversary celebrations marking the start of their violent ""people's war"".
Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed more than 9,000 lives.

The Human Rights Organization of Nepal said in a statement that four activists rounded up after the kingdom imposed emergency rule in November 2001 were freed by the Supreme Court after appeals by rights groups and their families.
They were identified as Sagar Bhattarai, Nara Bahadur Shahi, Moti Rijal and Uddhav Acharya. None was considered a senior activist.
But a local radio station said five Maoist suspects had been released and that one of them, Nirmala Dhamala, was promptly rearrested by police.
Home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said he was not aware of the releases.
The Maoist rebels, who have fought for seven years to topple the constitutional monarchy, and the government announced a ceasefire January 29 and are expected to begin peace talks shortly.
The two sides are discussing the release of about 4,000 jailed Maoist supporters, most of them detained when Nepal was under emergency rule from November 2001 to August 2002.
The release of all of them may take time to process, a source close to the Maoists said.
""The list of the Maoist activists imprisoned across the country is being prepared and both the government and the Maoists will check it before they are set free,"" the source said.
The Maoist conflict has left more than 7,800 people dead since 1996, according to army figures.

"4929",2006793,"Title: More than 100 hurt in Nepal clashes.rtf; Date: April 22, 2006 Saturday 5:23 PM GMT; Text: At least 100 people were hurt in clashes Saturday as thousands of Nepalese defied a curfew to march on the capital to reject embattled King Gyanendra's offer to return power to the people.
Twelve were in serious condition with bullet wounds and other injuries, a doctor said, after police fired on thousands of demonstrators in protests near the heavily defended king's palace.
Opposition parties and Maoist rebels dismissed Gyanendra's promise of a return to multi-party democracy and said they would continue protests and demands for a new constitution to decide the monarchy's fate.
The monarch, who had seized power last February, ordered an eight-hour curfew on Saturday after protesters gathered on the outskirts of the city, burning tyres and throwing stones.
An estimated 300,000 protesters converged on the city, according to diplomatic source, with some shouting ""The king's address is a sham"" and ""We want complete democracy"".
They moved towards the centre where they were met by a wall of police who charged them with batons and tear gas, forcing them to turn tail leaving hundreds of shoes on the ground, an AFP reporter witnessed.
Many of the wounded had head injuries, doctor Sarita Pandey of Kathmandu Model Hospital said.
The protests petered out after torrential rain hit the capital and witnesses reported thousands of demonstrators leaving the city centre. The curfew officially ended at 8:00 pm (1415 GMT).
Mobile phones failed to work in the capital from mid-afternoon. No officials from Nepal Telecom were available to comment but cutting off mobile phone service has been a popular regime tactic to hamper protests.
The demonstrations came hours after King Gyanendra late Friday asked Nepal's seven-party opposition to appoint a prime minister in an apparent climbdown.
In his televised speech after tumultuous demonstrations in Kathmandu and sustained international pressure, the king called for ""a meaningful exercise in democracy"" with elections ""as soon as possible"".
But the opposition rejected the offer and vowed to continue protests as strikes and demonstrations entered their 17th day.
""The king in his royal proclamation has failed to address the issues of the seven-party alliance's roadmap and the understanding reached with the Maoists,"" the parties said in a joint statement.
""There is no way we can join the government and our general strike and peaceful protest will continue.""
The alliance wants a constituent assembly to decide the future of the monarch, who sacked the government 14 months ago saying it was corrupt and had failed to stem a bloody Maoist revolt.
The Maoists, who have fought a 10-year insurgency that has left some 12,500 dead, said the ""so-called royal address"" by the king was meaningless.
In a statement, their leader said they would continue to oppose the king, who held out no olive branch to the Maoists in his speech. They are seen as key to any settlement as they control swathes of the country.
The Maoists and their former foes from the opposition parties struck a loose alliance in November to oust the Hindu monarch, who is believed by many in Nepal to be a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, the protector.
Gyanendra's announcement drew cautious praise from the international community, with the United States, the United Nations and Britain welcoming the move as a first step on the path to democracy.
India expressed support on Saturday for Nepal's seven-party opposition political alliance after initially welcoming King Gyanendra's offer.
Britain also advised its citizens Saturday against travelling to Nepal because of a serious risk of being caught up in street violence.
It said there was a ""high probability"" of further violence and disturbances in the coming weeks.
The alliance of opposition parties launched a nationwide general strike on April 6 to force the king to relinquish absolute power.
Gyanendra responded with a security clampdown which left more than a dozen dead, hundreds wounded and even more under arrest.
Hundreds of thousands of people responded to calls to intensify the strike, pouring into the outskirts of Kathmandu on Thursday and Friday before penetrating the city on Saturday despite a curfew.

  In their memorandum to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the children demanded that, a law for free and compulsory primary education, an investment of at least six percent of the GDP on Education, a speedy formation of a National Commission on Elementary Education and a complete ban on child labour.
 The Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) organised the march. 
  ""The Government has no excuse, as over Rs. 5000crore has already been collected from the public through the education cess. Now is the time to spend and not to hold the money as childhood cannot wait for politics and bureaucracy,"" BBA Chairperson Kailash Satyarthi said.
  He further said, ""Governments of developing countries must prioritize spending on education and have concrete plans involving teacher training, building schools, providing text books and uniforms.""
  Several Members of Parliament (MP) also raised their voice in support of a children's education law. 
  ""It is really necessary to have law for free and compulsory education. It is the right of the every single child,"" Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Prada said. 
  Children from Delhi, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir participated in the rally.
 Fourteen year-old Pintu from Jharkhand, who was working in a stone factory, said ""I had been doing all this for my family as there are so many members and I had to earn something for them. Now I am here to fight for our rights and I want that others who are still bound in such activities should come out of this and I want to help them.""
  Fourteen year-old girl Babli from Mangolpuri said that she had been forced to work as a maid in someone's house. She said, ""I did all the house work. They even scolded me and used harsh language, which really pinched a lot,"" she added.
 Now, both have joined the BBA which believes that education is the solution not only for the 60 million child labourers of India but also for the millions of other children whom can easily be trapped into living the dark life of a child labourer, if illiterate. 
  Other organizations including Global March against Child Labour, National Coalition on Education (NCE), All India Primary Teachers Federation (AIPTF), All India Federation of Teachers' Organisations (AIFTO) and All India for Christian Higher Education (AIACHE) also participated in the march. 
  Following their fight for their rights, the Supreme Court had on February 17 issued notices to the Centre and all the State Governments on a petition filed by a BBA to seek framing of guidelines for employing children in circuses.
  According to the BBA General Secretary, R S Chaurasia, working in circuses is termed as a hazardous occupation. Children from backward areas of India and Nepal and especially girl child is employed by the circuses. As per the Child Labour and Prohibition Act, children are not allowed to work late night, but the children working in circuses are made to perform two shows in the night
  The Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 prohibits employment of children in certain hazardous occupations and processes and regulates their employment in some other areas. 
  According to report in 2005, India is home to one in every three illiterate persons in the world. India does best on the enrolment at 82.3 percent ranking 94th but the drop out rates are also very high, around 39.8 percent. Indian children's survival to class V has actually declined marginally to 61.2 percent from 62 percent of the previous year and is way below the global average of 83.3 percent. 
  Nearly 25 percent districts fall under the Low Literacy Districts. Among them, Uttar Pradesh (31) and Bihar (30) are the most illiterate States. Few others are Jharkhand (13), Rajasthan (11), Orissa (10).

Of the 52 children admitted at Wajir district hospital, 39 tested positive for the disease that is also known as visceral leishmaniasis and transmitted by the female sandfly.
""Six children have died. All the cases are from the neighbouring and remote district of Isiolo,"" said regional medical officer Ahmeddin Omar in Wajir, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Nairobi.
""Kala-zaar suppresses the immune system of children. When a child is infected, he can even die of a common cold,"" he said, warning that many more could die since patients could not reach health facilities because of the remoteness of the region.
Omar said the government had sent emergency drugs to the hospital, but they were not enough in the face out mounting infections.
""If we get 10 more admissions, the drugs will not be enough,"" he said, adding that health officials had started spraying homesteads with insecticides in a bid the curb the spread of the infection.
Kala-azar is transmitted by the miniscule sandfly and is fatal if untreated. Its symptoms include irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver and anaemia.
In the past, aid workers have reported outbreaks in southern Sudan, a region trying to emerge from more than two decades of war and where health facilities are still rudimentary.
Last year, the disease killed more than 150 people, many of them children, in northern Ethiopia.
About 500,000 cases of the disease are diagnosed each year, more than 90 percent of them in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sudan as well as Brazil, according to the World Health Organization.

The meeting was drawing together health, agriculture and livestock officials from the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, a government statement said.
Representatives of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization also were expected to attend the daylong discussions.
About 80 million chickens have been slaughtered across Asia, excluding China, to curb the spread of bird flu, which has killed 14 people in Vietnam and six in Thailand. Although there have been no reports of bird flu in South Asia, there have been rising concerns about it spreading to the region.
Most countries in the South Asian grouping - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives - have banned the import of poultry and meat products from several Asian countries.
""The meeting will deliberate on possible cooperation for tackling the problem of avian influenza or bird flu which has emerged in some Asian countries,"" said a statement issued by India's ministry of external affairs.
The meeting was called after the WHO said bird flu could have a more devastating impact on Asia than last year's SARS outbreak, the statement said.
Although no cases of bird flu have been reported in India, prices of chicken have plunged by one-third in New Delhi and several other areas because of panic.
India's poultry industry was losing more than 100 million rupees (US$2.2 million) every day due to a fall in demand for chicken and eggs, the Hindu Business Line newspaper reported Monday.

Text of editorial headlined ""United Nations Mission against the press"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 5 March
We are shocked by the news of the crash of a helicopter of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), which is active in facilitating the peace process in Nepal. Ten personnel, both Nepalese and foreigners, were killed in the crash. The personnel were on their way to monitor the Maoist camp at Bethan of Ramechhap district. The UN mission was invited by Nepal to help in the peace process after the Maoists stopped their 10-year old people's war and signed a peace deal. It has been playing an important role in the peace process in Nepal. We would like to express our hearties condolences on the demise of the personnel, who were on their duty. 
Promptly after the news of the crash of the UNMIN helicopter, our reporters and cameramen had headed to the crash site despite the adverse weather conditions. They had hired a truck to get to the site and sent news and images to the capital. Next day, the UNMIN staffers took the truck into their control and tried to prevent the reporters from covering the news. Later, they let the vehicle go ahead but on condition that they would not capture the visuals of the site. By the time the vehicle reached the crash site, it was already an hour late. 
Everything had changed by the time the reporters reached the site. The UNMIN staffers not only tried to prevent them from taking pictures but also forced to erase the pictures they had taken. We are really saddened to know that the UNMIN staffers tried to chase the reporters away. We had often been informed that UNMIN staffers used to mistreat the journalists while on duty. The UNMIN staffers had mistreated the reporters of these newspapers as well as the cameramen of the government media. This shows that the UNMIN, working for the member nations all over the world, is playing an obstructive role against the press. 
It seems that the UNMIN staffers think that their lives are more valuable than anyone else. The UNMIN staffers are working with world-class security and benefits. The press people in the developing countries take risks to cover such incidents. Their lives are as dear as those of the UNMIN people. The UN staffers should not take the press as an obstruction to their activities. The journalists had not gone there to challenge the freedom of the UN workers. They were there to cover the crash that happened at a public place. By obstructing the journalists, the UNMIN staffers have violated the press freedom. It is not still known whether the UN has the policy of preventing the coverage of the incident of public interest. 
UNMIN is working in Nepal under limited authority and for limited time. If the UNMIN staffers think that Nepal is a failed nation, they are wrong. It should understand its responsibilities and jurisdiction. UNMIN has been found to have violated the rules in Nepal. It has used only English numbers in its vehicles and has crossed the boundary of conducting general monitoring works. It has launched radio programmes, for example. The mission should fulfil its duty without trying to create a parallel state of its own. The mission should take action against the staffers who mistreated the journalists and should make its position clear about the press.

The prime minister, at a meeting with the leaders at his official residence at Baluwatar Thursday evening, officially informed Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and NC parliamentary party leader Ram Chandra Paudel about his proposal on advancing the peace process and forming a national consensus government.
He had made public the same proposal in a public appeal on Monday. He formally told the two leaders that he would step down on August 13 if there is no tangible progress in the peace process by then.
""Basically, the prime minister explained his proposal in detail. His emphasis was that there is no way except to expedite the peace process and move ahead through consensus with regard to forming the next government as well,"" the prime minister's press advisor, Surya Thapa, told Republica.
According to Thapa, both Dahal and Paudel gave a positive nod to the prime minister's ideas and agreed to hold the next round of talks promptly. The top leaders then decided to bring along to their next meeting their second-rung leaders, who are working closely on issues related to the peace process.
""It indicates that the leaders are positive toward the prime minister's proposal and this time they have realized the urgency of it,"" claimed Thapa.
Sources at Baluwatar said talks on the peace process will move forward this time as Minister Ghanshyam Bhusal has done much of the spade work through several rounds of informal talks with top and second-rung leaders from the three major parties in the last 45 days or so, over the same proposal that the prime minister put to the leaders on Thursday.
In the proposal floated to the two leaders, Khanal said he can't stay on in office if some major issues on the peace process aren't settled by August 13.
Khanal has said that the number of Maoist combatants to be integrated into the security agencies should be fixed, the modality and norms for integration and rank harmonization finalized and the rehabilitation package for former rebels also finalized by that time. He has said completion of the aforementioned tasks would create an environment for immediately starting the categorization of Maoist combatants based on their choice between joining government security agencies or rehabilitation in society. The prime minister is for completing the task of categorization by August 31 when the twice-renewed term of the Constituent Assembly (CA) ends.
The prime minister, in his proposal, also put forth the idea of heading the new governments on rotational basis among the three major parties.
According to his proposal, either the UCPN (Maoist), the largest party in parliament, or the second largest NC can lead the next consensus government that will promulgate the new constitution by November 30, and the government to be formed after that will accomplish the remaining tasks of state restructuring within a period of six to nine months.
Similarly, the third government to be formed after that would conduct the election to the House of Representatives within a period of six to nine months.
Minister Bhusal said the talks with other political parties were positive. ""The response we have received informally from both Maoist and NC leaders for the most part after the prime minister made his statement public Monday has instilled more optimism in me,"" Bhusal told Republica. ""However, they have said they would give their institutional response only after the formal talks take place. And now it has begun."" Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

[by Rajendra Phuyal]
Kathmandu, [Thursday] 15 February: Security guards of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist legislators of the interim legislature-parliament on Thursday were found to be carrying weapons while entering parliament.
Two security guards of two legislators were carrying a set of weapon each and were found by the police during routine security check.
Security guards of Maoist legislators Dev Gurung and Lokendra Bista were carrying the arms, which were confiscated by the police but just for a while, later to be handed back to them only after an understanding was reached between the CPN-M and the Ministry of Home Affairs.
According to some parliamentarians, the Maoist lawmakers entered parliament with their armed security guards. The security guard of legislator Dev Gurung entered the parliament building from the southern gate while Bista's guard entered through the eastern gate.
Immediately after Gurung and Bista made their entry to the house, the lawmakers surrounded the office of the speaker of the interim legislature-parliament, Subash Nemwang, and drew his attention towards the incident. They also sought a clarification from Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula over the incident.
On his part, the home minister told the legislators that the government had taken the incident ""very seriously"".
The Maoist guards were reported to have been carrying Chinese pistols with them.
The CPN-M has 83 members in the 330-member interim legislature-parliament. As per agreement reached between the seven-party alliance government and the Maoists, the latter had agreed to lock their arms up in seven different cantonments, the processes for which are under way in the presence of UN monitoring team.

The attack took place in hilly terrain in Rohtas district, 125 miles west of Patna, the capital of the eastern Indian state of Bihar, said Ritu Raj, the deputy inspector-general of police.
Raj said militants of the outlawed Maoist Communist Center were suspected in the attack since the area is their stronghold. Other details were not immediately available.
The rebels work closely with the People's War Group, another guerrilla group, and are active in five southern and eastern states. They are also suspected of having close links with Nepal's communist rebels.
More than 6,000 people have been killed since the rebels, inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1981. The insurgents mostly target rich landowners and police.

Eleven rebels and four students were killed, the army said.
Five students also were injured in the violence Monday in the remote mountain village of Mutuhara, about 600 kilometer (375 miles) northeast of the capital, Katmandu.
An army official at the regional headquarters in Nepalgunj said that the students were killed and injured by a grenade set off by the rebels during the fighting. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said soldiers stormed the building after hearing that the rebels had taken control of it.
Dambari Dika, 17, who was injured in the fighting, said the rebels entered the school and forced the students to gather in an assembly hall. The insurgents were planning to give a lecture there when soldiers stormed the building, she said.
""We were all scared. We told the rebels not to come inside the school but they refused,"" Dika told The Associated Press from a hospital in Nepalgunj, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of Katmandu.
Dika said students were frightened and confused when the soldiers stormed the building, and that she did not know who killed her classmates. She took cover behind a desk, but was shot in the leg.
Her 13-year-old sister Meena died.
The battle between the soldiers and the rebels lasted for at least four hours. There were no casualties on the army side, the army official said.
The injured students were flown to the hospital on army helicopters and were receiving treatment. Doctors at the hospital said they were in stable condition.
Fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated since last week when a nine-day cease-fire imposed by the rebels during the Hindu Dasain festival expired.
Nearly 400 people have died since the rebels pulled out of peace talks and a seven-month cease-fire in August.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a communist state. The government has labeled them terrorists.
More than 7,400 people have been killed since the insurgency began.
Meanwhile, suspected rebels fatally shot a government employee in Katmandu on Tuesday.
The man, identified as Anil Chaudhari, worked at the Central Wool and Carpet Development Board. He was shot by two assailants police believe to be members of the rebel group. Chaudhari was driving toward a parking lot when he was shot.

  The date is expected to be decided after due consideration is given to the management of arms and armies, Kantipur reported.
  The meeting is scheduled to be held at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's residence at Baluwatar. SPA-Maoist leaders are also expected to discuss a proposal to revise the draft of the statute.
  Koirala and Maoist Chairman Prachanda on Sunday had decided to hold an all-party meeting along with the Maoists on the subject.
  Last week, Prachanda had warned of street protests if the interim statute was not issued by the agreed date. He claimed that the SPA Government had agreed to issue the Interim Constitution by January 14.
  Meanwhile, the country's Supreme Court justices have unanimously decided to ask the parties to amend the judicial provisions in the proposed Interim Constitution to ensure judicial independence. 
  The apex-policy making body of Nepal's judiciary, the full court, outlined 13-point suggestions to amend the judicial provisions, which include the appointment of the chief justice, impeachment, formation of the Constitutional Council and the Judicial Council.

King Gyanendra formally appointed Girija Prasad Koirala, 84, as premier late Thursday as he handed control to political parties following weeks of protests against 14 months of personal rule.
Maoist rebel forces, who have fought a decade-long insurgency, announced a three-month ceasefire Thursday to give the political parties a chance to bring calm to the troubled Himalayan kingdom.
The parliament was dissolved four years ago and Gyanendra seized absolute power for himself in February 2005, blaming the failure of the government to quell the Maoist revolt.
But on Monday, Gyanendra agreed in a televised address to reinstate parliament, buckling after 19 days of protests on the streets of the capital.
He went on to ask the opposition to choose a new prime minister while crowds flooded the streets -- claiming a ""people's victory"" in their struggle against the king -- and the capital Kathmandu began to return to normal.
""His Majesty (the) King has appointed Girija Prasad Koirala as the new premier upon recommendation from the seven agitating political parties,"" a statement from the royal palace said.
Koirala, the president of the opposition Nepal Congress had been due to address crowds on Thursday in the capital, but missed the celebratory gathering due to ill health.
""Our leader is suffering from bronchitis and he could not attend today's rally,"" Nepali Congress spokesman Krishna Prasad Sitaula told AFP.
There were conflicting reports about whether he would be able to attend Friday's session of parliament -- the first since it was dissolved by King Gyanendra in May 2002.
The Maoist rebels at first rejected the king's offer to reconvene parliament after weeks of street protests, saying it did not go far enough after nearly 15 months of his absolute rule.
But in a statement early Thursday, leader Prachanda said the rebels would halt offensive operations after a decade of fighting that has left more than 12,500 dead.
""Our party once again declares a unilateral ceasefire, effective immediately, for three months,"" said Prachanda.
The rebel army would stop attacking security services, but would remain in ""active defense position,"" said a statement from the Maoist leader.
He said the move was designed to ""motivate"" political leaders to call elections for a constituent assembly, tasked with re-drafting the constitution.
All this was greeted euphorically in Kathmandu as a series of political leaders gave speeches to a rapturous reception from crowds waving party flags and signs warning politicians they were being closely observed by the public.
""Do not repeat the past. Take the oath from the sovereign Nepalese, not the killer Gyanendra,"" said one banner.
However analysts predicted months of continued wrangling and potential instability to come. The king's future role in Nepal remains unclear.
Maoists were expected to hold their first meeting in the capital for three years on Friday to coincide with the opening of parliament.
The rebels want a new constitution to end the monarch's tight grip over the armed forces and political life in the troubled Himalayan nation.
Some 200 of the 205 members sitting in 2002, when parliament was dissolved after a political row over the king's power, were expected to attend, local media said.
The opposition promised that among the first issues to be discussed would be constituent assembly elections in a bid to satisfy the Maoists and try to encourage them to join the political process.
The Maoists lifted a blockade of the capital on Wednesday following a plea by Koirala, but said they would reimpose it if the political leaders failed to meet their core demand for a constituent assembly.

""A number of human rights defenders, including journalists, lawyers, NHRC (National Human Rights Commission) staff and local human rights activists, have faced increasing harassment"" from security forces and Maoists, the joint statement by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists said.
""Human rights defenders have been killed, detained under anti-terrorist legislation, abducted, tortured and threatened, and offices of human rights organisations have been raided,"" the groups said.
Human rights defenders in Nepal play a vital role in protecting people against ""appalling abuses"" by security forces and the rebels, said Ingrid Massage, Asia Director at Amnesty International. 
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and install a communist republic in the poverty-stricken nation in a conflict that has claimed some 11,000 lives.
The groups noted the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances received ""more reports of disappearance cases than from any other country in the world"" when it visited Nepal this month.
A European delegation -- the EU Troika led by the Netherlands -- which also has just visited Nepal, noted a ""rapidly deteriorating human rights situation.""
Following a visit in November, the International Commission of Jurists also called for urgent steps to ""halt Nepal's spiraling descent into lawlessness,"" the statement said.
The groups called on the United Nations to give Nepal's National Human Rights Commission ""its backing at the highest level to monitor and call both parties to account.""
Some 11,000 people have died in the conflict. But violence spiralled in the kingdom over the past week with security forces reporting the deaths of around 100 people, mostly rebels, but also nearly two dozen troops.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has given the rebels until January 13 to come back to the negotiating table to discuss ending the conflict, saying that otherwise he will begin preparing for long-awaited national elections.
Nepal has not had an elected parliament for about two years.
The guerrillas have already rejected the government's deadline for talks and analysts say it will be difficult to stage elections as the Maoists dominate large areas of the country and have threatened to sabotage the polls.
Analysts say the escalation of violence by the Maoists is aimed at piling pressure on the government to agree to their demand for polls to be held for a constituent assembly to determine Nepal's political future.

 Text of report by Indian Doordarshan DDTV news channel on 10 May
 [Newsreader] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said it was incumbent on all to ensure that institutions of democratic framework were respected and nothing was done to weaken the democratic fabric. Talking to journalists on way back home from his three-day visit to Russia, he said the Election Commission is a constitutional body which played a critical and positive role in the successful functioning of democracy in the country.
 [Correspondent Snehasis Sur] The prime minister today called upon to uphold the sanctity of the Election Commission [sentence as heard]. Talking to newspersons on board while returning from Moscow, Dr Manmohan Singh commented on the controversy regarding the conduct of the election commissioners during the last Lok Sabha [lower house] election in Bihar.
Doordarshan DDTV news channel, New Delhi, in English 15:00 GMT, 10 May 05
[Manmohan Singh] It is important that the entire nation understands the importance of constitutional institutions such as the Election Commission for their contribution to earning India the respect and admiration of the world. It is incumbent on all to ensure that the essential institutions of a democratic framework are respected, their sanctity maintained, and their autonomy preserved in a manner which will ensure that they continue to contribute to our democratic life. This responsibility vests both in those working within the institutions and also in those outside. It is in this perspective that all issues should be examined. Nothing should be done which can lead to an unwanted weakening of our democratic institutional fabric.
 [Sur] Prime minister also indicated that India has to resume supply of arms to Nepal.
 [Manmohan Singh] Nepal is our closest neighbour. What happens there, it has implications for us. So this question has been kept under constant review. So, I think whatever is in the pipeline, we cannot hold it back for a long time.
 [Sur] Commenting on the ongoing boycott of the parliament by the NDA [National Democratic Alliance], prime minister once again expressed his disappointment and he reiterated that he is ready to discuss any issue on the floor of the House.
 [Manmohan Singh] I think the NDA has been out of power, but they are still not reconciling to the fact that they are out of power. And I have repeatedly said that all issues we are willing to discuss [word indistinct] on the floor of both houses - whether it is tainted ministers, whether any other area.
 [Sur] On the occasion of the one year of the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government indicating its priorities in future, the prime minister reiterated that in the changed global system, new possibilities are emerging to make India a power house.
 [Manmohan Singh] (?Economic) poverty does not have to be the inevitable (?lot) of human beings. And there are today possibilities - technological possibility and also the evolution of the global political system creates new opportunities for us to leapfrog in the race for social and economic change. So my foremost concern is to make India a major power house.
 [Sur] Snehasis Sur on board Air India-I from Moscow to Delhi.
 [Newsreader] And upon arrival in Delhi, the prime minister also expressed satisfaction over his Moscow visit.
 [Singh] I have just come back after attending the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazism and fascism. And within this (?period), I had a thorough review of our bilateral relations with President Putin and I am glad to report that these relations are in a very fine shape. Our president will be visiting Russia later this month and this will be followed by my own visit later in the year. I have also had useful talks with the president of the United States, President Bush; president of France; and president of China; prime minister of Japan; prime minister of Turkey; prime minister of Czechoslovakia [as heard]. On the whole, this was a very useful visit. It gave me an opportunity to meet many heads of state and heads of government for the first time and these are countries of great importance to us.
 [Newsreader] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also said the government was continuously monitoring the situation in Nepal. He reiterated that India had been advising Kathmandu to restart the political process and outline a road map to bring back democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
 Meanwhile, after a three-month gap, India has announced partial resumption of defence supplies to Nepal. India also expressed hoped that further and early steps would be taken towards the restoration of multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy in that country.

The Private and Boarding Schools' Organization of Nepal (PABSON) and the National Private and Boarding Schools' Association of Nepal (NPABSAN) on Sunday announced the nationwide closure of private schools, following a deadlock in their talks with the striking student unions.
""We have been compelled to close all the private schools across the country indefinitely from Monday since the student unions terrorized us with threats and donation demands,"" state-run English daily The Rising Nepal quoted the statement as saying.
The schools were disturbed for about 27 days after the new academic year began in April, and the student unions have locked more than 200 schools' offices and account sections since last week throughout the country, the statement said.
The agitating students refused to open the locks after the government said it was unable to fulfill one of their 68-point demand aimed at exempting all the fees in public schools, at a tripartite meeting held on Friday among the Nepali Education Ministry, the private and boarding school organizations and the student unions.
More than 8,000 private schools that educate about 1.5 million students across the country are facing the indefinite closure.

"6465",20081232,"Title: Nepal seeks UN mission's term extension by six months.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: December 14, 2008 Sunday
Text of editorial headlined ""Need of UN mission in Nepal"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 14 December
The government has submitted its proposal before the UN seeking to extend the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) term by another six months. Nepal's permanent UN Representative Madhuraman Acharya handed over the government's letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The UNMIN term is expiring on 23 January 2009. The mission came in Nepal on 23 January 2007 and completes one year of its peace mediation. Initially, its term was six months, but since the peace process was not complete, it was extended by six years. 
Is the role of the UN in the peace process of Nepal over? Or should the mission's term be extended until the peace process comes to a logical end? At a time when the international community is not clear on these questions, the government has made its position apparent. During the UN secretary-general's visit some time ago, Nepal government had informally requested for the term extension. UN secretary general's representative in Nepal and UNMIN chief Ian Martin had consulted Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and other political party leaders about the extension. He also held consultations with the opposition Nepali Congress [NC] party, which is critical of UNMIN's role. But the government forwarded the proposal before the NC made public its stand on UNMIN's future role in the country. In one year, UNMIN has completed the tasks of Constituent Assembly [CA] election monitoring, ceasefire monitoring and the Maoist fighters' verification, which was the mandate given to the mission. As the Maoist party has already joined the government, the truce issue is not relevant anymore. The CA election was held successfully, and the verification of the Maoist fighters living in seven camps and 21 satellite camps in different parts of the country, has come to an end. The verifications done in two different phases, found that a total of 19,692 combatants were qualified. But the UNMIN still has some work to complete in Nepal. No concrete steps have been taken to integrate Maoist fighters and manage the weapons. About 2855 weapons of the Nepal Army and 3,444 weapons of the Maoists have been put in containers under the UN mission's supervision. The peace process will not be complete till the weapons of the combatants are handed over to the state, and they are integrated, rehabilitated and managed. 
Writing of the new constitution by the CA and army integration are full of challenges and complexities. The UN mission can provide Nepal with technical assistance for these tasks, especially the army integration. Other countries are willing to give their support in this regard but the UNMIN role will be politically and diplomatically more balanced and appropriate. It is probably for this reason that the government has sought the UN mission's term extension. This is a right move.

The United Nations and charity Oxfam said millions of dollars in aid were needed to get relief supplies to some of the 28 million people displaced across India, Bangladesh and Nepal by the worst monsoon-triggered flooding in decades.
In Dhaka, the authorities were facing outbreaks of water-borne diseases as floodwaters fell and the local death toll climbed to 328 people, officials said Wednesday.
At least 18,300 people suffering from diarrhoea have been admitted to hospitals across Bangladesh in the past eight days due to a shortage of  drinking water, health spokesman Aisha Akhter said.
There have also been outbreaks of respiratory, skin and eye diseases over the past week, said Akhter, noting reports of more than 4,000 new cases of water-borne diseases in the past 24 hours.
""The situation is very acute and alarming,"" said Shahadat Hossain, a doctor at the country's largest diarrhoea hospital in the capital, Dhaka.
The government said it had mobilised thousands of medical workers and distributed millions of water purification tablets.
Bangladesh's flood monitoring agency said inundated areas were still suffering acute shortages of food even as officials said 8,000 tonnes of food had been distributed since late July.
The military-backed government has appealed to political parties, wealthy citizens and foreign countries to help rush food supplies to nine million flood victims.
In India's Bihar state, some 12 million people have seen their homes and farmland partially or totally submerged after the worst flooding in 30 years.
Health experts also voiced fears of disease and the main hospital in state capital Patna reported scores of patients turning up with symptoms of waterborne viruses such as hepatitis.
""People are being treated wherever they can lie down and frankly we don't know what we will do as more are being brought in everyday,"" a hospital spokesman told AFP.
Bihar's chief relief coordinator, R.K. Singh, said distribution of safe drinking water to marooned populations was proving to be an Herculean task.
""In 70 percent of cases water pouches burst on impact after being air-dropped and so we will now consider putting plastic water bottles in the food packets that are dropped by helicopters,"" he said.
India's ruling Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi and home minister Shivraj Patil visited Bihar on Tuesday to assess losses from the floods that inundated 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) of farmland.
The state asked the government for two million tonnes of wheat and rice to feed its flood-affected population, including two million people still living in the open.
""We have seen for ourselves the massive destruction caused by the floods and the centre (national government) will do everything to mitigate the sufferings of the masses,"" Patil told reporters.
National authorities have put the estimated losses to the state at about 38 million dollars.
Huge swathes of Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Assam states were also submerged during the rains, affecting another 6.5 million people.
Assam relief minister Bhumidhar Barman told AFP the situation had greatly improved in the northeastern state, where 870,000 hectares were submerged and 9,291 homes destroyed.
India's national disaster management agency said 1,428 people had died of monsoon-related causes from the start of the season in June to Tuesday. But the figure did not include deaths from numerous boat accidents in Bihar late Monday, bringing the toll to around 1,500.
In Nepal, at least 95 people have died since the monsoon began at the start of June, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 330,000 people have been affected, mostly in the southern plains bordering Bihar.

The strikes occurred three minutes apart and took place in the Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan tribal region - the main sanctuary for al-Qaida and Taliban fighters along the Afghan border, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
There were conflicting reports about exactly how many suspected militants were killed.
One set of Pakistani intelligence officials said 25 people died in the strikes, while another put the number at 34.
The militants were allied with Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a powerful Pakistani Taliban commander in the area who has focused his efforts on fighting foreign troops in Afghanistan, said the officials.
The United States began firing missiles at militant targets in Pakistan in 2004, but the pace of the attacks picked up dramatically in 2008.
Last year, there were around 120 strikes, which are believed to be carried out by unmanned drone aircraft launched either from Afghanistan or from inside Pakistan. There have been around 20 so far this year.
Most of the strikes this year and last have been in North Waziristan.
Washington does not acknowledge firing the missiles and reporters are barred from visiting the area, meaning it is hard to verify who is being killed. Pakistani leaders formally protest the strikes, but its intelligence agencies are widely believed to cooperate in some of them. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

  The Delhi Police's special cell registered a fresh FIR against the two under section 3 of MCOCA, which deals specifically with organised crime syndicates, on December 31. The police will now move court to seek production warrants against the two gangsters, who are now in judicial custody. A senior police officer said the duo will be jointly interrogated to elicit more information about their gang members and activities. Srivastava, who fled from India to Dubai and from there to Singapore, was deported back to the country in 1995. The special cell arrested Fazlu in August last year from the Indo-Nepal border while he was crossing over to the Indian side.
  The FIR states that the two, involved in 40 cases each, including those of murder and kidnapping, have been running organised crime syndicates. Srivastava, the FIR says, has been running his gang from a UP prison since he got back to India. Fazlu and his associates carried some of the most high-profile kidnappings in the country in the late 90's on Srivastava's directions. The two came into contact in 1995 when Fazlu, then in Tihar jail, got to know members of the Babloo Srivastava gang.
  In 1997, Fazlu's gang identified six people for kidnapping. Investigations revealed that the brain behind the operation was Srivastava, who coordinated every move from inside his prison cell. In 1998, on Srivastava's instructions, Fazlu went to Dubai after Irfan Goga was killed in Dubai. There, he took charge of the gang and coordinated with Srivastava.

The royal commission was formed by the king mid-February after the royal takeover on 1st February. More than 50 legal professionals have volunteered to presenting their arguments [those who oppose the body], while about 30 lawyers will be speaking on behalf of the commission.
 Hearings on the royal commission's legality are scheduled to continue on Thursday. Meanwhile, the former minister Rajiv Parajuli, who was arrested on charges of corruption two weeks ago by the Royal Commission for Corruption Control, was released following a Supreme Court order. Parajuli was released with the president of the Nepal Bar Association, Shambu Thapa, as guarantor.

The police quoted the Tibetans as saying they were heading to Kathmandu on the way to the Indian town of Dharmashala, where the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama is based.
Every year several thousand Tibetans flee their homeland, entering Nepal through the snowy Himalayan passes en route to India.
Last month Chinese border guards opened fire at a caravan of Tibetans crossing over to Nepal, killing at least two of them including a Buddhist nun.
The killings drew worldwide condemnation.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 20 September
Biratnagar [town in eastern Nepal], 19 September: Chairman of the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party [RPP], Pashupati Shumsher Rana, said that his party will launch street movement against the government, the seven parties and the Maoists. He said this while addressing a gathering of party workers at Biratnagar on Tuesday [19 September].
Chairman Rana said that the government, after the cease-fire has remained a mute spectator when there is growing strife in the country. ""The government has remained a mute spectator when the Maoists have been violating the cease-fire code of conduct,"" he said. Rana said all the three forces are working to push the country towards further chaos. Rana warned that a large number of people are actively opposed to the three forces and said, ""RPP will lead these people.""
Chairman Rana said that the strife that was confined to the villages is becoming urban-centred after cease-fire by the Maoists. He said the Maoist strife is now making its way to the cities through arches erected in welcome. ""So many things are happening and there is no force trying to control the situation, so the RPP is forced to take to the streets against this state of affairs,"" he said.
He, however, said that RPP's stance on constituent assembly elections will remain unchanged even if the party launches a movement.

"6606",20082375,"Title: Maoist fighters vote for 'new Nepal ' and uncertain fate.rtf; Date: April 10, 2008 Thursday 9:01 AM GMT; Text: Maoist fighters in Nepal were Thursday voting in an election aimed at bringing the country into a new era of peace -- and putting them out of their jobs as hardened revolutionaries.
Still dressed in combat fatigues but confined to camp as part of their ceasefire, members of one of the world's grittiest guerrilla forces said they were nevertheless optimistic that their struggle was coming to an end.
""Ten years of fighting in our People's War was just to bring us to this moment. The new constitution will take our poor country forward by 25 years,"" said beaming rebel commander Bibidh.
""Tomorrow, this country will be ours,"" said the top rebel in Shaktikhor camp, one of several sites where the Maoists, who have about 20,000 fighters, are being watched by the United Nations while the peace process plays out. 
Shaktikhor, situated in Nepal's central Chitwan district and 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the capital, is home to 2,600 rebels.
Thursday's elections are a landmark for the impoverished country, still struggling to emerge on the other side of a decade-long civil war that left at least 13,000 people dead.
The polls will appoint a new body that will rewrite the constitution and likely abolish the monarchy -- a longstanding demand of the rebels.
As polls opened, a steady stream of rebels snaked to the voting centre next to their tidy cantonment of wooden houses with corrugated tin roofs.
""We will do well unless the election workers and observers rig the elections,"" said deputy brigade commander Kanchan, aged 36 and a fighter for the past 10 years.
The Maoists' leader, Prachanda, has said he will respect the vote -- but has threatened mass protests if there is any sniff of rigging.
""There are still a lot of achievements to be made. We want the basic needs of the people to be met -- a home, food, education, jobs,"" Kanchan said.
But a more immediate concern is what will happen to trained and indoctrinated soldiers such as Kanchan now that the war is over.
The political parties and the former rebels were brought together by common opposition to Nepal's autocratic King Gyanendra, who sacked the government in 2005, blaming it for being unable to vanquish the Maoists.
Widespread protests forced him to cede power a year later, and the Maoists and mainstream parties went on to sign a peace accord in November 2006 that saw the Maoists lay down their arms.
Early into the peace process the Maoists called for their soldiers to be integrated into the 90,000-strong Nepal Army, also confined to barracks as part of the pact.
But Nepal's interim Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said earlier this year that the People's Liberation Army combatants were too ""politicised"" to join the regular army.
The Maoists say it must happen.
""Our major objective is to be part of the national army, and after we are joined we can build a new Nepal,"" said smiling deputy brigade commander Madhu Lama, 25, who was selected by camp leaders along with other soldiers to be interviewed by AFP.
""If it doesn't happen we won't be able to make a new Nepal.""
For now, the camp is offering classes to the soldiers, many of whom left school early.
""We are giving them military training as well as some other kinds of training such as computer classes, driving classes, English language and medical,"" said Bibidh.
""They are also taking classes in political economy and philosophy.""
Soldiers at the camp said they were willing to go into any line of work that their leaders decided on.
""I will find work according to my abilities,"" said Anita, 23, whose husband was killed in fighting with the army, leaving her with a toddler.
""If I am able to join the army, I will, but if that's not possible, I can do something else.""

More than 60 people were injured.
The violence broke out Friday. Supporters of Prashant Tamang, the recent winner of the TV singing competition, took to the streets of the town of Siliguri in the eastern state of West Bengal to protest against what they perceived as a radio show host's ethnic slur against Tamang, said state police official R.J.S. Nalwa. Tamang is an Indian citizen of Nepalese origin.
The protesters apparently blocked a road and refused to let an ambulance carrying a patient pass, which led to clashes between Tamang's supporters and a group accompanying the ambulance, said Nalwa.
Police intervened, firing guns and tear gas and using batons in self-defense, said Nalwa. Twelve police officers were among the injured, he said.
Authorities imposed a curfew Friday in the area, which is located in the Darjeeling district about 354 miles north of Calcutta. In some areas, the curfew was still in effect Saturday, though police said the situation was under control.
In a message to his fans, Tamang called for peace, saying, ""violence has no place in song or music.""

Bhairahawa [west Nepal], 16 December: Border officials from Nepal and India met at Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha.
The meeting discussed measures to control cross-border terrorist activities, smuggling and women trafficking.
Top security officials from both sides discussed the need to exchange information on the terrorists and criminals involved in cross-border activities. For this, the officials agreed to share identities, personal details and photographs of such people.
The officials also agreed to coordinate and cooperate to stop border encroachment, regulate border movement and curb trafficking of women and illegal drugs.
The two sides agreed to work together to control the trans-border crimes in the 140km stretch of the open border in Lumbini zone, said chief district officer of Rupandehi Ganga Datta Awasthi. [passage omitted]
The border meeting also discussed ways to lessen security hassles faced by the people on both sides. In the past, regular border meetings would take place every three months, but this time the meeting took place at an interval of one year.

"4059",2005825,"Title: Indians pin blast carnage on Kashmir rebels.rtf; Date: November 5, 2005 Saturday 1:07 AM GMT; Text: A lack of hard evidence has not sidetracked Indian investigators from a firm belief that well-organised Kashmiri separatists planted the bombs that killed 62 people a week ago in the capital New Delhi.
Full forensic reports were still expected -- although much evidence was tarnished by the milling crowds at the two market areas devastated by the October 29 blasts.
But investigators say traces of the military explosive RDX and the modus operandi of the killers point to hardline Kashmiri militants.
The Islamic Inqilabi Mahaz (Islamic Revolutionary Group -- IIM), which claimed responsibility for the blasts, is closely linked to the better known Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) -- the prime suspect in India's eyes.
A chorus of denials from Pakistan-based rebel groups such as LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad has not swayed India.
Security experts say the denials may even have been ""sponsored"" by Pakistan's military intelligence establishment, which monitors such groups and is wary of international condemnation.
Arun Bhagat, former Intelligence Bureau (IB) director for India's domestic secret service, told AFP it was quite plausible for Lashkar-e-Taiba to revive the IIM name as a smokescreen to avoid US retribution.
LeT, a pan-Islamic group which has been involved in a number of deadly attacks including some in Kashmir, is on a US list of terror groups.
Indian police probing the New Delhi attacks, which also left 210 people injured, said they were in contact with experts who pursued IIM before it retreated from the disputed Himalayan region in 1993.
""Initially we took the claim as a mere boast of an obscure group but now a wealth of data on the terrorists is available to us"" that points to LeT, said a senior officer from the police anti-terrorism squad.
B. Raman, who headed the anti-terrorism unit of India's external intelligence service when it launched a covert drive to crush IIM, accused his Pakistani counterparts of covertly backing anti-Indian groups such as IIM.
""The IIM in the 1980s was a well-known group and it was very active fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan until 1987,"" he said.
IIM, based in the Pakistani city of Lahore, came to Indian Kashmir in 1989 and fought Indian troops from a base in the southern Poonch sector until 1993, he said.
""We got a whiff of their existence when 12 cross-border militants from Pakistan were intercepted while sneaking into Kashmir,"" where the armed rebellion has claimed more than 44,000 lives over 16 years, Raman said.
""Thereafter, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence sent the Lashkar-e-Taiba to set up base in Kashmir with the IIM's help,"" he said.
""The Lashkar then took over the leadership and the IIM became dormant with most of its cadres being arrested or killed,"" Raman told AFP, however noting IIM's ongoing contacts with Islamic extremists in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
IIM and another obscure group claimed responsibility for the slaying of four US oil workers in Pakistan, saying it was to protest the US trial of a Pakistani for the 1993 assassination of two Central Intelligence Agency agents.
Bhagat said, however, that after 1997, IIM -- registered in Pakistan as a charitable institution -- melted into Lashkar-e-Taiba.
""Nothing is material. These names, claims or denials have no meaning,"" he said.
""The only thing solid is that all these forces have one goal: the dismemberment of India and Kashmir.""
India's intelligence community realised IIM was not defunct when an Indian Airlines plane was hijacked in 1999 from Nepal to Afghanistan.
The attackers demanded the release from an Indian jail of one-time IIM leader Zulfikar Ali, among others, ""which meant the IIM was very much in business,"" added Raman.
Lashkar-e-Taiba headed the list of militant groups issuing denials of responsibility for the Delhi blasts, but retired general V.N. Sharma, who headed India's million-plus army when the Kashmir insurgency erupted, scoffed.
""Lashkar's disclaimer does not mean it is clean. Any organisation will disown such attacks as it would bring tremendous pressure on Pakistan from the United States,"" the general said.
Premier Manmohan Singh, who chaired a meeting Friday with investigators, told Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf last week that the militants who attacked Delhi had ""external links"" -- meaning Pakistan, in Indian parlance.

"5171",20067040,"Title: In strife-torn Nepal , 1,500 Israelis celebrate huge passover meal.rtf; Date: April 14, 2006 Friday 10:41 AM GMT; Text: Violent protests on top of a bloody, decade-long Maoist insurgency have seen the number of visitors to Nepal reduced to a trickle, but hundreds of Israelis descended on the capital to celebrate a huge passover gathering.
On Wednesday night, some 1,500 people, many wearing Nepali-made yamulkes (skullcaps), convened in a hotel to celebrate the festival with a traditional meal, a four-piece Israeli band and officiating rabbis.
The hotel kitchens had to be blow-torched clean to ensure they were kosher, and rabbis had to slaughter the chickens themselves. But with a volunteer workforce of backpackers, they managed to get everything in place for the ""seder"", a meal and religious ceremony that celebrates the flight of the 12 tribes of Israel from slavery in Egypt 3,000 years ago.
The massive celebration came about because of a combination of a lack of Jews in Nepal, and international diplomacy, Dan Stav, Israel's ambassador to Nepal told AFP.
Traditionally, passover is celebrated with only close family, but around 20 years ago, the embassy here started inviting whichever Israeli tourists were in Kathmandu to the embassy to share in a meal. 
The numbers grew, and seven years ago, the celebration began to be organised by Beit Chabad, an othodox Jewish group and spiritual outreach service.
""When you go to other destinations whether it be Latin America or Europe or North America you have quite big Jewish communities, whereas here you have none,"" the ambassador told AFP. 
""In the past, it was easy to come to Nepal rather than India or China or other places because of diplomatic relations. Full diplomatic relations with India and China were only established in 1992,"" said Stav.
Now the meal has become an integral part of the travel plans for hundreds of backpackers.
""You ask people in Israel about Nepal and they tell you 'there's this great seder. Its the biggest in the world. It's a once in a lifetime thing',"" said 22 year-old Or Alon, who had volunteered to help with seder preparations.
""As soon as I decided to travel, I knew that I would do seder in Nepal,"" said Alon who recently completed two years national service in the Israeli army.
Most of the people at the celebration Wednesday were in their 20s and travelling after serving their time in the armed forces.
Embassies, including that of Israel, have been issuing increasingly strong travel warnings about coming to Nepal because of the ongoing political crisis.    In the last five days four people have been killed by security forces during nationwide anti-royal protests and a Maoist insurgency has killed over 12,500 people in the last 10 years. But this does not worry Alon.
""Nobody here wants to hurt me. Not the Maoists, not the government. I am neutral. Its the only place I have been where I feel neutral,"" Alon said as he crumbled cooked eggs into a vast vat to make salad.
Stav, the ambassador, was more cautious and said that embassy warnings should be heeded.
""Tourists are not targets for any of the people here, and we emphasise this fact. However, we say that there is a growing danger that you may find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he said.
Samuel Maron, the owner of a large travel company in Israel, is more cautious than Alon about the situation in Nepal, but it still didn't stop him coming.
Middle-aged Maron stood out from the hundreds of dreadlocked and tattooed young Israelis at the seder, but was having a great time despite being older than the fathers of most of the people there.
""We planned this six months ago. We heard about it from our sons who were here 10 years ago. We love to see our youth spending one evening together because they are scattered all over the far east,"" Maron said.
For the ambassador, the appeal of celebrating passover in Nepal was clear.
""It has long roots, Nepal is a very exotic country, and to have passover in a country you can see the Himalaya from is something special,"" he said.

Text of report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 20 February
[by Lila Raj Khanal]
Kathmandu, [Tuesday] 19 February: The key ruling parties have agreed to reject the demands of the Terai plains to declare the Terai plains a separate province and give them the right of autonomy. A meeting of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal-UML Madhav Kumar Nepal and Maoist chairman Prachanda held at the official residence of the prime minister at Baluwatar reached this agreement on Tuesday.
Meeting those demands may lead to national disintegration, the three leaders concluded. Therefore, the leaders agreed that those demands should never be met.
According to CPN-UML leader Jhala Nath Khanal, who participated in the meeting, the leaders have agreed to meet other demands excluding these two, even before the election of the constituent assembly.
The meeting decided that the election may be rescheduled only if the Democratic Madhesi Front sits for dialogue and agrees to take part in the election. Otherwise, the election programme would go ahead as scheduled. The meeting decided to instruct the government to conduct the election as scheduled even if it takes to mobilize the security forces, if the front refuses to participate in the election.
The top leaders have reiterated their commitment not to reschedule the election at any cost, a source said.
The Election Commission has asked the political parties to submit the closed list of candidates for the proportional system of election.
There is rising mistrust, says the Terai front
Meanwhile, the Terai front says there is clear difference between what the government says and does as it is spreading state terror and repression in the plains. The front said public trust in the government has further eroded. The government is now under suspicion, it said.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the front said it would continue its peaceful movement and try to find a solution to the problem via negotiation. 
The front has paid its respects to Guljar Khan, who attained ""martyrdom"" [i.e. died in unrest] in Banke District.
After the front took this decision, the representatives of the front visited the prime minister's official residence for talks at the invitation of the prime minister. The Terai leaders left the prime minister's residence after three hours saying that they would join the talks again only after the government repression on the Terai movement come to an end.
Anil Kumar Jha of the Sadbhavana Party, who participated in the talks, said the talks will progress only if the repression against the Terai movement comes to a halt. The representatives of the Madhesi front had forwarded a demand to declare as martyrs those killed during the movement in the Terai and pay for treatment for those injured. If those demands are met, we will sit for the next round of talks, he said.
Nepali Congress central member Amod Prasad Upadhyay, Mahesh Acharya and Dr Shekhar Koirala were in the prime minister's team. 
The seven-party alliance is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the Terai issues.

"6366",20072957,"Title: Nepal government halts payments to king.rtf; Date: July 12, 2007 Thursday 1:25 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's government scrapped payments to King Gyanendra and vowed to nationalise royal property in a budget presented to parliament on Thursday that deals a major blow to the embattled monarch.
The king has been under pressure since fiercely-republican Maoists signed a peace deal with mainstream parties last year and entered Kathmandu's corridors of power. The latest government move adds to signs that he may soon be removed.
Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat's 2.6-billion-dollar budget for the Himalayan nation, one of the world's poorest, contained no provisions for the royal palace.
In last year's budget, the annual royal household allowance had already been cut from 10.6 million dollars to three million dollars.
Mahat also announced that royal properties -- dozens of grand palaces and huge parks -- would be seized ""in the national interest.""
He added that the ""nationalisation of the properties of the royal palace will be implemented on a time-bound basis.""
With former Maoist rebels in government and parliament, analysts said it was hardly surprising that the budget had pulled the financial plug on the palace.
""The government has not allocated any money in this year's budget for the king... the royal budget has been totally scrapped,"" said Prem Khanal, a senior business reporter at the English-language Kathmandu Post newspaper.
""If any money had been allocated for the palace, it would have been unlikely to have been approved,"" he said.
Gyanendra -- who is known to have a large private income from business -- came to the throne in 2001 in tragic and bizarre circumstances after an apparently drunk and drugged Crown Prince Dipendra killed most of his family, including the king and queen, and then himself.
Although viewed by loyalists as the reincarnation of a Hindu deity, King Gyanendra -- the brother of the slain king -- lost public support in February 2005 when he sacked the government and assumed direct control of the nation.
He claimed the government was corrupt and had failed to end the Maoists' decade-long ""People's War.""
A 14-month period of dictatorial rule ended in April last year after massive protests organised by sidelined political parties and Maoists rocked the country and left at least 19 people dead.
Since the peace deal brought the Maoists into Kathmandu, the king has been stripped of his status as head of the army and head of state.
Gyanendra's fate is set to be decided after polls in November that will elect a body to rewrite Nepal's constitution -- and decide whether the 238-year-old monarchy should stay or go.
Rather than giving cash to the crown, the budget included the allocation of 54 million dollars for the crucial polls.
""That (election) day is going to gift us democratic rights and privileges for which we will not have to struggle again and again,"" the finance minister told deputies.
The budget represented a 17 percent year-on-year increase, and the government is appealing for international loans and grants to make up a shortfall of 687.6 million dollars.

He added that the committee will publish authentic travel information through periodic briefings to the media and the travelers.
Tourism is one of the major foreign currency earner for Nepal, which once earned about 170 million US dollar annually. However, tourists arrival declined sharply due to the anti-government guerrillas' insurgency in recent years.
More foreign travelers have come to visit Nepal since the cease- fire announcement by the government and the insurgents on Jan. 29 this year.

Text of report by Nepalese Kantipur Television on 22 November
[Presenter] The leaders of the seven opposition parties and the Maoists have reached a 12-point agreement to end autocracy in the country and restore the democratic process. The seven opposition parties revealed that they had reached a 12-point agreement with the Maoists, while the Maoists made public the agreement through email. According the agreement paper distributed to the media this evening, the two sides have made elections to a constituent assembly as the common point for agreement to establish peace. The two sides have also said that they will start a nationwide campaign to end autocracy in the country.

[Madhav Kumar Nepal] Now we will be moving towards ending autocracy in the country to restore democracy and we have come to an understanding between all the political parties. If the king understands these issues and takes appropriate steps, all will be fine. Otherwise, the agitations will rise and they [the king's supporters] must wonder what will happen to whom. They [the Maoists] have also agreed to put their armed fighters and weapons under a UN and a credible member of the international community's supervision. What the Maoists have said is that we [the opposition parties and the Maoists] must hold a round table conference before going for a constituent assembly. This is their request. We are yet to hold further talks on the process, but we have all reached consensus that the common focal point for reaching an agreement is an election to a constituent assembly.

The Maoists have said that they would respect the outcome of the result constituent assembly. The Maoists have also said that the Royal Nepalese Army should be placed under UN supervision.
The seven opposition parties and the Maoists have concluded that a national agitation campaign and a constituent assembly were the only way to give an outlet to the country problems. They two sides have also committed themselves to letting displaced people return to their homes and return their property and do some soul searching on the mistakes committed in the past to make sure that similar mistakes are not made in the future.

Speaking to Kantipur Television after meeting the leaders of the six parties, Nepal said there was no other alternative other than an election to a constituent assembly to establish peace.
[Madhav Kumar Nepal] We discussed the various stages of our talks with the Maoists. The CPN-UML as well as other parties have reached understandings with the Maoists. There was a need to give final touches to these understandings. We have agreed to give the final touches to the understandings (Reached with the Maoists). We will make public the outcome of the meeting after the working group concludes its meeting this evening.

"801",20032821,"Title: U.N. Beefs Up Congo Military Presence.rtf; Date: September 5, 2003 Friday; Text: Swooping in by helicopter, Lt. Col. Robert Polley had a simple message for the Lendu tribal leaders who control this village in northeastern Congo.
""The time for numerous armed groups is over,"" the British officer, a member of the new United Nations force in the region, told Lendu militia leaders on Thursday.
""We have every intention of peace-making and peacekeeping,"" he warned them. ""We have the mandate, troops, equipment and the will to do so.""
It's a tough message from the new force charged with putting an end to the fighting between Hema and Lendu tribal militias that has ravaged Ituri province, killing thousands.
It's also a major shift in strategy for the United Nations, which in the past has sent troops to Ituri, but only to protect staff and equipment.
The five-year civil war in Congo has all but ended, but fighting between the Hema and Lendu, a disastrous byproduct of the conflict, continues throughout much of resource-rich province.
Last month, Lendu fighters killed at least 200 people and abducted scores more during a series of attacks that destroyed the town of Fataki, 40 miles northwest of Bunia, Hema fighters said.
Officials from the United Nations mission in Congo, or MONUC, could not confirm those figures.
But military observers who flew over Fataki in helicopter gunships shortly afterward spotted only a few people picking through the remains of smoldering houses, said Leo Salmeron, a MONUC spokesman.
A 2,000-strong French-led force was sent to the provincial capital, Bunia, in June to secure the city and enable aid workers to operate after weeks of fighting between the Hema and Lendu tribes that had killed some 500 people and forced thousands to flee.
The French-led force was called for after some 700 Uruguayan peacekeepers in Bunia found themselves outnumbered and outgunned by the rebels when fighting erupted in May following the withdrawal of Ugandan troops.
The Uruguayans were only allowed to shoot in self-defense and had to hunker down behind sandbags and razor wire as Congolese civilians died in the streets around them.
While the French-led force had a mandate to stabilize Bunia, the new U.N. force that took over on Sept. 1 has orders to fan out into the surrounding countryside, sweeping through villages in search of weapons. The thousands of fighters in Ituri will be put in camps to learn how to live normal lives.
""Those who resist us, they will be isolated and regarded as criminal gangs,"" said Brig. Gen. Jan Isberg, deputy commander of the U.N. force.
So far, 2,500 U.N. soldiers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Uruguay have arrived in Ituri. Another 2,300 are on the way.
When fighting breaks out, U.N. soldiers will ""intervene wherever and whenever necessary,"" said Maj. Gen. Mountaga Diallo, commander of all U.N. forces in Congo.
However, the international forces face an enormous task and it is not clear how cooperative the Hema and Lendu will be.
The Lendu leaders sat stone-faced as Polley described the new policy on Thursday in the village of Kwandruma near the shores of Lake Albert.
Afterward, they said they only fight when provoked and will be glad to stop.
What is clear is that the residents in Kwandruma want an end to the fighting, which has killed an estimated 50,000 in recent years.
""We have fled our homes and hid in the bush too many times, we have abandoned our farms too many times, and we have lost too much and too many relatives,"" said Laleni Kakura, a 42-year-old mother of six.
The Hema and Lendu have traditionally clashed over land and resources in the fertile province rich with timber, gold and the mineral coltan needed to make mobile phones.
But the clashes became more deadly in 1999, when the tribal fighters were armed with modern weapons and used as proxies by the Congolese government and rebels fighting in the broader civil war.
The war broke out in August 1998 when Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila.
The Congolese government and rebels are now working out the kinks in a fledging transitional government.
In Ituri, the United Nations is pinning its hopes for short-term stability on its more robust military presence.
However, it recognizes that long term peace will only be achieved through a political solution, said Behrooz Sadry, the deputy chief of the U.N. mission in Congo, or MONUC.
""Our military presence is merely a tool for pacification,"" he said.

Home Ministry spokesman Modraj Dotel confirmed the helicopter was carrying U.N. personnel, and said initial reports indicated eight people were on board. There was no immediate report of how many people may have survived.
U.N. officials in Nepal declined to comment, saying they were seeking more information.
Villagers saw a ball of fire after the helicopter crashed on a mountain near Bethani, a village about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Katmandu, police official Chinu Acharya said by telephone.
Sudden rain on Monday forced the cancellation of many scheduled commercial flights and prevented rescue helicopters from reaching the crash site.
Flying in bad weather is often difficult in Nepal, which is mostly covered by mountainous terrain. Pilots often use their vision to navigate through the mountains and depend less on instruments.
The United Nations has been helping Nepal's peace process since 2006, when communist rebels gave up their armed revolt and joined mainstream politics. The rebels confined their combatants and weapons in camps under the supervision of U.N. arms monitors.

""My name is Seif Adnan Kanaan. I work at Mosul airport ... My second job is to supply beverages to the US army,"" said the man, who was surrounded by three hooded gunmen, apparently referring to alcoholic drinks.
One of the gunmen read a statement saying that ""the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters) in Mosul were able to capture ... a crusader spy recruited by US forces to spy and inform on the mujahedeen in Mosul.""
The statement did not give the man's nationality but his name and the wording of the statement suggested he was an Iraqi Christian.
The gunman said the purported spy worked at a US base in Mosul airport and ""was known for his allegiance to the Americans and his hatred for the mujahedeen."" He had ""publicly insulted (Islam's) Prophet Mohammad.""
The man was beheaded after ""confessing to all the actions he carried out,"" he said.
The group also posted the statement on its website, accompanied by pictures of the beheading.
The video showed the man who read the statement later beheading the victim with a knife. He placed the head on the back of the victim, who lay in a pool of blood.
The man had been executed ""to serve as a lesson for others,"" the executioner said.
The victim, who appeared in his thirties, was shown in a picture surrounded by the three hooded gunmen with a banner of the Army of Ansar al-Sunna in the background.
""We tell people like him: the door of repentance is open ... Announce your repentance and live in peace among your kin,"" the statement said.
The mujahedeen will catch those who persist in working with US forces, and settle for nothing less than beheading them, the statement warned.
The Army of Ansar al-Sunna has issued videos and pictures of several alleged Iraqi collaborators and foreigners it beheaded.
The group, which is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda organization, killed 12 Nepalese workers in late August after taking them hostage.
Several other foreigners have also been beheaded after they were abducted by Islamist militant groups in Iraq in the past few months.

Text of report published by Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 14 December
Kathmandu, [Saturday] 13 December: Former Maoist leader Mani Thapa has said he will announce a new communist party that carries the ideology of people's war. He said there was a need for a new party because the Maoists had given up the path of people's war.
Thapa said that he would hold a national conference where he plans to announce a new political party. ""It is still not clear whether the proposed party will take the peaceful or armed path,"" he said. 
The new communist party was needed also for leftist polarization, Thapa said, claiming that he held a political debate before deciding on a new party. The Revolutionary Left Wing is a part of the party, he said.
Those victimized by the Maoist party and the workers of other leftist parties have joined the party, Thapa claimed. Intra-party conflict has surfaced in the Maoist party based on the cultural rebellion led by him three years ago, he added. The dissident leader claimed that a faction of Maoist party was assisting him, adding that the rise of neo-capitalism in the Maoist party has intensified contradiction and conflict.
Thapa said that the Revolutionary International Movement (RIM) had raised its concerns over Maoist party's failure to give continuity to the people's war. Commenting on the Maoist party and the CPN [Communist Party of Nepal]-Unity Centre unification bid, Thapa said they were staging a unification drama since they were unable to solve contradictions between the two parties. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ""Prachanda"" is in minority in the Maoist party and [Narayan Kaji Shrestha] Prakash in the Unity Centre. They are making a unification bid to manage the number game, Thapa said. The group has formed a 17-member committee, coordinated by Krishna Adhikari, to debate the new party in the leftist circle. Thapa and former Maoist leader Mumaram Khanal are the committee advisors. A group member said that one of the Maoist central leaders had participated in the debate held in Sindhupalchok District.

Tashi Dorje, an activist coordinating the march, said the group of 42 people reached the border point at Tatopani, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Katmandu, late Monday. The protesters avoided walking along the main highway from the capital fearing they would be arrested by Nepalese police.
""The demonstration will be to demand a free Tibet and to protest killings in Tibet,"" Dorje said.
Anti-government demonstrations broke out in March in Tibet. China says 22 people died in violence in the capital Lhasa, while foreign Tibet supporters say many times that number were killed in the protests and a subsequent crackdown.
Since then, near-daily demonstrations against Beijing's rule over the Himalayan region have occurred in neighboring Nepal, where thousands of Tibetan refugees live.
The China-Nepal border point is heavily guarded by Chinese troops who stepped up security since March.
It was not clear if Nepalese police planned to stop Tuesday's protest. Dorje said the group of Buddhist monks and nuns would begin hunger strikes if they were detained.
Tibetan refugees have protested almost daily in Katmandu since March, but it was the first time they moved demonstrations to the border. Nepal banned protests against China saying it would not tolerate demonstrations against any friendly nation.
The United Nations and international rights groups have criticized Nepal for using what they say is excessive force to stop the protests. Police have beaten people with batons and dragged them through the streets while detaining them.
China insists Nepal has not done enough to quell the demonstrations.
Every year thousands of Tibetan refugees cross into Nepal. Most eventually move to India, where Tibet's government-in-exile and the Tibetans' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, are based.

The rebels also attacked the jail in Illam, freeing more than 100 inmates, including suspected guerrillas.
The rebels blocked the only highway to the town, about 550 kilometers (345 miles) east of the capital, Katmandu, before launching the overnight attack, firing at the security bases and bombing several government buildings, said the chief officer of the district, Krishna Prasad Poudel.
Soldiers recovered the bodies of eight rebels, an army official, a policeman, and two civilians who were caught in the cross fire, he said. One policeman died while being treated at a hospital.
Twelve other police were wounded in the fighting, which continued until morning.
Government troops have taken control of the town and surrounding areas and are searching the mountainous terrain for the attackers, Poudel said.
An official at the Royal Nepalese Army headquarters in Katmandu, who cannot be named under government policy, said military helicopters equipped with night-vision capabilities reached the site around 2 a.m. and fired on the attackers.
The rebels fled before dawn, taking their wounded and dead fighters with them, the official said.
A total of 103 inmates in the jail were freed by the rebels, but 16 were later recaptured or surrendered to authorities.
The rebels have escalated attacks since withdrawing from a four-month unilateral cease-fire earlier this year because the government refused to join the truce.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, have fought for a decade to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist government. The insurgency has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.

He said poachers kill the animal for its horn which is used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries. Protection for the rhino has been cut because troops guarding the sanctuary are needed to combat an ongoing Maoist insurgency that has killed more than 11,000 people since 1996.
The one-horned rhino census is carried out every five years by the conservation department with financial and technical assistance from the World Wildlife Fund and the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation.
In the first census in 1994, there were 466 rhinos in the park.
""The main reason behind the decline in the rhino population is the merging of Royal Nepal Army protection posts to seven from 28 due to the Maoist insurgency,"" Karki said.
""Pollution and floods in the Rapti and Narayani rivers flowing along the park have contributed to the loss of their habitat and poaching has posed an even greater threat,"" Karki said.
Wildlife experts said the rhino horns can fetch as much as 4.0 million Nepalese rupees (56,800 dollars) a kilogram (25,820 dollars a pound) in the international market, according to the private news website the KantipurOnline.

Fighting for fulfillment of a 20-point demand, 85 employees of the satellite channel have been staging an agitation for the last 18 days. Some of the employees were also on a fast-unto-death strike.
  The demands of the journalists includes immediate issue of appointment letter to all the staff in accordance with Nepalese laws, payment of salaries within the first week of every month, and 10 per cent hike in salaries annually. The agitation came to an end on Monday morning after a 14-point understanding with the management of Nepal 1.
  The understanding was reached in presence of representatives from Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Labour and the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ).

Landslides and floods have killed 24 and left seven missing, while lighting killed another 25, said Kumar Poudel, chief of the Natural Calamity Disaster Management Center in Katmandu.
Due to the remoteness of many areas, it has been difficult to get information and send relief supplies, Poudel said. Some villages in this Himalayan kingdom have no roads or communication links, and can only be reached by walking for days.
Bad weather makes it difficult to fly supplies into the mountains.
Monsoons, which started in mid-June, kill hundreds of people in Nepal every year.
Workers are clearing landslide debris blocking a major highway linking Katmandu with other parts of Nepal.
The highway is a crucial link for the capital's residents as it is used to bring essential supplies, including food, from southern cities and adjoining India.

Chanting ""Free Tibet"" and ""Chinese thieves leave our country,"" the protesters approached the visa office of the Chinese Embassy in Katmandu.
Police officers stopped the protesters at the gate of the fortified compound and tried to push them away from the area. When the demonstrators refused to leave, the officers shoved some 100 protesters into vans and trucks and drove them to detention centers. About 50 more protesters ran away.
Tibetans have been protesting near refugee camps or near the United Nations' office in Katmandu since March 10, but this was the first anti-Chinese rally near the Chinese Embassy.
Police at the scene said they had been ordered to not allow any protests or slogans against China, which Nepal's government considers an ally.
Police broke up at least two protests by Tibetan refugees, monks and their supporters on Monday and arrested about 475 people, the U.N. said.
The U.N. human rights office has said it was ""deeply concerned at the arbitrary arrests and detentions of several hundred individuals.""
Nepal has not issued any statements on Beijing's crackdown on anti-Chinese protests in Tibet.
Nepal's border with China in the Himalayas is a key route for Tibetans fleeing Chinese rule in the region.
Thousands of Tibetan refugees live with relatives in Nepal or in camps funded by aid groups. Most of the refugees eventually move to India, where Tibet's government-in-exile and its spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, are based.

 The anti-Maoist campaign, which started in Dailekh far western Nepal , has spread to Baglung, Pyuthan and Terhathum districts of western, mid-western and eastern regions respectively.
 According to reports, over 2,000 women of six VDCs village development committee areas took to the streets chanting anti-Maoist slogans in Kasmisera on Sunday 5 December .
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 6 Dec 04On Saturday, thousand of protesters from 16 different VDCs of Baglung took part in the anti-Maoist campaign initiated by People's Front Nepal (PFN) Janamorcha Nepal .
 On Monday last week, Maoists had brutally tortured a dozen of PFN members (men and women) by piercing their bodies with hand drilling machines.
 In Pyuthan and Terhathum, PFN has started protest programmes against Maoist violence. Reports citing PFN local leaders said that the PFN was launching various programmes against Maoists' activities in the districts.
 Nepali Congress and CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) supporters have also expressed solidarity in the anti-Maoist campaign initiated by PFN, it is reported. The PFN has announced nationwide protest programmes on 8 December to condemn Maoists' atrocities.
 Meanwhile, according to a report published in Nepal Samacharpatra on Monday, PFN cadres have captured six rebels including a ""judge"" of the Maoist-run district people's court, Chiranjibi, from Damake and Hugdishir VDCs.

"4962",20065400,"Title: Nepal 's rebels, government struggle to meet peace timetable.rtf; Date: November 21, 2006 Tuesday 7:17 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoists and the interim government struggled Tuesday to clinch a landmark peace deal as last-minute talks dragged on and work to build special camps for insurgent arms remained unfinished.
""There are some issues to be finalised, and we are still discussing them. We hope it will be signed Tuesday,"" rebel negotiator Dev Gurung told AFP.
Government negotiator Pradeep Gyawali also said he was ""hopeful that the agreement will be signed by Tuesday evening"", but likewise gave no explanation for the hold-up.
The agreement was struck on November 8 and had been due to be signed last week. A Tuesday deadline was then set. Under the deal, the rebels are to end their 10-year ""people's war"", enter government and parliament and place their armed troops under UN monitoring.
The 90,000-strong Nepal Army was also supposed to be confined to quarters by Tuesday.
""Its unlikely that we will meet this deadline, because the United Nations is unlikely to deploy its personnel for verification of the People's Liberation Army weapons and personnel by Tuesday,"" Gurung explained.
He did, however, stress that ""our PLA comrades have already gathered in the seven areas where they will be confined"".
The personal representative sent by UN chief Kofi Annan said last week that the world body was waiting for the peace agreement to be signed before it could begin its monitoring mission.
Once deadly foes, the government and Maoist rebels have observed a ceasefire for more than six months, after they cooperated in April to organise mass protests that forced King Gyanendra to restore parliament and end direct rule. 
The peace deal leaves the king facing an uncertain future, with the fiercely republican rebels vowing they will not rest until Nepal's almost 240-year-old monarchy is abolished.
The parties in the coalition favour the king, revered by many as a Hindu deity, maintaining a ceremonial role -- although on Monday an official panel called for Gyanendra to be punished for ordering a deadly crackdown by security forces during April's protests.
The rebels say they are undergoing a major political makeover, but are also under pressure to put an end to activities including alleged forced recruitment.
On Monday the United States, which continues to class the Maoists as a terrorist organisation, denounced what it said was ""the continued forced recruitment of Nepalis, including children"".
A top rebel denied the charge.
""We have not recruited children in our People's Liberation Army, but summoned all our party cadres who had gone to their homes after the ceasefire,"" said Dina Nath Sharma, a rebel peace negotiator.
Nepal's civil war has claimed at least 12,500 lives since 1996.
This is the third time that the rebels and government have tried to hammer out a peace deal in the impoverished Himalayan nation. Two previous attempts in 2001 and 2003 failed, plunging the country back into conflict.

 The Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) Sunday 18 April said the arrests and manhandling of journalists was a deliberate attempt of the government to gag the press.
 FNJ chairman Tara Nath Dahal speaking at a program in the capital said the arrest of journalists was an expression of the defeatist mentality of the government.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 19 Apr 04
""The action against journalists is a pre-planned move. The government is panicking since the journalists have stood in favor of democracy,"" he said. He further said that Kamal Thapa, the minister for information and communication must step down, taking responsibility of the attack on the spirit of free press.
 Dahal also revealed that the FNJ has decided to carry on the battle for press freedom to the hilt. It was also informed at the program that five journalists, three by government forces and two by Maoists, have been killed during the insurgency while 31 underwent torture at the hands of army personnel.
 Meanwhile, three journalists who were covering the five-party agitations were beaten up by the police at Bagbazaar this afternoon. Police went berserk when they saw black bands on their hands symbolizing protests.
 Swagat Nepal of Nepal Samacharpatra, Shital Koirala of RSS news agency and Damodar Dawadi were injured in the incident.
 In many districts, journalists wore black bands and took out rallies in protest of police action, reports said.

 The anti-government faction of the ruling Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) on Thursday 29 April launched first-ever protests in Kathmandu, renewing its demand for an all-party cabinet. Addressing a mass meeting of party cadres at New Baneshor, RPP President Pashupati Shumsher Rana said the incumbent Thapa government is the main ""obstacle"" in resolving the feuds among what he called the ""pro-constitutional forces"".
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 29 Apr 04
""An all-party government is the only way out now,"" Rana reiterated. On polls, he said it should be held only after constituting such a government. He, however, remained silent on whether the five agitating parties should lead such a cabinet. On the five parties' protest, he blamed the government of suppressing it. At the same time, he said it was not the ""proper"" time to launch such agitations.
 Former Prime Minister and RPP leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand said PM Surya Bahadur Thapa has failed to address national issues and give an outlet to the current political impasse. ""In Thapa's tenure, unrest has increased by manifold,"" Chand said. RPP activists marched in rallies at Sinamangal, Babarmahal, Tinkune and Old Baneshor areas before the rallies converged into the mass meeting. They chanted slogans such as, ""Stop violence"", ""We want an all-party government"", and ""Long live constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy"", among others.

""We expect the death toll to be much higher … as reports could take as much as a week to reach us,"" said Durgaraj Sharma of Natural Calamity Disaster Management Center.
The landslides hit the villages Tuesday night in Okhaldhunga district, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the Nepalese capital, Katmandu.
Sharma said many were injured and houses were buried or damaged by debris. Rescuers were ferried to the area by helicopter to bring out the injured and to distribute packaged food, cooking utensils and plastic sheets for temporary shelters, since roads were blocked.
In Nepal's inundated southern region, reports said 10 people drowned and two were buried under landslides on Monday and Tuesday.
Phone lines have been cut and roads washed away by the floods, delaying information on deaths and damage from reaching officials.
A major concern is drinking water in inundated areas, where wells and pipelines have been contaminated and could spread waterborne disease, officials said.
Workers continued to clear the two main highways leading into Katmandu, after landslides severed the capital from the rest of the country. Officials said they hoped to partially open the highway for one-way traffic soon.
The weather has improved in the Himalayan kingdom's southern, central and western regions, and meteorologists predict it will get better as the week progresses.
Floods kill scores of people and leave thousands homeless in Nepal each year during the rainy season, which usually starts in early June. It began late this year, and is expected to last until September.

 Ilam, 3 November: The local administration has stopped the movement of food in the eastern hill region after learning rebel Maoists are storing it there.
 The administration has stopped 20 trucks laden with food heading for the hills at Ilam Bazzar for the last three days.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 4 Nov 03Traders said the move will create a food crisis in Panchthar and Taplejung in the eastern region.
 A truck driver said he did not know why he was stopped. The truck was carrying rice, oil and beaten rice. He said security officials told him to go to district headquarters on Sunday 2 November . The local administration had been monitoring the movement of trucks with food and other goods over the last four months.
 A senior police official at district headquarters said the movement of food was controlled after reports were received that Maoists were storing food. He claimed the move was not to harass people.
 Before this, the sale of more than 10 kilos of grain was banned in Taplejung and Panchthar districts.
 Besides the sale of grains, the administration is also monitoring the sale of chow, biscuits, oil and other goods. The administration said the move was taken after Maoists asked traders for the food deliveries. Traders want a quick investigation for relief.

 Kathmandu, 5 January: Political parties today responded more or less on their known and expected way to the public speech made by His Majesty King Gyanendra on Friday 3 January in Biratnagar.
 While Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) chief Pashupati Shumsher Rana saw enough scope for a conciliation between the king and the political parties, especially after the Biratnagar speech, leaders of Nepali Congress, CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and People's Front Nepal felt that much depended on how he acted instead of on what he said.
 Speaking during a face-to-face programme organized by the Reporters' Club in the capital, RPP leader Rana said: ""We must not be pessimistic just yet, if we expect to avert the worst."" Rana also said that the speech came at a time when there are specific developments in the backdrop. Speaking in an emotional tone, Rana put up a query as to why the parties were not ready to give benefit of doubt to the king, just as they are giving the benefit of doubt to the rebels. Rana, however, conceded that some unexpected developments had overtaken the nation on 4 October and that the parties must cooperate in a positive manner to avert the crisis which could threaten nationalism.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 6 Jan 03
The king had dismissed an elected government on 4 October last year and assumed all executive powers. Last Friday, in his speech in Biratnagar, the monarch had re-affirmed his commitment to constitutional monarchy and democracy.
 Meanwhile, leaders of other political parties were scathingly critical of the king's speech.
 Nepali Congress (NC) central leader, Narahari Acharya, billed the speech as ""interesting since it was the first speech of a king who wields executive powers"". ""However, positive note lies in the fact that he has not added to the bitterness generated by the 4 October royal move,"" Acharya added sarcastically. ""It would have been better had the king announced possible measures to resolve the crisis dogging the nation."" Acharya further said that although the executive monarch has expressed commitment to democracy, three months after taking over the executive rights, the same however does not gel with the turn of events over the same time period. ""Expressing commitment without any cogent proof is useless,"" he emphatically said. The Nepali Congress leaders also chastised the monarchy for trying to retain political power, even after constitutional monarchy was enshrined by the constitution. ""Yes, monarchy was a power at the end of the (1990) movement for the restoration of democracy, but not after the promulgation of the constitution which has rendered the king as an institution.""
 Similar views were expressed by Homnath Dahal, spokesperson of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), the party which held power when it was dismissed by the monarch on 4 October. But Dahal reiterated his party's demand to restore the ousted government as a way out of the present crisis.
 People's Front Nepal (PFN) leader Amik Sherchan was of the view that the royal address at the civic reception was stale and, as always, the value of same would be decided on the basis of whether political and constitutional course take the desired direction. He also said that the speech contained all the tenets of a garbled speech of an executive authority. ""The need of the time is to speak in clear terms rather than in ambiguous terms,"" he further said. Sherchan also attacked the government for failing to either announce poll dates or hold talks with Maoist rebels.
 CPN-UML leader Modnath Prasrit, billed the speech as ""formulaic"" and said that what matters most is the ultimate motive. He went back to the year 1959 when ""King Mahendra, too, had promised much the similar things but the elected government was dismissed in the following year.""
 The late King Mahendra, the present king's father, had dismissed Nepal's first elected government in December 1960, slightly a year after the first general elections.
 ""The time has come when our relations with monarch ought to be weighed on the constitutional scales,"" Prasrit further said, saying that the monarch would have done well had he announced return of the executive power on the government. He also expressed the view that the king ought to have dropped the idea of competing with political parties in a public place.
 Meanwhile, Minister of Education and Sports Devi Prasad Ojha, representing the government side, assured the political parties of an all-party meeting soon ""which the government thinks can go a long way in garnering due support to resolve the Maoist insurgency"". He said the government was working on the agenda and would soon seek the reaction and suggestion of all the major political parties.

The convener of the Maoist negotiating team, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, called the draft law a remarkable achievement and said it will adapt Nepal to a new era.
The draft law suggests that the question of monarchy in Nepal should be resolved through a referendum to be held at the time of the constituent assembly election.
No date for the election has been announced yet.
Nepalese political parties and Maoist rebels last year agreed to elect a special assembly to write a new constitution and end the armed insurgency, which has left more than 13,000 Nepalese dead since it began in 1996.

Long lines of vehicles formed outside army- and police-run petrol stations in the face of the shutdown of 1,578 petrol stations operated by members of the Nepal Petroleum Dealers' Association.
""We have announced a nationwide indefinite strike,"" said its president Shiva Prasad Ghimire.
The association said it wants government compensation following losses incurred during the two days of protests in which demonstrators vandalised at least 16 petrol stations.
The government late Friday raised the price of petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas by as much as 25 per cent to offset the impact of soaring global oil prices on Nepal Oil Corp (NOC), which sells fuel at subsidised prices in the impoverished kingdom.
The state-run petroleum company called on the association to end its strike and warned that trading licenses could be revoked.
""If they fail to respond to our call, the government will be compelled to take stringent action that could include suspension or termination of sales licenses,"" said NOC spokesman Mukunda Prasad Dhungel.

 The inaugural session was addressed, among others, by WTO Representative Stefania Bernabe, UNIDO Representative Lalith Goonatilaka, Representative of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry Nihal Abey Sekera and Director General of BSTI Ahmad Mahmudur Raza Chowdhury.
 Nizami said, SAARC LDCS could not avail themselves of the opportunity of the free market due to lack of technical capacity to meet the requirements of the agreement on TBT Technical Barriers to Trade and the SPS Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the WTO (World Trade Organization).
 He stressed the need for increasing capacity to produce quality products that will conform the standard of international market.
 Dwelling on the objective of the workshop, Stefenia said it was a ""beginning"" of a long step.
 The workshop is expected to acquaint the SAARC LDCs, including Bangladesh with the whole gamut of TBT requirements under the WTO, she said.
 Implementation of the agreement on TBT would enable both developing and least developed countries to capture a significant slice of market in the developed market, she remarked.

"4319",20065233,"Title: Security firm denies Fijian guards in Iraq targeted.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: May 9, 2006 Tuesday
Text of report by Fijilive website on 9 May
Fiji nationals working as security guards in Iraq are not being targeted by the Iraqi resistance fighters, says private security firm ArmorGroup after another four Fiji men died in attacks last week.
However, the sudden upsurge of the deaths of Fijian guards in Iraq where eight men were killed in less then a fortnight has resulted in conspiracy theories that Fijians are now being targeted by the resistance. Ten Fijians have died in Iraq since its occupation by coalition soldiers since 2002.
""ArmorGroup does not suspect insurgents are targeting Fijians,"" says company director Christopher Beese. ""Rather, we note the coincidence and have investigated possible linkage as part of a wider investigation.""
The first four who died were Anasa Navukaro, Kelemedi Dreuvakabalawa, Malakai Sekibureta and Iosefo Cagi during an ambush at Kirkuk on April 19.
Fiji's first causalities in Iraq were Waisale Atalifo and Timoci Lalaqi, who died after their Russian-built Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by the Islamic Army in Iraq a year ago. Six Fijians serving with the British Army have also died in Iraq.
Beese believes the two incidents involving ArmorGroup Fijian security officers were random and that while they targeted coalition security forces the only other coincidence was the death of Fijians by nationality. He confirmed that the 30 April deaths of Josaia Senaisi, Alifereti Cereilagi and Sevuloni Nawaduadua were the result of an attack on their vehicles by a ""sophisticated IED (improvised explosive device)"".
Beese said they were escorting a convoy of trucks carrying reconstruction materials when the convoy was attacked 50 km southeast of Baghdad. ""Rapid response by Iraqi police and a coalition helicopter medical evacuation could not save the three lives,"" he added.
Beese also confirmed a second incident on 2 May where Viliame Ravatugaga died instantly because of ""the blast from a massive IED laid beneath the road as a landmine"". Ravatugaga was among those escorting a reconstruction convoy.
Beese said the role of the security guards in Iraq was to provide ""armed commercial security to commercial contractors to the coalition, which that the military does not undertake because of lack of resources"".
Some Fijian guards have reportedly showed concerns over the manner in which some private companies equip their guards, saying some went without proper armour and were armed with older generation South Korean K1 assault rifles.
There were also reports that the first three Fijians were in a SUV that was not armoured and ill-equipped to be part of the high-risk convoy.
Beese dispelled these saying ""all ArmorGroup employees, regardless of nationality (whether British, Fijian, Nepalese or Iraqi) are equipped with the same factory-armoured vehicles imported from America"".
He said the Fijians were issued with the same helmets and body armour and the same weapons, ""all of which compare very favourably with coalition military equipment"".
""Indeed, ArmorGroup equipment is some of the best and most expensive available; certainly not the cheapest or in any way unsuitable,"" Beese said. ""This equipment has provided very high levels of protection in actual attacks by insurgents.""
Beese said the company would provide financial support for families ""as they say farewell to their loved ones and will meet its obligations to compensate the families in accordance with contract and Fijian protocols"".
""ArmorGroup does not 'refuse' to give details of compensation but believes that is a private matter for discussion between the company, the families and relevant authorities,"" he said.
The bodies of the four are expected to have arrived to Fiji at 7 p.m. tonight [0700 gmt].

"5338",20061397,"Title: Nepal braces for more bloodshed in run-up to controversial polls.rtf; Date: January 13, 2006 Friday 9:47 AM GMT; Text: Nepal is bracing for increased violence, one day after 10 guerrillas were killed in the deadliest clashes between Maoist rebels and security forces since the end of the ceasefire earlier this month.
Controversial municipal polls set for February 8 and the first anniversary of King Gyanendra's seizure of power on February 1 were fanning fears of more  bloodshed in the impoverished Himalayan nation, analysts said.
Maoists are also preparing for the 10th anniversary of the launch of their so-called ""People's War"" on February 12, they said.
""The Maoists are building up for the expected big offensive,"" chief editor of the Nepali Times, a weekly English language newspaper, told AFP.
""There are a lot of things coming together in February -- that's probably when things will happen,"" editor Kunda Dixit said.
But Nepal's ill-equipped army said it was ready to counter any rebel challenge.
""The Maoists have intensified their activities to make their presence felt after breaking their ceasefire, but the army is prepared for counter-attacks,"" Brigadier General Nepal Bhushan Chand told AFP.
On Thursday, 10 rebels died in clashes between security forces and guerrillas near tourist town Pokhara in western Nepal, the army said, adding it suffered no casualties.
News of the clashes was splashed on the front pages of privately owned newspapers, fuelling concerns among Nepalese that violence is intensifying.
The death toll brought to 17 the number of people killed since the end of the four-month unilateral Maoist truce on January 2.
""We see violence escalating now and it will continue until the local polls are cancelled,"" said Minendra Rijal, spokesman of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), whose party was kicked out of power by Gyanendra last February.      The Maoists have vowed to thwart the municipal elections called by Gyanendra as part of his ""roadmap to democracy.""
Gyanendra, who claimed he had to sack the government and seize power to end the insurgency, has promised that the municipal polls will be followed by national elections before April 2007.
The Maoists have formed a loose anti-royal alliance with mainstream opposition parties that have vowed to boycott the municipal polls to be held in 58 municipalities.
Rejecting the polls, the opposition parties claim they are aimed at placating international disapproval of the king's takeover.
The alliance struck last November is increasingly isolating Gyanendra, said Kapil Shrestha, a political science professor at national Tribhuvan University.
""In the past, the activists from the seven-party alliance had worked with the king,"" Shrestha said. ""The seven-parties' supporters will no longer help the (royalist) government now.""
The insurgency has claimed over 12,500 lives in the world's only Hindu kingdom wedged between India and China.

"4581",20065734,"Title: Nepal 's parliament opens again after four-year break.rtf; Date: April 28, 2006 Friday 1:34 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's parliament sat for the first time in four years Friday, vowing to press for a new constitution that could cut the powers of King Gyanendra.
The monarch on Monday agreed in a televised address to reinstate parliament, buckling after 19 days of nationwide protests against his total rule that left at least 15 people dead.
""Welcome to all the members. We express our gratitude to those who died in the democracy struggle,"" said deputy speaker Chitra Lekha Yadav at the opening session.
""In order to save the country from the on-going political crisis, this parliament meeting has decided to form a new constituent assembly to go for a new constitution,"" Yadav said, to lengthy applause from the crowded chamber with most of the 205 members attending.
The parliament was committed to hold talks with Maoist rebels who have fought a decade-long insurgency, and to call a government ceasefire to make Nepal ""terror-free"", she said.
Politicians had said their key goal in the new parliament was to push for elections to a constituent assembly, a body that could redraw Nepal's 1990 constitution and reduce the powers of the king.
The king seized outright power in February last year after accusing the government of corruption and failure to quell a Maoist rebellion that has left some 12,500 dead since it erupted in 1996.
But in a sign of growing anti-royalty sentiment, staff failed to bring in a ceremonial royal staff that has been the usual prelude to the opening of parliamentary sessions for the last 15 years.
""It's important to publicise the decision to hold elections to the constituent assembly by holding discussions in parliament,"" said the speaker before adjourning the house until Sunday after a 35-minute session.
The speaker addressed the House just before 5:00 pm (11:15 GMT) nearly four hours after the scheduled start of business.
Her speech was punctuated by members beating their hands gently on the desks in front of them.
""What we've achieved is really admirable -- to go on united is what we need,"" she said.
""If we ever bring about such a political crisis again, not one of us would be left unpunished.""
She called a period of silence for those who died in the violent anti-royal protests.
The king dissolved parliament in May 2002 after political wrangling over extending emergency powers to tackle the Maoist insurgency.
The lower House of Representatives met under the close scrutiny of Maoists and protesters outside demanding a reduction of the king's powers as the price for their support.
The speaker congratulated the young protesters who had called for a republic and a constituent assembly during the protests and said their actions had provided a ""strong base"" for political progress.
The new premier, Girija Prasad Koirala, 84, did not attend the session because of a bout of bronchitis from which he was recovering, his spokesman said.
An oath-taking ceremony scheduled for the morning was also postponed due to his illness, his spokesman said.
In a message to parliament, the premier, appointed after the king last week first yielded to the mass demonstrations and asked the opposition to put forward a name, apologised for his failure to attend.
""I believe that I will be able to fulfill my responsibility as my health is gradually recovering,"" he said in a statement read out by the speaker.
Maoist rebel forces announced a three-month ceasefire Thursday to give the political parties a chance to bring calm to the troubled Himalayan kingdom.

The attack on Dal Bahadur Rai on Monday followed threats by the communist insurgents to harm anyone running for office in next week's municipal elections.
Rai, a mayoral candidate in a suburb of the capital, Katmandu, was in a critical condition after he was shot twice by gunmen who broke into his house then opened fire, said Roshan Karki, assistant minister for local development.
Maoist rebels have threatened ""severe action"" against candidates in the Feb. 8 election unless they withdraw from the race by Wednesday, and in recent days have been blamed for the death of one office hopeful and the abduction of another.
Karki said Rai didn't want bodyguards during the campaign, despite the threat.
""We had repeatedly offered to provide security but he refused,"" he said after visiting Rai at the hospital.
Another mayoral candidate said he was aware of the risk but refused to be deterred.
""I will go to each neighborhood, street and alley to seek votes,"" said Rajaram Shrestha.

Nepal's rebels have been fighting since 1996 to replace the impoverished country's monarchy with a socialist government. The civil war has killed about 12,000 people.
The guerrillas have intensified their assaults on government troops since they ended a unilateral cease-fire on Jan. 2, accusing the government of attacking them and of failing to also lay down arms.
The rebels and the country's seven largest political parties are boycotting the municipal elections, arguing that they would legitimize King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power a year ago.
The monarch says the takeover was necessary to fight the communist uprising and end corruption.

The hostages -- three Indians, three Kenyans and an Egyptian -- were set free by a group calling itself the Black Banners Brigade of the Secret Islamic Army (SIA) and then gave interviews on al-Arabiya television. 
The seven, who were seized on July 21, appeared happy and healthy as they spoke at length with the Dubai-based channel.
Asked how they were treated, Egyptian hostage Mohammed Sanad told Arabiya: ""They taught us religion and how to pray.""
All seven truck drivers were then whisked to the Indian embassy in Baghdad and then to the airport, a source at the embassy said.
The kidnappers declared victory, boasting that they had forced the hostages Kuwaiti employer to leave Iraq and vowing to carry out more attacks on anyone assisting US troops.
""After our demands have been met by forcing the Kuwaiti company, which is transporting goods to the infidel Americans, to withdraw from Iraq, we have decided to release the seven hostages held by us.
""We swear by God not to be merciful with those who help the occupier and we vow to strike them with an iron fist,"" the statement said.
The truck drivers' employer, the Kuwait Gulf and Link (KGL) company, announced August 27 it had decided to stop working in Iraq in response to the kidnappers' demands.
In Cairo, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Abu al-Gheit confirmed the release of an Egyptian national.

Turkish news channel NTV showed truck driver Tahsin Top being freed by his his captors. 
Top had been abducted on the road between Tikrit and Mosul, in northern Iraq, by a group identifying itself as the Abdel Kader Al-Gilani Brigade, which is part of the so-called Islamic Secret Army.

"1329",20043131,"Title: Opposition parties called general strike paralyze Nepal for second day.rtf; Date: May 12, 2004 Wednesday; Text: A crippling general strike dragged on Wednesday, putting growing pressure on Nepal's king to restore a democratically elected government.
Supporters of the strike burned tires in the capital, Katmandu, and attacked vehicles that appeared on its otherwise deserted streets.
Shops and businesses were shut for a second day as hundreds of police guarded the capital, other towns and highways. Airline flights were canceled.
The two-day strike was called by Nepal's five largest political parties, which want King Gyanendra to give up the executive powers he took two years ago when he dissolved Parliament and appointed a pro-monarchy government.
The parties want to form a new government and have a say in who should succeed Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, who resigned last week after anti-government protests.
Strikes are a common tactic in Nepal to achieve political objectives and most people comply, fearing reprisals.
The opposition stepped up its campaign to restore democracy last week when tens of thousands of their supporters took to the streets to back their demands. The demonstrations often turned violent, leading to scores of injuries and arrests.
The king assumed executive powers in 2002 and appointed a pro-monarchy government, after dissolving Parliament and firing then-Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
Deuba was accused of incompetence and of failing to end a Maoist insurgency aimed at replacing Nepal's monarchy with a communist state.
The rebels, who have been fighting since 1996, say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

Sunday's pro-democracy rallies attracted some 50,000 people across the Himalayan kingdom and were the biggest since opponents of King Gyanendra's royal dictatorship began their campaign of protests and a nationwide strike on April 6.
The strike has forced most vehicles off the highways and kept markets closed in many cities across the country. On Monday, the government said it is deploying armed escorts for trucks carrying food into the capital and offering cash incentives to drivers who defy the strike in Katmandu.
The government also forced several Katmandu service stations to open and distribute rationed gasoline and diesel. And the ban on demonstrations was extended to the outskirts of the capital and the suburb of Lalitpur, where many rallies have been held.
Sunday's biggest rallies took place in two neighborhoods outside Katmandu. One attracted 15,000 people and was peaceful. Another, in the Balkhu neighborhood, degenerated into a running battle between protesters and police.
About 10,000 people had been marching along the ring road that skirts Katmandu for hours when riot police massed to stop them. The protesters then charged the officers, who responded with a volley of tear gas and rubber bullets.
The opposition said 13 people were wounded by rubber bullets and that dozens of others were injured by baton-wielding police. About 30 people were arrested.
In Thamel, the capital's ordinarily throbbing tourist hub, dozens of shop owners, hotel workers and trekking guides burned tires and taunted police along streets lined with shuttered stores that usually sell trinkets, fabric and pirated DVDs.
""The king is killing our work, we have not enough customers,"" said C.V. Shresthra, a 36-year-old trekking guide.
Demonstrations continued Monday, with about 2,000 people marching from the suburb of Bhaktapur to Katmandu. Clerks and other workers at the Supreme Court walked out of their offices and demonstrated outside.
Many of the capital's 1.5 million residents, meanwhile, struggled to find everything from fresh vegetables to gasoline.
""I pushed my motorcycle all the way here. I have no choice but to wait for hours to get petrol,"" said Sundar Thapa as he lined up at one of the few open gas stations.
The prices for what few vegetables could be found have risen fivefold since the start of the strike on April 6, and the prices of chicken and mutton have doubled.
""We have not had a single truck come in the past 11 days,"" said Raj Maharjan, a vegetable vendor at the city's Baneswor market.
Gyanendra seized power in February 2005, saying he needed control to restore political order and end a communist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the past decade. The rebels are backing the opposition campaign.
The protests over the past two weeks have been the worst since Gyanendra's move, and the opposition sought to increase the pressure Sunday, appealing to Nepalis to stop paying taxes, custom duties, interest on loans from state banks and even their utilities.
They also urged the estimated 1.6 million Nepalese working abroad to stop sending money home. The $1.2 billion in remittances have in large part kept the economy afloat.
Tourism is Nepal's second-largest foreign exchange earner, but visitor numbers have dropped from an estimated 500,000 in 1999 to 275,000 last year.

He said: ""If the team carries out such a categorization as in the past, we will surround the supreme courts of Nepal and India and go to the International Court of Justice.""
 Bhutanese leader Rizal made the observation at a time when the Joint Verification Team is about to begin from Monday the categorization of the 2,950 Bhutanese refugees living in the Kundanbari refugee camp who were categorized as ""non-Bhutanese"" earlier by the Joint Verification Team.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1 Dec 03 p1
Rizal, while saying that it is only natural for refugees to have no identification papers with them since they always leave their country or are driven from their country during difficult times, said ""to categorize the refugees without adequate proof as non-Bhutanese is in itself an injustice"".
 ""What kind of papers should be sought from those who have been freed from prison, have undergone extreme torture and ran way to save their lives and were dumped on Indian soil?"", he counter-questioned while talking to Rajdhani. He advised that the categorization of those refugees who had been stripped of identification in Bhutan itself and then hounded out should be done through some other mechanism.
 Their citizenship could be verified on the basis of their neighbours and through a questionnaire with fixed criteria or other means, he argued.
 Since the Joint Verification Team comprises of those who were in its ranks earlier, Rizal is suspicious of its categorization process. He said: ""Since the international and refugees' representatives are not allowed to sit in the team, there is no room to be satisfied over their intention.""
 The refugees staying in the Kundanbari refugee camp appealed against their categorization by the earlier Joint Verification Team as ""non-Bhutanese"" and demanded the rights enjoyed by other Bhutanese by claiming that they were bona-fide Bhutanese. After 95 per cent of those who had been categorized as non-Bhutanese had appealed for a re-categorization, both sides agreed in the 15th ministerial-level talks held in Thimpu to carry out a re-categorization.  passage omitted

"383",20031846,"Title: India , Pakistan expel top diplomats as relations deteriorate further.rtf; Date: February 8, 2003, Saturday, BC cycle; Text: India and Pakistan cut back diplomatic representation for the second time this year Saturday, each blaming the other for deteriorating relations.
The expulsions wrecked hopes the nuclear-armed neighbors might soon begin talks to settle their perennial dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
India ordered Jalil Abbas Jilani, acting head of Pakistan's diplomatic mission in New Delhi, to leave the country and accused him of funneling money to separatists in the Indian part of Kashmir. Hours later, Pakistan expelled Sudhir Vyas, the acting Indian high commissioner in Islamabad.
The two nations also expelled four other officials from each other's embassy.
Navtej Sarna, spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs, accused Pakistan of pursuing a path of ""confrontation and compulsive hostility and brinksmanship.""
In Islamabad, Pakistani Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the expulsions were an attempt by India to derail any prospects of improved relations.
""We condemn this move, and India has proved that it does not want peace in the region,"" Ahmed said.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and nearly went to war again last year. Though they have since withdrawn many troops from their border, they continue to trade insults and have recently also been conducting missile tests.
While expulsions are not uncommon, these were the second round this year. Four diplomats from each side were expelled last month.
India and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors last year after an attack on India's Parliament in December 2001. India blamed the attack on Pakistan's spy agency and two Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups.
Intense international pressure defused much of the tension and the hostile neighbors began pulling back their armies from the border to peacetime locations in October. However, the ambassadors have not returned.
New Delhi has long accused Islamabad of backing the 12-year insurgency in Kashmir, which is divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors. Both countries claim the region in its entirety and have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.
On Saturday, India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee accused Pakistan's spy agency of also using the territories of neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh to pursue its anti-India agenda.
""For us, the most disconcerting aspect of terrorism is that it is sponsored, supported and funded by Pakistan as a matter of state policy,"" Press Trust of India quoted Vajpayee as saying at a political conference in New Delhi.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan said Pakistan wanted a peaceful resolution and quick negotiations with India to find a lasting peace in the troubled region.
""India will not find us wanting in responding to any gesture of good will,"" Khan said.

"4741",20066678,"Title: Tibetan bush fires raging near base of Mount Everest.rtf; Date: January 5, 2006 Thursday; Text: Strong winds fanned bush fires in a remote part of southern Tibet near the base of Mount Everest, the Chinese government said Friday.
Efforts by about 600 police and area residents to extinguish the flames were hampered by the mountainous terrain and water shortages, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a report issued late Thursday.
It said the fires broke out around midday last Sunday amid scrub in Tingri county, within about 50 kilometers (30 miles) of Everest, which lies along China's border with Nepal.
Flames spread over about 100 hectares (250 acres) along a 15-kilometer (nine-mile) stretch of brush and trees and reached within about 4 kilometers (2 miles) of a pristine forest reserve surrounding the foot of Everest, it said. Workers were thought to have extinguished it by midweek, but gales reignited sparks and flames were again spreading.
The area houses the main base camp for assaults on Everest made from the Chinese side of the mountain, but it wasn't clear whether any climbing infrastructure was threatened. Everest is closed to climbing during the winter months when storms and frigid weather virtually lock off the area to the outside.
The China Meteorological Administration said on its Web site it was monitoring the fire by weather satellite and coordinating with local authorities.
Calls to police and fire services in Tingri rang unanswered and a man who answered the phone at county government offices said officials had gone to the site of the fire and could not be reached by phone.

"7293",2011644,"Title: Flood-hit Bangkok in crisis mode.rtf; Date: October 26, 2011 Wednesday; Text: BANGKOK, Oct. 26 -- Bangkok's second airport shut down Tuesday as floodwaters advanced into the Thai capital, forcing authorities in ""crisis mode"" to declare a five-day public holiday in preparation for the deluge.
The cabinet ordered an October 27-31 holiday for Bangkok and 20 other provinces affected by the kingdom's worst flooding in decades, amid warnings a high tide would surge up the capital's main river and escalate the disaster.
""The government has switched to a crisis mode as a massive run-off will arrive in the capital on October 26, coinciding with a high tide on October 28,"" the Flood Relief Operations Centre (FROC) said in a statement.
In a televised address to the kingdom late Tuesday, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra gave a stark prediction of the potential impact of the flooding, saying the water was ""at full force, which is more than the barriers can hold"".
She said it was ""highly likely"" that all of Bangkok, including the inner zone, would flood, with a ""worst case scenario"" seeing water levels of up to 1.5 metres in some parts.
Her cabinet decided on the extra-long weekend at a meeting in Don Mueang airport in the city's north, which handles domestic flights and has been doubling as an evacuee shelter and a headquarters for flood relief operations.
But as the waters that have already flooded several northern and eastern districts of Bangkok closed in, airport officials announced the two runways would shut until November 1.
""Because a lot of water is creeping into the northern premises of the airport, it could cause planes to slide on the runways,"" Airports of Thailand said.
About 100 domestic flights normally operate from the airport each day.
Yingluck, who is facing her first major crisis since coming to power in August, said before the cabinet meeting that the evacuees sheltering there would also have to relocate.
The public holidays are designed to allow Bangkok's 12 million residents to brace for the floods now creeping towards the city centre after swamping other parts of the nation, killing some 360 people and damaging millions of homes.
""The public and private sectors have been urged to allow their flood-hit staff some time off, so that they would have a chance to look after their property and protect their homes,"" said the FROC statement.
Schools and government offices will be closed, but the central bank said financial markets would not shut down.
Bangkok governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra also made a televised address Tuesday warning residents along the Chao Phraya river in the capital to be on ""full alert"" after the waterway reached record highs of of 2.30 metres on Monday.
""If the situation continues in these circumstances, the water level this weekend will hit 2.60 metres, while our average flood embankment is 2.50 metres high,"" he said.
In the city centre, residents were lining up to buy bottled water directly from trucks resupplying shops, after days of panic buying emptied supermarket shelves.
Information about the floods has often been inconsistent, with politically inexperienced Yingluck apparently at odds with Bangkok's local administration, run by a rival party, and rumours of tensions with the army.
A defence official in Washington said the US navy had withdrawn several ships, including an aircraft carrier, sent to help with relief efforts in Thailand after receiving ""mixed"" messages from the Bangkok government.
""There were two channels (in the Thai government),"" the defence official told AFP. ""One was saying 'Yes' and one was saying 'No.'""
But Thailand's defence minister, General Yutthasak Sasiprapa, indicated that authorities felt they were able to handle the situation themselves.
""We have not denied their assistance, but we have our own aircraft so we would rather use ours,"" he told reporters, adding however that he was unclear over the details of the US offer and needed to check with the air force chief.
A spokesman from the US embassy in Bangkok said one ship from the US group had docked in Thailand on October 20 and its helicopters had since been on missions coordinated with the Thai army and other US agencies.
US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, on a tour of Asia, ""is closely monitoring the situation,"" spokesman George Little said in a statement.
""Thailand is a close ally, and we will continue to work with Thai officials to assess what they may need in the form of assistance from the United States,"" he added.

Devi Lal Paudel was shot dead in Butwal township, 215 kilometres (134 miles) west of Kathmandu, on Tuesday during a protest against increased fuel prices.
""All educational institutions and the market are closed while vehicles stayed off the roads in Butwal,"" Netra Panthi, a member of Butwal district's Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, told AFP by telephone.
Home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said Paudel, a pro-leftwing student leader, was hit when police opened fire to disperse unruly mobs that were attacking vehicles.
On Wednesday the home ministry appointed a judicial commission to investigate the circumstances leading to the killing.
Students in Butwal and in Kathmandu held demonstrations Thursday against the killing and the increase of fuel prices last month of between 7 and 64 percent.
Students from seven unions have said they will stage a three-day strike across the country if the government does not review the hikes.

"5685",20061484,"Title: Top rebel leader denies stalemate in Nepal peace talks.rtf; Date: October 27, 2006 Friday 5:46 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's peace process has ground to a halt but will yield results within a few weeks to resolve the Himalayan nation's decade-long conflict, the top Maoist leader has said in an interview with Kyodo News.
""There may be a pause in the process, but the underlying current is heading for a positive solution,"" Prachanda, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), said in a rare interview Thursday.
""I don't think there is any stalemate or stagnation. Because it is a very complicated and difficult problem, it will take time to resolve,"" he said.
Differences between the rebels and the seven-party ruling alliance will be sorted out within a few weeks and a vigorous bid will be made to hold the planned election for a constituent assembly next year, the bespectacled leader said.
The rebels and the political parties launched the current peace process in November last year by signing a pact to end the armed insurgency by electing a constituent assembly tasked with writing a new constitution.
""Unlike in the past, the forces that want to sabotage the peace talks are weak this time. So the chances of the talks being successful are high,"" said the 52-year-old former schoolteacher.
The insurgents will not return to the jungle for armed fighting, he reiterated. ""Now it is not necessary for us to go to an armed conflict,"" he said.
In the event of the planned election being called off, the rebels will remain in Kathmandu and launch a peaceful mass movement to hold the election, he said.
According to Prachanda, the government is saying that the arms management of the rebels is the principal issue, while the rebels are saying the major problem is political.
Changing the feudal structure, including feudal property relations, feudal culture and feudal behavior, was the main problem, he said.
He also rejected the charge that the Maoists are communists, and therefore totalitarian and dictatorial. ""We are for a multiparty system, for democracy, and for the rule of law,"" he said.
On the monarchy, the rebel leader said only Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has pleaded for a ceremonial monarchy, while the majority of the seven political parties have gone for a democratic republic.
""This monarchy, mainly this monarch and his son, have done so many bad things that our people have developed hatred for this monarch, his son and the institution,"" Prachanda said, adding there is no room for the monarchy in Nepal today.
""To have a ceremonial monarchy, a monarch has to be able to win the hearts and minds of the people. But this has not happened in the case of Nepal,"" he said.
""We have said that from the democratic point of view, we will respect any result of the masses, but we will not support the monarchy as it is today,"" he said.
The Maoists are calling for the king to be suspended until the constitutional assembly election, he explained, adding, ""We want to suspend the monarch, not to abolish monarchy and wait for a verdict of the masses.""
""If masses say we want to have a ceremonial monarchy, we will follow. Right now we are not saying that we have to abolish the monarchy,"" he said.
With the decade-long armed insurgency the rebels have uprooted the feudal system from the rural areas of Nepal, he said.
""We feel sorry for the loss of lives, the 13,000 lives or so, in the conflict. But the old state, the monarchy and governments that tried to suppress the war should bear the responsibility,"" he said.
However, differences on the question of the monarchy between the rebels and the political parties should not create problems in holding the election, he said.
""We want to take part in the election in a peaceful way...We can confine our armed cadres in camps and cantonments under the supervision of the United Nations,"" Prachanda said.
The rebels are prepared to join the interim government if there is a respectable compromise on the issue, he said.
While the government wants the rebels to disarm first before holding the election, the rebels are saying laying down their arms before the election would amount to surrender. He said Nepalese Maoists will lay down their arms following the election.
""We are committed to multiparty politics, so the fear that the Maoists will spread their ideology in the region when they come to power in Nepal is unfounded,"" he said.
The Maoist party wants to create a new political order through the election, achieve real peace and introduce a democratic change in this country, Prachanda said.
He went on to say that his party wants to create a new mainstream through the constitutional assembly elections, achieve real peace and introduce democratic change.
""We request the U.S. that they should help us create the mainstream, help us abolish the feudal setup and create a capitalistic mode of production,"" he said.
""Why not help us to set up a capitalistic mode of production and capitalist mode of culture in this country?"" he said. "" We don't understand why the U.S. and the Western world are s"

This is probably the only Ashram in the State run and controlled by women saints since its inception in 1948 by spiritual head, Shri Narayan Mahaprabhu. Present Peethadeeshwar Nirmal Narayan, taking care of the Ashram since 1979, spoke to Pankaj Mishra about some of the activities of the Ashram.
  What is the motto of the Ashram?
  The motto of the Ashram is to propagate Sanatan Dharma and enlighten the devotees. The founder of the Ashram, Narayani Devi (later known as Narayan Mahaprabhu) who hailed from Nepal renounced the world in childhood and decided to propagate spirituality. She built the Ashram to fulfill the command of her revered, learned and spiritual guru, Saint Permahansa Shri 1008 Keshvanandji Maharaj Yajurvedi.
  Tell me about the founder Shri Narayan Mahaprabhu?
  It is because of her devotion that the Ashram is in its present shape. She always emphasised on service, love and compassion for all human beings. All living beings are the creations of God and accordingly we should love and serve them. Thus, service to society is the main objective of the ashram and devotees are asked to abstain from all evils. Narayan Mahaprabhu was a true karmyogi who always preached every practitioner of religion to attain eternity through knowledge. Her aim was to make mankind happy by practising truth and non-violence. The Ashram has always been the fountain of inspiration for the people.
  Is there a need for a master?
  When the idea of duality dissolves in our minds then only we see who the master is. As I am, so is the master. He or she is part of me and I am part of him or her. There is nothing but void. It's one consciousness performing so many actions in so many forms.
  What are the social activities being run at the Ashram?
  Since the very inception it has been our effort to provide quality treatment especially to the poor who cannot afford treatment at the nursing homes. We are running a big hospital equipped with all modern facilities with special focus on cancer. Besides, Yoga programmes and Samagra-Sawasthaya schemes have been launched for different age groups. These services have been availed by the young, old and ladies and thousands have been benefited. Free medical camps for the poor people and handicapped persons are also being organised at the hospital. Apart form this, two schools of Hindi and English medium are being run at the Ashram. Both our colleges have proved to be a boon for girl students residing in nearby areas. Shri Mahaprabhu Institute of Paramedical Sciences has been established where courses of nursing, physiotherapy and other trades would be started soon. I want to start a degree college for girls in the Ashram too so that the poor and helpless can get cheaper and better education.
  Any major programme which the Ashram would be running in the near future?
  Just after Navratra festival, a week-long Shri Narayan Jayanti Mahotsava will start at the Ashram from October 13 during which Akhand Kirtan, Prabhat Pheri, Shobha Yatra and cultural programmes would be organised in the Ashram.
  Thousands of devotees across the country will be taking part in one of the biggest programmes at the Ashram. Preparations are under way for the programme.

Army spokesman Colonel Dipak Gurung said up to 2,000 armed Maoists raided the town of Bhojpur, headquarters of a district, attacked a telecommunications tower and tried to rob a state-run commercial bank.
He said 31 security personnel and at least 10 Maoists died in the overnight clash, which began about 9:35 pm (1550 GMT) Tuesday.
The rebels were prevented from taking over the town but damaged a bank and a telephone communications tower before fleeing, he told a press conference here.
Gurung said the bodies of 10 Maoists were found at the scene of the clash, including those of two women. Other bodies were carried away by the fleeing rebels, he claimed.
Security sources earlier said the fiercest fighting had occurred around the tower but that rebels had also battled the security forces in nearby areas to prevent reinforcements from reaching the site.
""The tower has been completely destroyed,"" a police official said, adding that the rebels had looted rocket launchers, self-loading rifles, semi-automatic rifles and other weapons from the security forces before fleeing.
Reinforcements had reached the area and were carrying out search operations for rebels involved in the attack, the official added.
The assault marked one of the largest attacks by the rebels since peace talks between the Maoists and the government broke down in August 2003.
Shortly after the collapse of the negotiations, the Maoists pulled out of a seven-month ceasefire with the government and renewed its so-called ""people's war"" in earnest.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed more than 9,000 lives.
The conflict has turned into one of the world's deadliest with an average of 13 people killed a day, human rights groups say.
The revolt in the nation, which sits as a buffer between India and China, is also one of the world's most brutal, with rights activists accusing both the armed forces and the Maoists of human rights atrocities.
Human rights groups say the Maoists carry out executions and kidnappings, torture prisoners, extort money, forcibly conscript fighters and use child soldiers.
They also accuse the army of secret detentions, torture and killing innocent civilians.

"396",20032395,"Title: Nepal 's PM to visit India , ask for help against Maoists.rtf; Date: November 19, 2003 Wednesday; Text: Nepal's Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa will visit India next week to seek further military assistance to combat a Maoist insurgency, officials and sources said Wednesday.
He will also visit Sri Lanka and Bhutan in his capacity as the outgoing chairman of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), officials said Wednesday.
After arriving in India on Sunday, Thapa will meet his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and other leaders, the foreign ministry said.
""Prime Minister Thapa will be seeking India's cooperation in controlling the Maoists crossing over to Nepal from India as well as transportation of arms and ammunition,"" a foreign ministry source said.
""Nepal is seeking more military assistance for combating the Maoist rebels,"" the source added.
India is Nepal's main military supplier and recently supplied two bullet-proof helicopters to help the battle against the guerrillas.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 during which more than 8,200 people have been killed.
There has been a surge in violence since the rebels pulled out of a seven-month ceasefire and peace talks on August 27.
Thapa will also discuss with Vajpayee expanding Nepalese exports to its huge neighbour and further Indian economic assistance to develop Nepal's hydropower.
India recently agreed to build a billion dollar hydropower project in western Nepal.
Thapa will also hold meetings on proposed resolutions to be approved by the SAARC summit in Islamabad in early January, particularly on economic cooperation, the control of terrorism and drug trafficking.
After his three-day visit to India, Thapa will go to Colombo where he will meet President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during his two-day stay, the source said.
Thapa will then spend two days in the tiny Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan, where he will meet leaders to dicuss SAARC, bilateral cooperation in trade and tourism and the repatriation of some 100,000 Bhutanese living in camps in Nepal.
The refugees, who are mostly of Nepalese descent, fled to the neighbouring kingdom in the early 1990s when Bhutan imposed cultural reforms that encouraged the use of its national language and dress.
Bhutan, which denies any anti-Hindu agenda, has agreed to repatriate all who were forcibly evicted but contends that most of the refugees left voluntarily.
SAARC was founded in 1985 to boost regional cooperation but has made few achievements to show mainly due to tensions between its two largest members, India and Pakistan.
A summit was to have been held in Islamabad in January this year but India failed to confirm its attendance amid tensions with Pakistan and it was cancelled.

 The goal of keeping HIV prevalence below one per cent of the total population of Nepal by 2007 is feasible with a well-found operation plan. But that requires 88.8m US dollars, a published report said Saturday 1 November .
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 1 Nov 03
The fully-funded operational plan will keep the HIV prevalence at 0.94 per cent and the HIV incident at 0.11 per cent, said a projection report presented at a workshop on HIV Advocacy and Resource Allocation in Nepal, according to The Rising Nepal.
 The projection further said 17,071 additional infections will be averted and that there will be provision for anti-retroviral medicines for 3,000.
 Of the projected allocation of the 88.8m US dollars for Nepal's national operational plan for 2003-2007, 69 per cent will be spent on targeted prevention, 21 per cent on care and support and 4 per cent on management, the daily said.
 The primary areas of focus within the targeted prevention consist of youths (39 per cent), mobile population (24 per cent), IDU, or Injection Drug Users (17 per cent), sex workers (12 per cent) and MSM, or Men having Sex with Men (3 per cent), the daily added.

"3428",20044161,"Title: Peapods baby store grew out of home business(2).rtf; Date: January 27, 2004, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: Millie Adelsheim and Dan Marshall never imagined that selling baby slings to new mothers out of their Minneapolis home would turn into a family owned business in St. Paul.
""It got to a point where the bins were taking over our house,"" said Adelsheim, 32, who began working with one baby sling distributor in California and now works with four vendors.
She said the cotton fabric slings are appealing to parents because they are comfortable and easy to use.
After having two children, the married couple decided to take their side business seriously and expand.
Today, they are the owners of Peapods Natural Toys & Baby Care, on Snelling and St. Clair avenues. The 5-year-old store is crammed with handmade wooden toys, red wheelbarrows and blue push wagons created by local craftspeople and German toymakers.
""You look at the toy and you can see how the toy was made, you can see the tree, you can see the (toy) maker,"" Adelsheim said.
Part of the store's allure is the uniqueness of the products, Adelsheim said.
""They (toys) can be whatever the child wants them to be,"" she said. ""A toy should be a tool for them to express their inner self, imagination and spirit.""
The most popular items are the baby slings; punch n' drop sets, which are wooden boxes that come with three wooden balls and a hammer; rattles and pretend kitchenware, she said.
Some of the brands she sells are made from recycled material. ""These toys are going to have a long lifespan and will not quickly end up in a landfill.""
The prices range from $10 handcrafted flower fairies to a $180 Wooden Noah's Ark. More than 2,000 toys of all types are imported from around the world including Nepal, Thailand, Europe and Guatemala. The store works with about 75 vendors.
Adelsheim said that because her store is specialized, the company's main competition comes from catalog- and Internet-based businesses.
Holiday sales were up 38 percent from the previous year. Total 2003 revenue reached $375,000, up 39 percent from 2002, she said.
At first, making a profit was difficult.
""For the first three years, everything we sold went back into the store,"" she said.
Her 33-year-old husband left his job at American Express Financial Services in Minneapolis about three years ago to help out with the Web site and marketing.
""I was basically saying, 'There's no way that I can take care of an infant child and manage a business,' "" Adelsheim said.
She also works with her mother, Jule Adelsheim, a retired schoolteacher who handles the store's bookkeeping and management. Millie handles the creative aspects of the business such as the display window and product selection.
The business does not focus on titles. Everyone chips in, including the Adelsheim-Marshall children - 7-year-old Abby and 2-year-old Riley.
They willingly share their thoughts while their two plump cats, Tombo and Gus, warm up to clients as they enter the doorway.
Most of the store's employees are mothers. Adelsheim said she wanted employees who would be able to connect with the clients - mostly parents and grandparents.
Some say natural toys are gaining popularity among parents who are tired of commercialized, mass-produced goods for children.
""They are toys that parents take an interest in and children do too,"" said Sarah Mayer, owner of  Inc. in Viroqua, Wis., an online retailer of natural material toys.
""They (parents) don't just plop their children down and expect their children to be entertained by this object,"" Mayer said. ""These are toys that they just don't pick up, get bored with them and toss them aside.""
Mayer said simple toys require more interaction than observation and are as much fun as battery-operated ones.
""The toy pulls imagination and activity out of the child that they really grow attached to it,"" she said. ""The more simple toys are the ones that are treasured and that age.""
In 2002, toy industry sales were $21.3 billion, up 1 percent from the year before. Some analysts predict another flat year for 2003, reports the NPD Group, a marketing information company based in Port Washington, N.Y.
Millie Adelsheim said owning her own business has been a lifelong dream.
""Ever since high school, I always assumed that I would be self-employed,"" Adelsheim said.
Adelsheim had a brief career as an elementary school teacher in the St. Cloud school district. But she quickly realized that creating her own business from scratch would give her a chance to be a stay-at-home mother after the birth of her first child.
""I knew my job would be something that would grow with my family,"" she said.
Her mother credits her daughter's business instincts and high spirit.
""I'm really proud to just see this store exploding,"" she said. ""When people ask about the store, I very proudly puff up and say it's my daughter's!""

 Text of report by Nepalnews.com web site on 22 July
 The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) has said it penalized six army men deployed at the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo for allegations of sex abuses there.
 Addressing a regular press briefing organized at the RNA headquarters in Kathmandu Friday [22 July], RNA spokesperson Brig-Gen Deepak Kumar Gurung said that the offenders have been recalled and sentenced to three months of imprisonment, with one of them demoted.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 22 Jul 05
On reports of the Taghandubba incident, the RNA has already formed a court of enquiry to probe the incident. ""If found guilty, the offenders will be punished,"" he said.
 In Taghandubba of Jhapa district [far east Nepal] in the first week of July, plain clothed security personnel had shot dead Rama Adhikari, 38, in front of her son on allegations of being a Maoist, reports said.
 The RNA had stated in a press statement that the ""so-called Area Committee Member of the Maoist group identified as Rama Adhikari was killed in Taghandubba of Jhapa district"". Security forces recovered one pistol and ammunition and Maoist related documents from the site, the army had claimed.
 According to the RNA spokesperson, over 4,490 Maoist insurgents had been killed in security operations since the break down of the second round of cease-fire in August 2003. He added 864 more rebels are suspected to have been killed and 364 injured on top of the above figure. According to him, a total of 508 soldiers lost their lives during this period.
 Referring to Thursday's London bomb blasts, the spokesperson appealed to the public to alert security forces of any suspicious objects and danger, like the Londoners had done yesterday, thus saving lives.

[Presenter] How is the situation in Bara?
[Reporter] It is still tense here. Occasional gunfire can still be heard. At about 1445 [local time] this afternoon, about 300 Madhesi Janadhikar Forum activists were marching towards the Survey Department and Land Revenue Office. They were replacing sign boards [of government offices] with their own graffiti declaring the offices to belong to the Madhesi government. It was in the course of these developments that they clashed with the police. One person was injured. Again, after about 1630 [local time] the demonstrators clashed with the police. One protester died and another nine, including a child, sustained injuries after the police opened fire.
[Presenter] How did the demonstrators present themselves?
[Reporter] They carried sticks in their hands and chanted various slogans. They were very agitated.
[Presenter] How did the police try to calm the crowd?
[Reporter] The police were following the demonstrators. But the demonstrators were telling them to go back and that they would do nothing untoward. They were just replacing the signboards by the government offices and as a result got involved in disagreements with the police. Several people began throwing stones at the police. This is how the situation began to develop. I have just received some reports saying that a demonstrator has snatched a policeman's rifle from him.
[Presenter] What is the situation now, after the curfew has been imposed?
[Reporter] One can hear occasional gunfire. You can also see people out in the streets, but not very many. There is one more thing. The demonstrators have set fire to two ambulances on the hospital premises when delays occurred while evacuating the injured. Gunfire can be heard around Devkota Chok [of Kalaiya]. There was gunfire also on the Adalat Road.

"5217",20066884,"Title: Nepal 's king names new prime minister, but he's ailing(2).rtf; Date: April 28, 2006 Friday 5:41 AM GMT; Text: The king named an ailing 84-year-old politician as Nepal's prime minister Thursday, hours after communist insurgents announced a temporary cease-fire to give the new government much-needed breathing room.
Girija Prasad Koirala was the choice for prime minister by the alliance of political parties behind weeks of bloody protests that forced King Gyanendra to restore democracy in this Himalayan nation. But his illness could keep him from the first session of the reinstated Parliament on Friday.
Koirala, who is taking his fifth turn as prime minister, was to have been sworn in Friday morning, but an unspecified lung problem forced the postponement of the ceremony to later in the day, said his spokesman, Gokarna Poudyal.
Koirala's illness kept him away from a victory rally Thursday in Katmandu, marring a day that began with the Maoist rebels announcing a three-month cease-fire.
The temporary truce lifted a key burden on the new government poised to take control after protests in which 15 people were killed by soldiers and police.
Although three previous rebel cease-fires have ended only in renewed war, the Maoists backed the campaign that ended Gyanendra's royal dictatorship, and political leaders were optimistic a lasting peace could be cemented.
The cease-fire ""will help bring the Maoists to the negotiating table for peace talks that could end the violent conflict,"" said Gopalman Shrestha of the Nepali Congress Democratic Party.
However, the Maoists were clear that the cease-fire is only for three months and intended to encourage the political parties to announce a special assembly to rewrite Nepal's constitution, which enshrines the monarchy as the key arbiter of power in the country.
The writing of a new constitution that could limit or even eliminate the monarchy's role is a key demand of the Maoists, who initially rejected Gyanendra's offer Monday to reinstate Parliament, dissolved in 2002, as a ruse to keep his crown.
However, they soon softened their position, calling off a blockade of cities Wednesday and announcing the cease-fire Thursday.
The moves clearly reflected a willingness by the rebels to give politicians a chance to set up a constitutional convention.
They also appear to believe the new government will give them a chance to play a legitimate public role the outlawed Maoist student wing, the All Nepal National Free Student's Union (Revolutionary), even announced a rally Friday in the heart of Katmandu.
The rebel campaign has left nearly 13,000 dead in a decade, and crushing the insurgents was one of the top reasons Gyanendra gave when he seized power in February 2005, dismissing an interim government.
After the Maoists announced their cease-fire, tens of thousands of political party supporters gathered for a previously planned rally in central Katmandu.
Waving party flags such as the red and white stripes of the Nepali Congress and the hammer and sickle of the Communist Party of Nepal crowds poured into a park, singing and chanting as they marched down Katmandu's narrow lanes.
The rally began on an angry note, however, with the crowd throwing rocks, plastic bottles and sticks at politicians after hearing Koirala was too ill to address them.
But the politicians quickly calmed the crowd, assuring them Koirala was genuinely unwell.

Leaders who addressed the gathering today said their protests would continue so long as the sovereign rights of the people were not restored to them. They said, despite their commitment to parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch, the king had chosen to take away the people's sovereign rights and that this had forced the political parties to raise a finger at the king. The leaders also warned that if the king did not act swiftly in accordance with the wishes of the people, the institution of the crown would be confined to history books for future generations to read.
 The leaders also said that they had won a small war after the government withdrew its orders prohibiting assembly yesterday, but they said they had to strengthen their movement to win the bigger battle.
 Speaking at the mass meeting, President of the Nepali Congress Girija Prasad Koirala warned the king that they would move ahead if he did not restore the people's sovereign rights.

"870",20032149,"Title: Gov't, rebels hold informal consultations on peace talks.rtf; Date: July 13, 2003 Sunday 200307130756; Text: Maoist negotiators and government representatives on Sunday held 'informal consultations' on delayed peace talks aimed at ending Nepal's seven-year-old communist insurgency.
The government held two rounds of negotiations with the rebels after announcing a cease-fire in last January, but uncertainty hovered over the third round after a new government headed by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa took office in early June.
The new government says it is keen to continue the peace talks, while the rebels say they are also committed to finding a negotiated settlement.
The insurgents are demanding that decisions taken during the second round of negotiations be implemented before they sit down for a third round.
The rebels claim the government agreed to restrict the activities of the Nepalese army as well as to release three senior cadres from government custody during the second round of talks.
'Both decisions have not been implemented so far, and it is futile for us to sit for a third round,' rebel negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara said.
During the informal consultations on Sunday, the rebels also demanded to know the formal position of the new government on the peace talks.
As the rebels have found it so far, the government's position on the peace talks is at best vague, he said.
Mahara was assisted by another rebel negotiator, Ram Bahadur Thapa, at the informal consultations, while ministers Prakash Chandra Lohani and Kamal Thapa represented the government.
The informal consultations come amid speculation that the leader of the Maoist talks team, Baburam Bhattarai, has returned underground, and that the cease-fire reached by the rebels with the previous government is on the verge of collapse.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to abolish the monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal, though they now say they would settle for constitutional monarchy and allow multiparty democracy.

"5426",20065372,"Title: Nepal enters 'new era' after civil war.rtf; Date: November 22, 2006 Wednesday 8:14 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoist rebels and central government declared a public holiday and a ""new era"" for the impoverished nation Wednesday after signing a landmark peace deal that ends more than a decade of civil war.
Maoist leader Prachanda and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala inked the accord late on Tuesday, formally bringing the rebels out of the hills and jungles and into the political mainstream.
""This moment marks the end of the 238-year-old feudal system, and it also marks the end of 11 years of civil war,"" declared Prachanda, whose nom-de-guerre means ""the fierce one"".
The leader, a 52-year-old teacher-turned-revolutionary, whose thousands of fighters control large swathes of the countryside, promised a ""new Nepal"".
Koirala said the Himalayan kingdom, one of the ten poorest countries on earth, whose tourism-reliant economy has been badly hit by the bloodshed, had ""entered into a new era"".
""The agreement has ended the politics of killings, violence and terror and started the politics of cooperation,"" the 85-year-old premier said, adding that both parties needed ""to make sure this agreement is fully implemented"".
To celebrate, government workers were told to take the day off, an elated Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula told AFP.
Under the deal the rebels -- who still feature on the US list of foreign terror groups -- are to end their ""people's war"" aimed at overthrowing the monarchy by force, join an interim government and enter parliament.
They must also place their arms and troops under United Nations monitoring, and face increased scrutiny of their activities -- which critics say include the forced recruitment of child soldiers, extortion and political assassinations.
Kapil Shrestha, a politics professor at Tribhuvan University, said now the focus was on whether the two sides could put in the hard work to implement the deal.
""The rebels are now part of the political mainstream and there is no doubt that this is a milestone. Nevertheless, the peace in Nepal totally depends on how the two sides implement the agreement,"" Shrestha said.
The UN, a key player in the process, said it now had to move fast to shore up the deal.
""I hope that we will quickly be able to reach tripartite agreement on the full modalities for the management of arms and armies,"" said Ian Martin, the personal representative of UN chief Kofi Annan in Nepal.
""The secretary general has said that he intends to move promptly to respond to the request to the United Nations to help in key areas of the peace process.""
Once foes, the multi-party government and rebels have observed a ceasefire for more than six months after they joined forces in April to organise mass protests that forced King Gyanendra to end 14 months of dictatorial rule.
The deal leaves the king on a shaky throne.
The fiercely anti-royal rebels have vowed to continue to battle -- albeit peacefully -- to consign the monarchy to history.
Some of the parties in the coalition, however, favour a ceremonial role for the king -- still revered by many as a Hindu deity. His future is set to be decided after polls next year for a body that will rewrite the constitution.
Kanak Mani Dixit, managing editor of the widely respected Himal South Asia monthly, said Gyanendra was now completely sidelined.
""He is a non-entity now. He is the most humiliated man in Asia,"" said Dixit, who joined a cheery overnight candlelight celebration.
On the streets of Kathmandu Wednesday, tea stall owner Uma Rijal looked happy and relieved that the war was finally over.
""It's a moment of rejoice. Finally the war is over, which has been long awaited by people. The peace agreement has given people a reason to smile. Now there won't be any more killings,"" Rijal said Wednesday morning as commuter traffic clogged the street next to her stall.

 'Some 17,000 Nepalese workers are already in Iraq and 35,000 others are waiting to go,' the Kathmandu Post reported.
It said Nepalese and international agents are busy supplying Nepalese workers to the war-torn country.
 'An official with an Iraq-based Canadian contract company...and a Kuwaiti national identified as Mr. Mohammed of Al-Kuwaitia Co. supplied undisclosed numbers of Nepalese workers' and the workers left for Iraq last week, the newspaper said.
 'The heavy commission and high demand among locals' have lured dozens of Nepalese manpower companies into supplying Nepalese to Iraq via Kuwait, it said.
 The government does not approve sending its nationals to Iraq, but manpower companies send Nepalese to countries such as Kuwait, Jordon and the United Arab Emirates before surreptitiously transferring them to Iraq, the newspaper said.
 The companies recruit mostly retired army personnel for what they describe as reconstruction jobs in Iraq, it said.
 Nepal maintains close relations with the United States, but has not responded to the U.S. call for sending troops to join U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq.
 The government has said Nepal will consider sending forces to Iraq only under a U.N. mandate.

The first Indian naval vessel, the INS Mumbai, entered Beirut's port and begun evacuating Indians, taking them to Larnaca in nearby Cyprus, said Assistant Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Pradeep Chauhan.
Three other ships were due to arrive in the region shortly, he said, adding it was the biggest ever civilian evacuation conducted overseas by the Indian navy.
Chauhan said they were sending in one ship at a time to minimize the risk to the vessels. The INS Brahmaputra will go in Friday, he said. India is also evacuating Nepalese and Sri Lankan citizens.
An estimated 13,000 Indian citizens are currently in Lebanon. So far more than 1,000 Indians have asked to leave and the Indian Embassy there continues to get requests, said External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna.
Chauhan said the four warships can take 1,000 to 1,200 people and if the need arises they will undertake a ""shuttle"" service to Larnaca.
""The evacuation operation will continue in the coming days as required,"" Sarna said.
Also Thursday media reports said the state-owned Air India is sending two planes to Cyprus to bring them home.

 Kathmandu, 4 September: The brutal killing of 12 Nepalis by Sunni hard-line militants in Iraq has failed to fan religious fanaticism here, with both Hindus and Muslims showing tremendous restraint, religious heads said today. Religious heads of both communities are propagating communal harmony in the wake of the worst-ever riots, which have left the city under a pall of curfew.
 At the Reporters' Club Nepal today, speakers unanimously underlined the need to forget the Iraq episode and come back to senses. ""The efforts to fan Hindu-Muslim riots have not fructified. We are still bound by goodwill and friendship,"" said Nazir Mian, chairman of the Nepal Muslim Ittehad (NMI) at the club. He appealed to the Muslim brotherhood worldwide not to do any harm to members of the Nepali community. He also condemned the instances of rioters breaking into mosques and defiling them on Wednesday.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 5 Sep 04
Chairman of the Ratna Park-based Jam-e-Masjid mosque Syed Nihal Shah said the advent of the Muslim community in Nepal dates back to seven centuries. Denying there was any religious overtone to the killings of Nepalis in Iraq, former minister Salim Miyan Ansari cited instances of Iranian militants killing even their own brethren.
 Meanwhile, chairman of World Hindu Federation (WHF) Pt Narayan Prasad Pokharel said the instances of denizens of the capital going on a rampage on Wednesday should be attributed to the inherent quality of the Nepali people whereby they do not take injustice lying down. ""Not taking the injustice heaped on them lying down was a natural phenomenon. But they went a bit too far,"" said Pt Pokharel. He also said WHF was highly concerned over the physical and emotional injuries inflicted on unsuspecting and innocent Muslims. ""We are a multi-religious and multi-cultural nation,"" he said.
 Chairman of Monastery and Development Committee (MDC) under the Ministry of Local Development Dr Tsime Tsering Lama said the killings of 12 Nepalis in Iraq should be viewed in isolation and not considered as an act of religious animosity at large.  passage omitted
 Hulas Chandra Golchha, chairman of the World Jain Council, Anubrata, argued the latest instance was an effort to destabilise Nepal. ""We must find out why such incidents occur time and again,"" Golchha said.

The dead included two policemen and a suspected Maoist militant, he told The Associated Press by telephone. The police were returning from a local school where students had taken high school board examinations. The rebels fired first, and police retaliated.
Gyawali said police had recovered at least one rebel body and were searching the area for the attackers. Army soldiers have reached the area and were helping in the search.
Rebel violence has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government last year a move the king said was necessary to quell the communist insurgency, which has left more than 13,000 dead since it began in 1996.

 The remarks made by Jamaat-e-Islami Amir and Industries Minister Matiur Rahman Nizami blaming Indian and Israeli intelligence agencies for the countrywide serial bomb attacks on 17 August is not the statement of the government or BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party], said Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan. ""Jamaat is a coalition partner of the BNP government, so his [Nizami] voice is not BNP's voice. The remarks [blaming RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) and Mosad] reflect the view of Matiur Rahman Nizami and his party,"" Morshed said at a post-China visit press briefing yesterday.
The Daily Star website, Dhaka, in English 22 Aug 05
""We need to find out the criminals … [ellipsis as published] and those who had planned the operations and we must do it because it was an attack on the Bangladeshi citizens irrespective of their religious faith and political beliefs,"" he added. Asked whether the government still denies the existence of Islamist extremists in the country, Morshed said it is too early to go into speculations on the matter as the investigation is still going on and therefore it is the best that none engages in a blame game. On the presence of international terrorists in Bangladesh, he said: ""Let the investigation complete. We all must wait and see who are responsible for it.""
 On the comments of some Indian leaders and the media, including that of Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Morshed said India's allegations are not new, ""but I will urge upon all, especially the members of the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] and regional countries to refrain from making any provocative statement.""
 In reply to another question, the foreign minister said the government will not hesitate to take foreign intelligence help, if needed, to unearth the incident. He said some 63 subcommittees were formed for the 63 districts where bombs exploded and that one committee will submit its report soon. About the government's position in this regard, he said no one will be spared whatever their political or religious affiliation may be.
 Asked if the incident will cast any negative impact on the 13th SAARC Summit scheduled for November 12-13 in Dhaka, he said: ""I don't see any reason why the SAARC Summit should be a victim of this blast."" ""Similar incidents happened earlier in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Even within weeks of the Pakistani president's life came under danger, the 12th SAARC Summit was held in Islamabad,"" he added. Morshed said the SAARC member-countries, including current SAARC Chairman and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, reassured Bangladesh of their participation in the Dhaka summit in November.
 Returning to the bomb blasts again, he said the incident was definitely done by professional hands. Asked whether he admits the failure of the intelligence agencies, Morshed obliquely replied: ""I cannot say they were successful.""
 Adviser for Foreign Ministry Reaz Rahman, Adviser for Energy Ministry and Executive Chairman of Board of Investment Mahmudur Rahman, Foreign Secretary Hemayetuddin and other high officials were present at the briefing.

""Norway and Sweden have long been preparing to support the UN effort in Darfur. We therefore regret that we are forced to withdraw our offer of an engineering unit to UNAMID,"" the foreign ministers of Sweden and Norway, Carl Bildt and Jonas Gahr Stoere, said in a statement.
The unit was to help build up Darfur's infrastructure in the early stages of the mission.
Sudan President Omar al-Beshir has objected to UN plans to include soldiers from Nepal, Thailand and Scandinavian countries in the peacekeeping force for Darfur.
""Sudan must bear the full responsibility for the situation that has now arisen,"" the ministers said.
""Norway and Sweden are being prevented from contributing to this very necessary effort, which was aimed at improving security for the people of violence-ridden Darfur,"" they said.
UNAMID took over from the African Union on January 1. Currently, most of the force comes from the 7,000 existing AU troops who have been trying to bring peace to Darfur for the past three years.
The mission, the UN's largest, will eventually consist of 20,000 troops and 6,000 police and civilian personnel, but only around 9,000 troops and police are currently in place.
The Darfur conflict began in February 2003 when ethnic African tribes rebelled against what they consider decades of neglect and discrimination by the Arab-dominated Khartoum government.
The government's response was to back the Arab Janjaweed militia and give it free rein to crack down on the rebels and their suspected civilian supporters.
At least 200,000 people have died and more than two million have fled their homes since the conflict began.

"7173",20082776,"Title: Nepal allows climbing up Everest to resume after Chinese torch ascent.rtf; Date: May 9, 2008 Friday 10:48 AM GMT; Text: Nepal allowed the climbing season on Mount Everest to resume Friday after blocking access to hundreds of climbers so that a Chinese team could ascend with the Olympic flame without any threat of protests on the mountain.
Tourism Ministry official Dinesh Adhikari said Friday that the climbers who had been waiting at the Mount Everest base camp could now depart for higher ground, lifting a nine-day ban on ascents.
Chinese climbers took the Olympic torch to the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit Thursday from the Tibetan side of the mountain. Though they were climbing from the north side, Nepal also had banned climbing on the Nepalese side to the south to prevent any anti-China protests on the mountain.
Hundreds of climbers had boxed in at the base camp since May 1, waiting for the Chinese to complete their torch relay on the mountain.
Adhikari said although the climbers were able to leave the base camp at 5,300 meters (17,400 feet) on Friday it would take a few days of altitude acclimatization before they could make their attempt on the summit, via last camp at South Col at 8,000 meters (26,200 feet).
The Nepalese government has given permission to 290 climbers from 32 expedition teams to climb the world's highest mountain during the popular spring season, which ends in a few weeks.
Climbers generally have to complete their ascents by the end of May, after which weather conditions deteriorate. Summer heat melts snow and ice making the path slippery and ground unstable, and monsoon weather from June adds to the risks.
Not wanting to hurt relations with Beijing, Nepal had imposed a strict ban on the mountain to prevent protests during the Olympic torch relay. Dozens of armed Nepalese soldiers were posted at Mount Everest's base camp and at Camp 2, a lower stop for mountaineers.
Climbers were initially not allowed to go above the Camp 2, but after May 1 they were all made to wait at the base camp, according to trekking agencies in Katmandu.
Officials forced U.S. mountaineer William Brant Holland of Midlothian, Virginia, to leave the mountain after catching him with a ""free Tibet"" banner, and he was later expelled from Nepal. A British news team also was asked to leave the base camp.
The threat of protests on Everest came from thousands of Tibetan exiles who have been living in Nepal for years. They have been holding almost-daily anti-China protests in front of the U.N. office and the Chinese Embassy in Katmandu.
About 150 Tibetan, many of them monks and nuns, protested near the Chinese Embassy visa office in Katmandu. They were blocked by Nepalese police and detained. Police official R.P. Dhamala said they were likely to be freed by nightfall.
Nepal has said it will not allow protests against any friendly countries, including China. Police have broken up almost every protest since they began in March.

"5424",20062888,"Title: Communist rebels in Nepal to end their unilateral cease-fire.rtf; Date: January 2, 2006, Monday, BC cycle; Text: Communist rebels in Nepal announced Monday they would end a four-month cease-fire, saying they had to take up arms to defend themselves against government attacks.
The rebels declared a three-month cease-fire in September, offering a chance to end a civil war that has killed more than 12,000 people. They extended the cease-fire by one month in December.
But the government has refused to negotiate with the rebels, saying it is unconvinced they are serious about bringing about an end to the conflict. It also has clashed sporadically with rebels during the cease-fire, and has referred to the militants as terrorists.
""We want to make it clear that we have been compelled to break the cease-fire to defend our fighters and resume offensives,"" said the rebel leader Prachanda, who goes by one name.
Under the cease-fire, the rebels pledged not to attack military or civilian targets but have continued to block highways, extort money and kidnap villagers for indoctrination.
The rebel announcement came despite pleas by human rights groups and Nepali political parties to extend the cease-fire, which expires Monday night. It had been widely expected to be extended again.
The rebels agreed last year to work with the country's seven main political parties to step up their opposition to the administration of King Gyanendra, who seized control of the government in February 2005, citing the need to fight the insurgency and reduce corruption.
Since then, the government has suspended civil liberties, jailed hundreds of politicians and activists, and banned criticism of the government and security forces in the Hindu nation of about 27 million people.
Nepal's political parties blamed the government for forcing the rebels to end the cease-fire.
""The government provoked the rebels to break the peace. But we will continue to urge all parties to maintain peace,"" said Arjun Narsingh of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Nepal.
The government has set a tentative date next month for municipal elections, a step toward restoring democracy. But the political parties have pledged to boycott any vote under the king's rule.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's monarchy and establish a communist state.
Neighboring India, which has criticized Gyanendra for seizing absolute power, called the rebels' decision unfortunate.
""We have consistently called upon the Maoists to abandon the path of violence and terror, accept the discipline of multiparty democracy, and work for a political settlement that contributes to the political stability and economic prosperity of Nepal,"" said Navtej Sarna, spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs In New Delhi.

The guerrillas on August 24 lifted the week-long blockade that had hit deliveries of food and fuel. 
But they threatened to resume it in another month unless the government releases information about missing rebel suspects and frees jailed ones.
A report by the Investigation Commission said that out of the 54 Maoists, 17 were in detention, seven had died in clashes with security forces and the rest had been released, according to a home ministry statement.
The Maoists' call for information has also been a key condition for resumption of a peace dialogue with the government and an end to their shutdown of dozens of companies, which has hit an already desperately poor economy.
The commission will investigate the cases of more Maoists reported missing and its tenure has been extended by a month, the statement said.
The revolt aimed at topppling the monarchy and installing communist rule has claimed at least 10,000 lives since it erupted in 1996.

Bidur, Nuwakot [central Nepal]: A senior minister has said King Gyanendra could be declared the country's last king and first president simultaneously.

"6668",2008647,"Title: Top UN official warns of risk of Sudan - Chad war.rtf; Date: February 8, 2008 Friday 9:38 PM GMT; Text: A senior UN official on Friday warned that a reported proxy war between Sudan and Chad through rebel groups on each side of their border threatened to destabilize the region and could lead to a wider conflict.
Jean-Marie Guehenno, the French head of UN peacekeeping operations, made the remarks to the Security Council as Sudanese troops attacked three communities in western Darfur, killing dozens of civilians, according to a Darfur rebel chief.
""At least 150 people from the village targeted, that is Abu Soruj, 55 kilometres (35 miles) north of Geneina (capital of West Darfur), have been killed or wounded,"" Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) commander Abdel Aziz Nur al-Asher said.
And Guehenno said the situation had been exacerbated by the violence in neighboring Chad over the past several days.""
""The potentially destabilizing regional implications have been highlighted by numerous media reports of Chadian rebel movements receiving support in Sudan ... and Sudanese rebel movements that have acted in support of the Chadian government,"" he said.
""Continuing accusations by both governments of their support for rebel movements on each side of the border increase the climate of mistrust, fuel tensions between the two countries, and once again demonstrate the potential for a conflict of international dimensions in the area,"" he added.
Guehenno, who toured troops of the UN-African Union peacekeeping force (UNAMID) in Darfur during his January 21-31 visit, also complained that the force ""is severely under-resourced for the tasks which it was mandated to perform.""
When fully deployed, UNAMID is to become the UN's largest peacekeeping operation with 20,000 troops and 6,000 police and civilian personnel.
But only around 9,000 troops and police are currently in place.
Guehenno said the world body would give priority to deploying a contingent of Ethiopian troops as part of UNAMID, provided Khartoum quickly agreed to the simultaneous deployment of crack Nepalese and Thai units.
""If we are to deploy these units alongside the Ethiopian troops, we must inform Thailand and Nepal immediately so that urgent pre-deployment preparations can be finalized,"" he added.
US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad said Washington expected Khartoum to ""cooperate fully with the upcoming deployments of UNAMID forces.""
He said Egyptian engineering, signal and heavy transport units were expected to deploy March 10, followed by Egyptian and Ethiopian infantry battalions in March and April and the Thai infantry battalion in the ""April timeframe.""
""If the Sudanese government does not deliver on these steps in a timely manner, then the Security Council will need to consider appropriate action to ensure compliance,"" said Khalilzad, hinting at possible sanctions. 
""The credibility of the Security Council is on the line,"" he added.
Khartoum has been dragging its feet on allowing key non-African forces to serve with UNAMID, arguing that the UN should turn to available African troops first.
Guehenno also bemoaned the fact that UNAMID was still lacking ""critical military aviation and ground transportation assets,"" referring to 24 attack and transport helicopters.
""The Council must be aware that, should offers for these critical capabilities not be forthcoming, additional troops will not be a sufficient substitute,"" he said.
Meanwhile, UN envoy to Sudan Jan Eliasson said prospects for quick agreements among the fragmented Darfur insurgency ""on common positions and a negotiating team appear dim.""
""The situation is running out of control. We cannot get the political talks going if we don't have an atmosphere, a climate in which talks can take place,"" he warned.
Eliasson and African Union envoy Salim Ahmed Salim visited Darfur last month to try to restart the peace process after talks in Libya failed in October.
A peace deal was signed with the Khartoum government in the Nigerian capital of Abuja in May 2006 but only one Darfur rebel faction endorsed it, sparking deep divisions and a new surge in violence.
The Darfur rebels have since splintered into dozens of factions.
At least 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war, famine and diseases and more than two million have fled their homes in Darfur since the ethnic minority rebels took up arms against Sudan's Arab-dominated regime in February 2003.

Many of the deaths in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan came from exposure or fevers and pneumonia contracted during the cold spell, officials said.
""Bonfires are the only solace for us,"" said Sukhai Ram, 30, a laborer in the northern Indian city of Lucknow. Wrapped in a filthy blanket, he had spent the night with dozens of others huddled around a public bonfire. ""Without the fires, we will die.""
Bangladesh recorded the highest death toll overnight, with 14 people dying in northern districts near the Himalayan foothills where temperatures dipped below the average of 8 degree Celsius (46 degree Fahrenheit).
Nine of those deaths came in the impoverished northern district of Thakurgaon, said relief officials who asked not to be identified because they were not allowed to speak to media.
Five other deaths were reported in the neighboring districts of Dinajpur and Ishwardi, reported the Bhorer Kagoj newspaper.
A total of 40 people have died in Bangladesh since the cold wave began about a week ago.
Most Bangladeshi villagers live in mud-and-thatch huts and are ill-prepared for colder-than-normal weather, and relief workers said they were handing out blankets and warm clothes, as were authorities in stricken parts of neighboring India.
In India's worst-hit Uttar Pradesh state, at least 12 people died overnight, bringing India's death toll to 144, said Surendra Srivastava, a police spokesman in Lucknow, the state capital.
Dilip Kumar, a 32-year-old construction worker in Lucknow, said his family had ""arranged for our own bonfire to keep warm at night. If we can't find wood from scavenging, we burn rubber tubes to ward off the biting cold.""
In the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana, at least 15 people have died because of the cold since November, while another eight deaths have been reported over the last two weeks from the state of Jammu-Kashmir.
Schools have been ordered closed across northern India until the cold wave lifts.
In neighboring Pakistan, at least 47 people have reportedly died of cold and pneumonia from a week of frigid weather in the country's remote northern Himalayan region.
The region is outside areas hit by a giant Oct. 8 earthquake that killed at least 87,000 people.
The World Health Organization last week reported 18 cold-related deaths in the quake zone over the previous six weeks.
With temperatures dropping to minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) in some mountain areas, Pakistani officials and aid workers fear the harsh cold and snow could trigger a second wave of deaths among hundreds thousands of people who have been living in tents since the quake.
Anecdotal reports suggest many more may have died, although the deaths have not been tallied by authorities, in part because some areas are inaccessible.
In Nepal, meanwhile, at least three people died Sunday from the cold in Janakpur, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of the capital, Katmandu, said Umesh Pokhrel, a government official. He had no information on how many people have died so far in the Himalayan kingdom.
The cold also left wide swaths of India and Bangladesh shrouded in dense fog, disrupting road, rail and air traffic on Tuesday.
The meteorology departments in India and Bangladesh that the cold spell, worsened by chilly northwesterly winds, would last until the end of the week.

At least two dozen policemen and protesters were injured as police charged with bamboo batons and demonstrators retaliated by throwing bricks. Police then bundled about 400 of the protesters into cargo trucks at the main market area of Katmandu.
Monday marked the 18th straight day of protests against King Gyanendra's October 2002 dismissal of an elected government and its replacement with one loyal to the monarchy.
Since then, thousands have frequently rallied across the country to demand polls and the restoration of Parliament. Some of the protests have turned violent.
On Monday, about 10,000 people marched waiving red-and-white party flags and chanting ""We want democracy, we want our rights.""
Hundreds of policemen had been stationed around the city to quell the protests. The detainees were taken to police stations where they would be questioned and freed, said one police official at the scene.
The demonstrations are being organized by the country's five largest political parties, including the Nepali Congress and the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal to demand that King Gyanendra restore the country's elected government.
The king dissolved Parliament and fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in October 2002, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control a Maoist insurgency. He then assumed executive powers and replaced the government with pro-monarchy politicians.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 for a communist state. More than 9,000 people have been killed in the rebellion.
The king promised last month to hold parliamentary elections within a year, but that move has failed to quell the demonstrations. The latest string of protests began on April 1 and organizers have vowed not to stop until their demands are met.

The London-based rights watchdog said Nepali police had ""gone beyond what is acceptable use of force"" in tackling a blockade of Kathmandu by demonstrators on the main road between the capital and the Indian border.
Leaders of southern Nepal's Mahadhesi community, who are demanding federal powers, have been blocking the highway -- the main corridor for most of the landlocked country's imports -- for more than a week.
The strike has left Kathmandu critically low on fuel.
""At times the police showed restraint when faced with crowds throwing stones, but in other cases the police appear to have used disproportionate and excessive force,"" Amnesty said.
At least two people have been killed in the latest clashes in the south, and Amnesty International said one of them died when police fired on a group of demonstrators.
""The government must immediately send clear instructions to the police only to use proportionate force, conduct an independent and impartial inquiry into the police killing and beatings, and prosecute any police officers who are suspected of having used excessive force against protesters,"" Amnesty said.
The group also called on the protest organisers ""to ensure their members and supporters show due restraint and responsibly exercise their right to peaceful protest.""
The Terai lowlands are home to about half of Nepal's 27 million people, and the residents of the region -- the Mahadhesis -- have long complained of being excluded from politics.
Demands for more political say have mounted in the wake of a 2006 peace deal between mainstream Kathmandu parties and Maoist rebels, which the Mahadhesis say has again failed to address their grievances.

Text of report by Pakistani newspaper Dawn website on 5 January
Pakistan's media remained critical and vibrant during the year 2005, but are being ""entrapped in an elaborate system of self-censorship"". This was observed in a report titled ""Media Monitor South Asia 2005"" released by the South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA) here on Wednesday [4 January].
Generally, says the report, the Pakistani media have kept their independence, the plurality of opinions and their critical bite.
""Yet, the investigative journalism is being guillotinized [as published]. The revival of press advice, enforcement of self-censorship through various means from within and withdrawal of or threat to withdraw public sector advertisements is increasingly circumscribing media freedom.""
Encroachments take place ""as the media czars willingly barter media freedom with financial gains,"" according to the report.
During the year, most significant violations of press freedom took place and certain journalists famous for their bold stories and opinion came under fire. Journalists were attacked in the Waziristan tribal belt where army is operating against foreign and local militants linked to Al-Qa'idah.
Three journalists lost their lives while trying to perform their duties. Mir Nawab Wazir and Allah Noor Wazir, were shot dead, after participating in a truce ceremony between the government and a tribal chief Baitullah Mehsud.
Another journalist, Ubaidullah Azhar in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province], was killed but the motive behind his killing was not clear. Hayatullah Khan, a reporter for Ausaf, Nation and the European Press Photo Agency from the tribal area, was kidnapped and his whereabouts were still not known.
In 2005, the electronic media, especially FM stations, received 'guidelines' on what to do and what not to do and faced threats, seizure of equipment. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) took punitive measures against the electronic media.
Amendments to the PEMRA Ordinance 2002 passed by the National Assembly are described by the report as ""even worse"". The Senate has sent the amended bill to a committee which has yet to give its opinion. ""The move shows the real authoritarian designs behind the PEMRA which wants extraordinary powers to confiscate equipment, cancel licences and proceed against the owners,"" says the report.
Media scene in South Asia as a whole remained quite diverse in 2005, with electronic media dominating the scene, despite obstructive regimes, and Nepal and the Maldives proving to be worse places in terms of repression against the press, the report said.
SAFMA Secretary-General Imtiaz Alam, releasing the report, lamented harassment of journalists in the region, particularly in conflict-ridden and lawless areas.
Twelve journalists were killed, some kidnapped and many harassed in South Asia in 2005, he said.
In India, the report says, the media scene is becoming almost chaotic and increasingly varied with corporate interests now setting the nature of content and direction of policy. ""Yet the expansion and diversity of huge Indian media is so dynamic that no one can stop their march,"" it asserts.
The Media Monitor also included country reports on Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

 Royal Nepali Army (RNA), for the first time, officially confirmed on Thursday 26 February that Matrika Yadav and Suresh Ale Magar, two top Maoist leaders caught in India, are now under the government's control.
 ""They (Yadav and Ale) are under the control of His Majesty's Government,"" RNA spokesman Col Deepak Gurung told a regular press meet on Thursday.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 26 Feb 04
Gurung, however, declined to confirm whereabouts of the two rebel leaders. ""We cannot say where they have been kept for security reasons,"" he said.
 Yadav and Ale were arrested by Indian police in Lucknow and were extradited to Nepali authorities a few days ago. Yadav was the chairman of the newly formed ""Madhesi autonomous region"", while Ale belonged to the intellectual circle of the Maoists.
 According to media reports, troops have confined Yadav and Ale somewhere in an army camp in the mid-western region under foolproof security.
 Human rights organizations and, recently, Nepal Bar Association were critical of the government for not making whereabouts of the two Maoist leaders public.
 On RNA's role in the general elections which, according to the prime minister, will be held in October 2004, RNA spokesman Gurung said they are ""unaware"" of the matter.
 ""We have not received any official letter from the government with regard to the elections,"" he said.
 On allegations that the army killed three individuals in Jugedi, Chitwan recently, he admitted that the dead were ""civilians"". ""The army personnel on duty took action against the three, as they showed some suspicious activities,"" he said, adding that the matter is still being investigated and the victims' families would get ""proper"" compensation from the government.

 Kathmandu, 18 August: Exactly a year ago, Maoist ""suspended"" peace talks with the government at Hapure of Dang District mid west Nepal . The government had not expected them to return for negotiations soon. ""Because they were under pressure from RIM Revolutionary International Movement "" the then Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa said during a special conversation with Kantipur, ""they were not ready for talks"".
 International Maoist organization Revolutionary International Movement, or RIM, just three days before the talks collapsed had congratulated the Maoists during an underground meeting in India for ""the evergreen revolution to have reached heights in Nepal"".
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 Aug 04, p 1
""The RIM had concluded that the revolution in Nepal was becoming successful as it had failed in other parts of the world,"" Thapa said. He said: ""The Maoists agreed to their advice that there must be a fight to the finish.""
 That is why the Maoists came with a policy of ""not opposing the talks, attend the peace talks, but not negotiate"". Thapa narrated his experience in dealing with the Maoists and said: ""We too said it is just a proposal, we can reach a final decision after negotiations. But they were not ready to discuss anything.""
 He said many of the proposals put forward by the government on socioeconomic reforms were far more advanced than the Maoists were seeking. The government was ready to discuss even the provision of the constituent assembly, he said.
 ""We proposed the redrafting of the constitution as the bottom line and tried to impress upon them that it was but a proposal on the list of dialogue. Even then they were not ready to discuss anything because they were under pressure,"" Thapa said. But will they come for peace talks now? The situation could have changed in one year, was Thapa's analysis.
 Speaking during an interview for the first time since his resignation three months ago, the former prime minister said he believed the Maoists could come for dialogue mainly due to pressure from America and India. ""Maoists understand that if Nepal and India reach full agreement, then the circumstances would change.""
 He says the training of Nepalese army and police personnel, the arrest of several senior Maoist leaders and their extradition during the period was a positive indication. ""India has indicated that they are will to go to any length,"" he said. ""Similarly, the Americans are giving continuity to their policy despite the change of ambassador.""
 If the government is to hold secret talks with the Maoists now, form a peace secretariat by involving specialists and experienced people, then peace talks were possible Thapa said and stressed on the need to find full agreement and understanding with India. ""Even if the Maoists have said anything about India, they have maintained a hostile attitude towards America. This is their strategy,"" he said ""For Maoists, India too is becoming equally dangerous.""
 But he said full agreement with India was still a long way off. ""The full required agreement with India has not happened."" He added: ""At the moment, the place where Maoists take shelter, buy ammunition is India, and smuggle through the border.""
 Thapa also said that India had stopped bargaining or putting forward conditions to help in such matters and added that the possibility of further exchanges between Nepal and India had increased due to the worsening Maoist problem. But Thapa said the situation in the country had still not reached a stage where Indian goodwill could be fully utilized. ""There are still ups and downs in the way Nepalese view India. Under these circumstances, they (India) cannot be fully open to us,"" Thapa said.
 On the Maoist call for United Nations mediation, former Prime Minister Thapa said although UN assistance could be sought to establish contact, there should be no third party meditation during peace talks. ""If we did not have a common border with India, if the Maoists did not take shelter there and they were concentrated in Nepal, then there could be no role for India,"" he said ""But they are bringing in weapons from India. Without taking India into confidence, we cannot reach any decision whether we allow American, British of UN mediation.""

Text of report by Nepalese radio Kantipur FM on 16 January
[Presenter] Senior politicians and representatives of human rights groups have said that political parties must play a constructive role in the absence of a cease-fire. 
Speaking at a programme in the capital today, the secretary-general of the Nepali Congress, Ram Chandra Paudel, said the political parties must be more sensitive and constructive at a time when the cease-fire has been broken by the Maoists. Stating that the problems facing the country should be resolved through talks, he accused the government of being responsible for the break down in the cease-fire. He also claimed that the Maoists had resumed their violent activities because the government had shown indifference towards the 12-point agreement between the Maoists and the seven opposition parties.
Central Committee member of the Nepali Congress Narahari Acharya said that no party had the licence to kill anyone in the country. He said a political movement should not target individuals and he called on the Maoists to live up to the spirit of the 12-point agreement with the opposition parties. Standing committee member of the CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist] Yubaraj Gyawali said it was time the Maoists corrected their past mistakes and implemented the principles of the 12- point agreement.
Likewise, representative of human rights organizations Purusottom Dahal claimed that the Maoists were fighting the government by climbing on the shoulders of the opposition parties. He said the opposition parties must now decide whether they want to be the ladders for the Maoists to achieve their objective.

"2824",20043872,"Title: Jordan pledges to help France over hostage crisis.rtf; Date: August 31, 2004 Tuesday 7:12 PM GMT; Text: Jordan pledged Tuesday to help France secure the release of two journalists held hostage in Iraq, who are facing the imminent expiry of an ultimatum by their Islamic kidnappers.
King Abdullah II told visiting French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier his country would step up its efforts and contacts in Iraq to help save newsmen Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot.
His comments came as an Al-Qaeda-linked Sunni Muslim militant group in Iraq announced on its website the execution of 12 Nepalese hostages.
""Jordan will step up its efforts and its contacts with the concerned Iraqi parties to help guarantee the release of the French journalists abducted in Iraq,"" state-run Petra news agency quoted the king as telling Barnier.
The monarch added his voice to widespread international condemnation of the kidnapping, saying ""it reflects the violation, by some, of morals, values of goodness and justice, which are the basis of Islam"".
Barnier, on an emergency mission to save the two men, earlier agreed with Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Moasher on a ""mechanism"" to coordinate their efforts.
Moasher told reporters Jordan initiated conctacts with Iraqi groups and organisations to help solve the hostage crisis.
""We already started these contacts through the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.
""We have agreed to coordinate these issues with the French embassy hopefully until the release of these hostages,"" Moasher said. ""There is not much time but I hope we will obtain positive results.""
Jordan has ""developed contacts with many people and organisations that have contacts with some of these groups"" following the abduction of several of its nationals in recent months, Moasher said.
Thanks to these contacts, Amman was able to secure the release of eight Jordanians kidnapped in July and August.
Barnier later headed back to Egypt for separate talks with German counterpart Joschka Fischer, who is on a regional tour, and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei.
It was unclear where he would head next, although an Arab diplomat said Barnier was scheduled to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak early Wednesday in the Mediterraean port city of Alexandria.
A Mubarak spokesman said Egypt would ""use all of its contacts with tribal and religious leaders in Iraq to secure the release of the two Frenchmen as well as Egyptian hostage Mohamed Ali Sanad"".
Barnier visited Egypt Monday and spoke with Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Soleiman before moving on to Jordan as he fiercely campaigned for the two newsmen's release.
Chesnot and Malbrunot went missing in Iraq on August 20.
Their kidnappers, a Sunni Muslim group calling itself the Islamic Army of Iraq, gave France a 48-hour ultimatum to revoke a controversial law banning Islamic headscarves from state schools but have extended its ultimatum by 24 hours to Tuesday night.
""Failure to revoke it might cost us our lives. It's a question of time -- maybe minutes -- before we are among the dead,"" Chesnot said in a video broadcast on Al-Jazeera television Monday evening.
Barnier's mission to Amman came as French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin prepared to preside over a ministerial crisis meeting in Paris and President Jacques Chirac, on a visit to Russia, renewed an appeal for the release of the newsmen.
France, one of the most vocal opponents of the US-led war in Iraq, has refused to yield to the kidnappers' demands to budge on its decision to impose from Thursday a ban on ostentatious religious insignia in state schools.
It has won strong support from Muslim leaders across the world and its own five million strong Muslim community, which condemned the abduction as un-Islamic and stressed it should not be linked to the French law.

Text of report by VOA News.com website on 17 March
U.S. international radio broadcasts to Tibet will increase by four hours daily beginning tonight [17 March] at 6:00 p.m. EDT, 6:00 a.m. local time in Lhasa [2200 gmt].
""The violent crackdown by Chinese authorities in Tibet compels us to increase our broadcasts,"" said James K. Glassman, Chairman of the BBG[ Broadcasting Board of Governors], which oversees all non-military U.S. international broadcasting including the Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Asia (RFA). ""Our audience clearly will benefit from these trustworthy sources of news and information, which differ sharply from Chinese government sanctioned broadcasts.""
At present RFA broadcasts eight hours daily to Tibet via shortwave radio. VOA broadcasts four hours daily, also via shortwave. Each will expand radio programs by two additional hours daily. VOA will also double its weekly Tibetan-language television programming from one to two hours via the AsiaSat 3 satellite.
""RFA's Tibetan service is working around the clock to bring authoritative, breaking news to the Tibetan people. These additional hours will greatly enhance our capacity to deliver this news, including live updates, to people on the ground,"" RFA President Libby Liu said.
Tibet's media is tightly controlled and most Tibetans are deeply suspicious of Chinese domestic media coverage. BBG audience research, while limited to Tibetan refugees in Nepal, indicates that VOA and RFA are among the most well known foreign broadcasters and an important source of information in a society where word of mouth is the top way to share news.
""We know from experience that Tibetans will tune to VOA at pivotal times such as these,"" said Danforth Austin, Director of the Voice of America. ""For example, a VOA special TV program about the Dalai Lama receiving a gold medal from the U.S. Congress was recorded and widely distributed in Tibetan regions inside China.""

The Maoists have ordered traffic not to enter Kathmandu, sending prices of food essentials soaring in the city of 1.5 million people even though hundreds of trucks continue to enter and leave daily with military protection.
The government has been in contact with pro-Maoist students in a bid to end the blockade, a cabinet official said. The students have been demanding the release of allegedly missing colleagues and threatening to add to the chaos by calling a strike at Kathmandu's universities.
""We have told the students that we will come to the negotiating table with you provided you insist that your sister organisations withdraw the blockade,"" the official said.
He said Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was meeting Tuesday with his cabinet to decide whether to concede a major demand for ending the blockade: that the government stop calling the rebels terrorists.
The classification has kept underground the leadership of the guerrillas, who want to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist state.
Repeated government appeals to the Maoists to end the blockade, the last one made Monday by Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari, have fallen on deaf ears.
Padma Ratna Tuladhar, who was a go-between for the Maoists and government in failed peace talks last year, called the government's appeals over the past week a ""gimmick.""
""The government has not even met a contact person from the Maoist side,"" Tuladhar said, adding that the rebels were unlikely to respond to statements broadcast over state-run radio.
Opposition politicians and industrialists have been demanding the government go further to end the mayhem by declaring a unilateral ceasefire with the Maoists to halt the war that has claimed some 10,000 lives.
But the government has refused and previously said it would only consider Maoist demands during peace talks.
The United States said Monday that foreign support was key to defeating the rebels, who are strongly anti-American.
US State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said: ""Clearly we see them as insurgents that need to be defeated.
""We think it's important that other countries work with Nepal towards this end.""

More than 100 guerrillas were killed and 37 captured on the first day of the operation Friday, according to an Iraqi official. The military said one American soldier was killed and four were wounded after some 5,000 swept in to seize the city hall, the main mosque and other key sites in Samarra.
With U.S. and Iraqi officials saying they control 70 percent of the city, the Iraqi defense minister claimed success. ""It is over in Samarra,"" Hazem Shaalan told the Arab television station Al-Arabiya.
Meanwhile, in the latest in Iraq's string of kidnappings, militants claimed to have abducted and beheaded an Iraqi construction contractor working on a U.S. base.
Another group said it had kidnapped 10 hostages - six Iraqis, two Lebanese and two Indonesian woman. It demanded the release of a hardline Indonesian cleric imprisoned in his home country, but the cleric - Abu Bakar Bashir - demanded the militants release the woman and rejected any release as a result of kidnapping.
In other violence, car bombs in the cities of Fallujah and Mosul wounded at least three U.S. soldiers, and U.S. troops battled Shiite militants in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City in fighting that wounded another American. The military said Saturday that a U.S. soldier was killed the night before in Baghdad by small arms fire.
Samarra, 60 miles northwest of Baghdad, appeared mostly calm Saturday - except for in the center, where American snipers on rooftops fired at anybody appearing in the streets below. Residents in outlying areas emerged from their homes for the first time to survey the damage.
Many bodies were strewn in the street but could not be collected for fear of the snipers, while others were buried in people's gardens, residents said. A 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew was in effect, and water and electricity services were severed.
AP Television News reported that some residents could not take their wounded for treatment because of gunfire from American troops, who along with Iraqi forces were arresting any persons above the age of 15 being taken to at least one hospital.
""Dead bodies and injured people are everywhere in the city and when we tried to evacuate them, the Americans fired at us,"" one ambulance driver told APTN. ""Later on they told us than we can evacuate only injured women and children and we are not allowed to pick up injured men
Wounded people, mostly women and children, lay on beds at the Tikrit Teaching Hospital.
""His pregnant mother was killed,"" said one man, Sami Hashem, standing over a young boy whose belly was covered in bandages. Nearby was a young girl who lost her left foot.
Shaalan, the defense minister, said Iraqi forces carried out the lion's share of the fighting and U.S. troops ""only provided cover for our operations."" He said up to $40 million was being allocated for reconstruction and compensation to residents of the embattled city.
It wasn't known if the Samarra offensive marked the launch of major military operations to wrest other areas of the country from insurgents ahead of the elections set for late January.
The cities of Ramadi, Samarra and Fallujah form part of the Sunni heartland, where resistance to the U.S.-backed government has been the fiercest. Baghdad's Sadr City, a stronghold of Shiite militiamen, is also on U.S. commanders' hit list.
It is feared that inability to stage balloting in the so-called Sunni Triangle would severely mar, or even invalidate, election results.
Analysts in the United States said an offensive into Samarra was also a way to give Iraqi forces some needed combat experience before they consider taking on Fallujah, which Secretary of State Colin Powell last week called ""the tough one.""
But Pentagon officials and defense analysts have said a U.S. military offensive into difficult-to-capture cities might still be delayed, or avoided altogether, if the United States and Iraq decide to settle for partial participation in elections.
A U.S. offensive against Fallujah in April killed hundreds of people - including many civilians, according to local doctors - and raised popular outrage across the country against U.S. forces. After three weeks, the Marines pulled back and the insurgents' hold on the city tightened.
The U.S. military believes many suicide bomb attacks and kidnappings are launched from the Sunni Triangle, especially out of Fallujah, which has seen weeks of ""precision strikes"" aimed at al-Zarqawi's followers.
Qasim Dawoud, Iraq's minister of state for national security, told a news conference Friday that more than 100 insurgents were killed in the Samarra fighting and 37 others captured, including members of Saddam Hussein's deposed regime.

Kathmandu, 18 March: Members of the French police team that arrived here yesterday have started another search for missing French tourist Celine Henri Saturday morning [18 March].
French tourist Celine Henri and German Sabine Ursula Gruneklee went missing in the Nagarjun forest on 3 September and 15 October respectively. Although Gruneklee's body was found in the forest a month ago, no traces have been found of Celine Henri. 
The French police have been searching and questioning locals with the help of a team from Valley Crime Investigation Section. According to security officials, the French team comprises of six members led by the police commissioner.
It is reported that the French team, that is going to be here for two weeks, will be working with Nepal police on the case from different angles. [passage omitted]
After examining Gruneklee's body for one and a half weeks, medical experts and the police had declared that she had been killed on the very day she went missing. 
French tourist Henri's family had notified the embassy in Kathmandu in October itself. Henri hadn't been in touch with her family since 3 September. She had left all her belongings at Hotel Pilgrims in Thamel, where she had been staying, and set out for Nagarjun forest on the same day.

One day in November, Mukesh Ambani decided to say ""I have differences with Anil"" to a television channel.The biggest business/family feud in the history of corporate India was out in the open.
  The five words were just the beginning. Internal e-mails were leaked by one side and then the other. One camp said that it had been sidelined surreptitiously.
  The other responded by saying Reliance's late patriarch, Dhirubhai Ambani, had settled ownership issues in his lifetime. As one side accused the other of making questionable investments, the other raised tricky corporate governance issues. There were even stories about the authenticity of one of the brothers' MBA degree. It was as if Reliance was in self-destruct mode.
  At no time did the brothers actually attack each other openly. Yes, they were washing their dirty linen in public, but they had left the job to the battery of spin doctors they each command to engineer the leaks and sow the plants.
  Corporate India was shocked - but not surprised, there were rumours that all wasn't well in the family. Within Reliance, heads rolled - and, in some cases, 'unrolled'. Shareholders were bewildered - Reliance's stock fell, though the market crossed the 6,000 point mark. As for the rest of us, we just watched as this fascinating story unfolded.
  The reasons we did that are many. Take the group itself. It has revenues of Rs 99,000 crore. That's approximately equal to the combined GDPs of Sri Lanka and Nepal and 3.5 per cent of India's GDP.
  Something of that size affects everybody - even in a country of one billion people.
  Reliance is also everywhere. From fuel to telephones to mutual funds to insurance to textiles - and lately, even politics. If one brother meets Sonia Gandhi, the other is a Samajwadi Party backed MP.
  People have speculated as to exactly what caused the rift. Is the battle for control of the company a result of several other differences between the brothers? Like their politics, for instance, their contrasting personalities - flamboyance versus reserve - or the word that their wives aren't the best of friends?
  Given the way the story is being scripted - chapters of oblique accusations followed by more of the same - we might well get the book in 2005.
  What we are also likely to get is a clear winner in the battle of the brothers. This is a zero sum game. Only one brother will control Reliance. But before that, there will be a bit of give and take - relinquishing a few thousand crores in shares here, or control of a company there. A few more surprises are assured in further installments of the story. As are at least as many shocks.

The president of Nepal Bankers' Association [NBA] Radhesh Pant said that if the threat of extortion continues, banks may be compelled to shut down their branches one by one.
Reacting to the news report that the Himalayan Bank Ltd shut down its Banepa branch after the local Maoists demanded 1m rupees as donation, Pant said the NBA has been consistently appealing for a complete halt to such forced donation.
Although he did not say the extortion campaign in the banks was rampant, Pant hinted that the bankers were getting frustrated with the intimidation. 
""We have a big responsibility to our clients and depositors. Whatever we do, we have to do in a transparent manner,"" he said, indicating that the banks cannot pay donations in a secret manner.
Pant said the NBA has already apprised the finance minister and home minister about the problems faced by the banks. ""If again the problem persists, the banks have no option other than shutting down their branches,"" he added.
In recent weeks, Maoists have stepped up what they claim to be ""voluntary donation"" raising campaigns. A few days ago, hoteliers had also threatened to shut down hotels if the Maoists continued to demand huge donations and impose forced unionization. [passage omitted]

Deuba came to power in July 2001 and immediately entered a ceasefire with the Maoists. But the truce collapsed within four months after talks deadlocked and the rebels launched a flurry of attacks against security forces and civilian installations.
The failure of the 2001 truce prompted the king to deploy the army against the rebels for the first time. Deuba for the rest of his term said he felt personally betrayed by the Maoists' rejection of talks and vowed to crush their rebellion.
While the royal-appointed government reached a new truce with the Maoists in January this year, the peace process again looks on the verge of collapsing after the rebels Sunday gave a three-day deadline for an agreement on an assembly to rewrite the constitution.

"4220",20051122,"Title: At least 53 killed, 72 wounded in bus blast in southwest Nepal.rtf; Date: June 6, 2005 Monday 1:51 PM GMT; Text: At least 53 people were killed and 72 wounded in southwestern Nepal when a powerful bomb ripped Monday through a crowded passenger bus in one of the bloodiest attacks on civilians by suspected Maoist rebels since their revolt began nine years ago.
An army officer told AFP the bus was torn apart by the force of the blast and that the passengers were badly mutilated by shrapnel as well as by shards of metal and glass from the bus.
""(The bus) rose into the air ... quite high and came down and split into two,"" the officer said, quoting witnesses.
State radio and officials gave the death toll as 53 but warned it could rise.
The radio report, quoting police superintendent Surendra Bahadur Shah, said that 16 seriously injured people had been transferred to hospitals in Kathmandu for treatment.
Shah said the attack was the work of ""terrorists"", a word which the police and military in Nepal use to describe Maoist rebels.
Officials said many of the victims were women and children, and that three military personnel on their way home for vacation were among the dead.
The blast occurred at Madi village in the Maoist-controlled district of Chitwan, about 180 kilometres (113 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, early on Monday morning.
The military has cordoned off the scene so that medics and family members could search for items that could prove helpful in identifying some of the victims, officials said.
Search operations for the culprits were also under way throughout the district, they said.
Witnesses at the scene of the blast said the explosion left a hole in the dirt road five-feet across. The charred and twisted bus had been pulled into a nearby field.
An army officer in Chitwan district, who declined to be named, said that a home-made bomb planted in the road was used by the suspected rebels to blow up the bus.
""As the bus came near, the improvised explosive device was set off by remote control,"" he said.
""The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated or blown to pieces by the explosion,"" another officer told AFP.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Maoists, who have been fighting to install a communist republic in Nepal since 1996. The insurgency has already claimed more than 11,000 lives.
The rebels are generally not known for launching indiscriminate bombings of civilian targets, although they have been accused by human rights groups of the torture and murder of villagers they believe to be collaborating with the armed forces.
The Maoists have stepped up their campaign through road blockades and attacks on troops since King Gyanendra sacked the coalition government, imposed a state of emergency and assumed absolute power on February 1, saying it was necessary to tackle the insurgency.
Army spokesman Brigadier General Dipak Gurung said last month the security situation in Nepal was ""definitely better today"" than before the king sacked the government for failing to control the Maoists and hold elections.
""We are able to focus more on our main job"" of fighting the insurgency rather than containing civilian disturbances, said the general.

"7545",20113786,"Title: All 19 killed in Buddha plane crash.rtf; Date: September 26, 2011 Monday; Text: KATHMANDU, Sept. 26 -- A 9N AEK-B190 Beechcraft of Buddha Air hit a tree and then crashed into Kotdanda hill of Bishankhunarayan-2, Lalitpur district, at 5,400 feet Sunday morning leaving all 19 on board dead.
Among those killed are 10 Indians, three Americans, a Japanese, and two Nepali nationals, apart from three Nepali crew members. While 18 died on the spot, Niranjan Karmacharya, a passenger who was rescued alive by locals from the wreckage, died in the course of treatment at B & B Hospital.
The aircraft had left Kathmandu at 6:49 am for mountain flight. It was returning to Kathmandu following zero visibility of Mt Everest when it lost contact with the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) tower at 7:31 am and then crashed.
A Tara Air Pilatus aircraft that was flying from Lukla to Kathmandu and was tailing the Beechcraft first reported the crash to the airport tower at 7:50 am, according to Bimalesh Karna, Air Traffic Control (ATC) manager at TIA.
But confirmation of the crash came only at 8:50 am from the police and locals who had reached Kotdanda by then.
The aircraft's black box, or Flight Data Recorder, has been recovered from the crash site.
What happened?
According to ATCs at the airport, the aircraft flew two additional miles south of the airport and was at the wrong elevation for that point. This led to the crash.
""The pilots were asked to fly four miles south of the airport tower and align with the runway for landing,"" said Karna.
""But the crew flew the plane six miles south of the airport tower. The right elevation for that point is 6,500 feet. But the plane was at 5,400 feet, which was wrong for six miles south of the tower,"" he said. The elevation would have been right had the plane been flown just four miles south of the tower.
In September 1992, a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed at Bhattedanda, located nine miles south of the airport tower killing all 167 on board.
Raj Kumar Khatri, resident of Lamatar VDC, and an eyewitness of Sunday's crash, saw the Buddha Air Beechcraft fly just about 200 meters above him.
""There were some branches on top of the plane's front. The plane had already lost balance. By the time we overcame our surprise over the low elevation of the plane, it crashed at Kotdanda hill in front of our eyes,"" Khatri said.
Though Sunday's visibility cannot be called poor, hanging clouds on the Valley's sky were repeatedly enveloping the aircraft, which could have led to human error as the plane was flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), one of the two basic regulations governing civil aviation operations around the world.
Flights are conducted under VFR when visibility is over five kilometers, according to ATC manager Karna.
At the time of the crash, visibility around the airport was six kilometers, said Karna.
Under VFR, a pilot navigates an aircraft solely by reference to outside visual cues. But visual cue is difficult to get when a plane is enveloped by cloud and fog. There was plenty of fog around Kotdanda at the time of the crash, locals said.
The other flight regulation, called Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), is applicable when visibility is less than five kilometers. Under IFR, pilots operate flights solely based on data provided by flight instruments. An Agni Air turboprop that crashed in Makawanpur district in August 2010 killing 14 people was flying under IFR owing to poor visibility.
Last contact
There were absolutely no duress signals from the cockpit, according to ATCs.
The tower had two sightings of the plane after it entered Kathmandu Valley, said Purushottam Shakya, another ATC manager, who was marshalling the tower at the time of the crash.
The first sighting was after the plane had entered five miles inside Kathmandu Valley, Shakya said. This was minutes before the tower lost contact with the aircraft.
After seeing the aircraft, the tower instructed Captains J B Tamrakar and Padma Adhikari to fly the aircraft to a point four miles south of the airport from where all planes flying under VFR are aligned with the airport's runway for landing when the airport uses the 02 runway, or instructs planes to land from the south, like on Sunday. The alignment is different when planes are asked to land from the north, or use the 20 runway.
Thereafter the tower lost sight of the aircraft and also verbal and radar contact.
""But even after that, the aircraft briefly appeared from the clouds and again disappeared to never reappear,"" said Shakya.
Following loss of all contact with the aircraft, the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) at the airport was immediately brought into operation and all plane activity at the airport was halted for half-an-hour.
The Tara Air Pilatus aircraft that was tailing the Beechcraft was then asked to try to have a visual of the Beechcraft, according to Karna.
""This is common practice,"" said Karna. ""The Pilatus hovered over Kathmandu's sky for about 20 minutes and reported to the tower that the Beechcraft may "

In Uttar Pradesh, the worst-affected Indian state, five people froze to death overnight, said Surendra Srivastava, a police official in Lucknow, the state capital. Meteorology department officials forecast warmer weather in the area over the next few days.
City officials have distributed blankets and arranged for bonfires at street corners in and around Lucknow. Thousands of poor and homeless people huddled around small wood fires to keep warm.
Schools have been ordered closed across northern India until the cold wave lifts.
""With last night's deaths, the toll of people succumbing to the cold has gone up to 142 in Uttar Pradesh,"" Srivastava said. Another 12 people have died from the cold in other parts of northern India over the last three weeks.
Temperatures fell to nearly freezing in some parts of northern India overnight, but were a few degrees warmer in cities like New Delhi.
Though India is famous for its brutally hot summers, temperatures fall sharply for a few weeks in January and February. Poor people, particularly those living on the streets, are the worst hit by the drop in temperatures.
In neighboring Nepal, four people died Wednesday in the town of Gaur, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Katmandu, bringing the total to 14 deaths from the cold in the Himalayan kingdom this winter, said Umesh Pokhrel, a government official.
But the cold wave appeared to be easing in Bangladesh, where no deaths from the cold were reported on Thursday. At least 50 people have died because of frigid temperatures in the country since the cold spell began.
In neighboring Pakistan, at least 47 people have died of cold and pneumonia from a week of frigid weather in the country's remote northern Himalayan region.
The regional death toll does not include areas hit by a giant Oct. 8 earthquake that killed at least 87,000 people.
The World Health Organization last week reported 18 cold-related deaths in the quake zone over the previous six weeks.

""Over 4 million people are living with AIDS in the region. Of them, over 1 million are young people, who account for about half of all the new infections, including a growing number of young women,"" said Carol Bellamy, executive director of United Nations Children's Fund.
""Communication and peer education campaigns must be stepped up to ensure that young people are armed with the facts about HIV and its prevention,"" she said.
Delegates also said the disease is largely being spread by migration and the cross-border trafficking of women. About 5,000 Nepalese women work as prostitutes in neighboring India, and many come home with AIDS.

A Defense Ministry statement said this week that at least four Maoist guerrillas were killed when Royal Nepalese Army helicopters bombed the area near Thokarpa village, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of the capital, Katmandu.
Ian Martin of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal told The Associated Press a team would complete its investigation over the weekend to determine the circumstances of the bombing.
The U.N. agency has in the past expressed concern at the use of helicopters by the army for aerial bombing.
Martin said the agency has investigated past incidents and found ""in a number of cases ... that bombing has been indiscriminate or has been carried out in a way that puts civilians at risk and cause civilian casualties.""
Martin is expected to make a public statement on Monday based on the probe findings.
""We haven't had a chance to investigate it fully ... There are obvious concerns but we need to do our first-hand investigation before coming to a firm conclusion,"" Martin said.
Monday's Defense Ministry statement said the rebels fired first at the helicopters, which were on a routine patrol, and the forces on board were compelled to strike back.
The helicopters had pounded the area on Monday with bombs during the three-hour battle, according to a local government official who declined to be quoted for fear of reprisal by the Maoists.

The proposal calls for sending army troops, along with some 30 armored carriers, a mobile air force hospital unit and two helicopters with their crews, as well as a transport ship.
After an easy 40-19 Senate passage late Wednesday, the plan was headed to the lower House for debate early next week amid expectations of final approval by lawmakers from Kirchner's ruling Peronist party.
U.N. peacekeepers took command from an American-led multinational force on the troubled Caribbean island nation Tuesday. The mission is to provide security, which includes disarming rebels who helped oust Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Feb. 29, and pro-Aristide militants.
The U.N. handover comes as the country of 8 million copes with deadly floods that killed more than 1,700 in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
The United Nations says there will be 6,700 troops and 1,622 civilian police from more than two dozen countries led by 1,200 Brazilian troops. But it is awaiting commitments from Argentina and other nations that are expected to begin sending troops before the end of the month.
Critics of an Argentine commitment to the plan fretted that troops could be put in harms' way in a conflicted part of the world. But Kirchner's government said its contingent was designed to serve in a purely humanitarian role and not a military one.
Whether the overall U.N. force will reach full strength remains unclear. Brazil, Chile and Argentina have pledged a total of up to 2,500 troops. Other countries, including strife-torn nations such as Nepal and Rwanda, have promised 750 troops each.
In Argentina, lawmakers began meetings to schedule House debate on Haiti early next week with plans for a possible vote as early as next Wednesday or Thursday.

The protest in Kathmandu was part of a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations that have convulsed the capital for the past two weeks.
The journalists and 167 other people, many of them political activists, were arrested because they demonstrated in a central area of Kathmandu where protests have been banned since Gyanendra took power in February, police said.
Witnesses said police used batons and tear gas to break up the protest.
Although a number of journalists have been arrested in the wake of the king's takeover, this marked the largest single roundup.
The demonstrators were warned to disperse but when they refused ""we had to arrest them under the local administration act,"" a police statement issued late Friday said.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists said those arrested included the group's chairman, Buishnu Nishthuri, and Rishi Dhamala, president of the Reporters Club.
""Over a dozen journalists were injured in the police baton charge,"" federation general secretary Mahendra Bista told AFP.
During the demonstration, protesters hurled stones at police. An AFP photographer, Devendra Man Singh, was hurt by a rock and needed stitches.
Thousands of people have been turning out for daily protests organised by an alliance of seven political parties demanding a return to democracy in the impoverished Himalayan kingdom. 
The nation has been in turmoil since Gyanendra seized absolute power in February, a move he said was needed to end a deadly Maoist revolt aimed at overthrowing the monarchy that has claimed over 12,000 lives since 1996.
It was not clear when the protesters might be released although other demonstrators who have been arrested usually are freed the same night.

New legislation could be introduced to control the number of visitors, the reports said in the wake of long-standing concerns that climbers and other visitors pollute the mountain with hard-to-clear rubbish and waste.
""We need to limit the number of people who want to climb Mount Everest, who exert a negative impact on the environment,"" Zhang Yongze, the director of Tibet's Bureau of Environmental Protection, told the Xinhua news agency.
""We will also need to strengthen management of commercial activities involving (the mountain),"" he said in an interview. ""We don't want so many visitors to disturb the peak.""
AFP could not reach the bureau for comment Monday, but the China Daily said Zhang had suggested new laws could be introduced to restrict visitor numbers on the Chinese side of the mountain, which straddles the border with Nepal.
Authorities also intend to remove rubbish from Everest's slopes in the first half of next year, Zhang told Xinhua. Everest is vulnerable to littering as very little of what climbers leave behind decomposes in the cold environment.
""We have the responsibility to ensure that every drop of water flowing out of Mount Qomolangma into rivers and streams is clean,"" Zhang said, referring to Everest by its Tibetan name.
Scaling Everest has become big business and more than 2,000 people have so far succeeded in reaching the 8,848-metre (29,198-foot) peak. Many more visit the area around Everest without making it all the way to the summit.
More than 40,000 tourists visited last year on the Chinese side, leaving behind 120 tonnes of trash, the China Daily reported. But they were a fraction of the number visiting the Nepali side each year, according to the paper.
Campaigns to pick up the huge amounts of garbage left by visitors and climbers have been going on since 1992.
Last year, a team led by Japanese mountaineer Ken Noguchi collected about 500 kilograms (0.5 tonnes) of rubbish -- including tins, old tents, food and medicines -- during an annual clean-up at the world's highest peak.
China on Monday touted its own efforts to keep Mount Everest clean, citing last month's special Olympic torch relay to the peak as an example.
The 500 people involved in the torch relay were all instructed to bring their garbage down with them, the China Daily reported.
Expeditions from both Everest's Tibetan and Nepalese sides were banned during the relay to prevent any disruption of the special Olympic torch's journey to the summit.
There are believed to be at least 120 corpses on Everest too, which have been left there because of the difficulty of removing them, according to mnteverest.net.

 Kathmandu, 30 August: In the wake of Maoists' urban warfare targeting army officials and political figures, security has been tightened in the residences of high-ranking government officials, former officials, political figures, former politicians, diplomats, party offices of major political parties and vulnerable public areas. Security personnel have been heavily deployed in civil dresses as published throughout the valley.
 A reliable police source told The Kathmandu Post that the residences of 217 VIPs suspected of featuring in the Maoists' hit list have been tightly secured. A joint team of army and police comprising the valley security coordination committee has guarded residences of Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, former army chief Sachit SJB Rana, former minister Ramesh Nath Pandey and many others.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 31 Aug 03
Similarly, the Nepali Congress central office in Teku, Rastriya Prajatantra Party's office in Kamalpokhari, CPN-UML's Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) office in Balkhu and Nepal Sadbhavana Party's office in Naya Baneshwore have been encircled by a tightly knit group of security personnel.
 Security has been beefed in public places including important temples to prevent attacks like the bomb blast recently in Ram Janaki temple in Janakpur. Today, traffic was strictly restricted around the Pashupatinath temple area, fearing violence while thousands of women visited the temple to perform worship on the occasion of Teej, a Hindu festival when women fast for the welfare of their husbands.
 Meanwhile, valley Deputy Inspector-General DIG of Police Keshav Baral told The Kathmandu Post today that former state minister Devendra Raj Kandel, who was shot yesterday by the Maoists, had been warned by the police about the attack. Relying on information provided by police spies, Kandel had shifted from his house in Jawalakhel and rented a house in Kusunti where the shooting took place.
 Police have arrested 30 individuals from Lalitpur, suspecting them of involvement in the attempt on life of Kandel. According to Dr Manohar Lal Shrestha, director of Bir Hospital, Kandel had received five shots in yesterday's shoot-out. All the bullets have been successfully extracted from his body. Kandel's condition has improved considerably, according to Dr Shrestha.
 Army personnel have been strictly directed to keep from loitering in public places unless under security commands. Many high-ranking army officials have left behind their official vehicles in their offices and have taken to public transport in civil dresses, security sources said.
 DIG Baral claimed that many secretaries, joint secretaries and under-secretaries of various ministries featuring in the Maoists' hit list are being escorted to their respective ministries and back home by security personnel.

Protesters waved flags of the Tibetan government-in-exile and shouted ""Free Tibet,"" ""China liar, leave Tibet,"" and other slogans, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
""Some 300 Tibetan protesters have been held,"" police officer Bharat Lama told AFP, but added that -- as usual -- ""all of them will be freed later in the day.""
Riot police blocked the protesters as they tried to run towards the main gate of the embassy building and quickly bundled them into waiting vans and trucks after a brief tussle.
Kathmandu has seen almost daily protests since unrest erupted in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in March, prompting a crackdown by Chinese security forces.
Nepalese officials have repeatedly said no anti-China activity will be allowed as they seek to preserve friendly ties with their giant northern neighbour.

Four major political parties have announced they will begin Sunday an agitation campaign - including a mass rally in Katmandu - against the government led by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
Chand, a pro-monarchist, was appointed last year by King Gyanendra after firing an elected government.
The four parties have called the government unconstitutional and refused to support it despite repeated pleas by Chand. They have also refused to be part of the peace talks with the rebels which began last week.
""The government is committed to turning the cease-fire into permanent peace and bringing the rebels into mainstream politics,"" Chand said in an address to the nation over state-run Radio Nepal.
""I am doing everything I can to convince the major political parties to join in the peace process,"" Chand said. ""However, they seem to be busy looking for light with their eyes closed.""
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to abolish Nepal's constitutional monarchy and establish a socialist state. Over 7,000 people have been killed.
They declared a cease-fire in January and agreed to peace talks after the government agreed to stop calling them terrorists, rescinded a bounty on the heads of rebel leaders.
At the peace talks, the Maoists demanded that jailed rebel supporters be released and their cases dismissed. The rebels also want an interim government to be formed and a special assembly elected to draft a new constitution within the next six months.

"5082",2006727,"Title: Maoist killed as Nepal fears new wave of bloodshed.rtf; Date: January 6, 2006 Friday 1:52 PM GMT; Text: A Nepal Maoist rebel died in a battle with soldiers Friday, the army said, a day after three policemen were killed in the deadliest clash with the guerrillas since a ceasefire ended earlier this week.
The latest bloodshed came as human rights groups and analysts expressed fears about an upsurge in violence in the Himalayan kingdom and one leading Nepal human rights group called for a new ceasefire. 
Friday's clash took place in Rauthat district, 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of Kathmandu, an army official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""There were no army casualties,"" he added.
The rebel's death marked the fourth insurgency-related killing in 24 hours following the end Monday to the four-month ceasefire called by the rebels in the impoverished nation where King Gyanendra seized power last February.
On top of the policemen's killing in the clash in southwestern Nepal, at least eight explosions have shaken the nation since the end of the ceasefire.
""It seems the Maoists are trying to make their presence felt,"" said Royal Nepalese Army spokesman Brigadier General Nepal Bhusan Chand, adding that  ""security forces have been positioned on high alert nationwide.""
The Maoists rebels, battling for the past decade to overthrow the monarchy in a conflict that has claimed more than 12,000 lives, said it had decided to end the ceasefire because the royalist government refused to match it.
Maoist leader Prachanda said it would have been ""suicidal"" for the rebels to continue the truce. He said the rebels would resume hostilities against the forces of Gyanendra but not target civilians.
One of Nepal's main human rights groups, the Human Rights and Peace Society, called for a new truce.
""We're trying to request that both the state and the rebels announce a ceasefire immediately and hold peace talks,"" the group's general secretary, Homkant Chaulagain, said.
""The state seemed to instigate the rebels to break the ceasefire so it's responsible for the violence that will happen... which we deplore,"" he said.
""The situation is serious now and both the state and the opposition (rebels) seem to be bracing for big loss to life and property,"" he said.
Chaulagain's concern was echoed by others.
""The Maoists have chosen the same path of violence after the state did not give positive response to the ceasefire,"" said Lok Raj Baral, who teaches politics at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan University and is a former ambassador to India.
""Now the country is heading towards extreme polarization,"" he told AFP.
The end to the ceasefire comes ahead of municipal elections called by the king for February 8 as part of his ""roadmap to democracy.""
Gyanendra, who has said his takeover was necessary to end the insurgency, has said the municipal polls would be followed by national elections before April 2007.
Opposition politicians who formed a loose anti-royal alliance with the Maoists in October have vowed to boycott the municipal polls, branding them a whitewash aimed at placating international disapproval of the king's takeover.

"523",20033286,"Title: WTO ministers still search breakthrough at crunch talks.rtf; Date: September 12, 2003 Friday; Text: WTO ministers on Thursday got down to the nitty-gritty in a bid to break a deadlock blocking progress toward a new global trade pact amid few signs of headway.
The streets of downtown Cancun were relatively calm after violent anti-WTO protests and the suicide of a South Korean farmer marred the opening day of the talks on Wednesday.
Dozens of South Korean militants turned out to mourn the suicide and demand a halt to the five-day meeting, attended by about 4,600 delegates from the 146 WTO member states.
Ministers from members of the World Trade Organisation will be holed up in this Caribbean resort until Sunday, trying to salvage a multilateral deal to lower barriers to trade in farm products, industrial goods and services.
The broad outlines of the pact were worked out by WTO ministers in Doha, Qatar in 2001.
Agriculture is the key sticking point, with some countries still entrenched in years-old positions. In addition, fresh demands are emerging from newly-formed alliances that are growing on a daily basis.
Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry, George Yeo, who has been tasked with trying to close the gaps, reported earlier Thursday that divergences were still apparent after two days of meetings, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said.
Yeo told delegates he had started to see signs of flexibility, Rockwell said, adding: ""The flexibility that has been seen is not of a great substantive nature at the moment.""
Ministers endorsed the admission of Nepal and Cambodia into the fold on Thursday, making them the first of the so-called least-developed countries to complete negotiations to join the WTO.
They are expected to become full-fledged members in the coming months.
Countries also clashed over whether to launch talks on new WTO rules on cross-border investment and the three other so-called Singapore issues, revealing a stark division between developing countries on the one hand and the EU and Japan on the other.
Yoriko Kawaguchi, Japan's foreign minister, said of the issues, named after the venue where they were first taken up, that ""new rules would benefit us all, including developing members"".
Views are so divergent that a draft ministerial declaration currently offers two opposing options -- either to begin negotiations now or setttling for a statement that ""the situation does not provide a basis for the commencement of negotiations.""
The issue appears to be lining up behind agriculture as one of the hardest nuts to crack at the Cancun meeting.
But at a closed-door meeting, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick told his colleagues Thursday that unless the Cairns Group of major farm exporters and the Group of 21 developing countries made some concessions, the talks would collapse, one of the delegates said.
While the United States and the European Union have pledged to work for the reduction of farm subsidies, they are still far apart on how quickly such measures should be implemented.
Two other alliances, the 17-strong Cairns group led by Australia and the Group of 21 developing countries headed by Brazil, China and India, are pressing for deeper and faster cuts in subsidies.
The G-21 met the US and EU delegations for the first time in Cancun Thursday.
Brazilian Agriculture Minister Roberto Rodrigues said the meetings showed that the group of developing countries had become ""an important actor"" but added that the EU and US stance on export subsidies was not what they wanted to hear.
""But there is a dialogue going on. We are still hopeful that we can have some positive results,"" he told reporters.
But for its part, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler's spokesman said the G-21 had not shown any flexibility over its demands on farm subsidies, market acccess and export subsidies.
WTO Director General Supachai Panitchpakdi on Thursday took on the leading role in efforts to deal with a demand by West and Central African cotton producing countries for an end to subsidies paid by rich nations to their own cotton farmers.

There are a dead teenaged girl and a middle-aged man. And the investigators don't know who killed them. And these are the best in the country. Over four months since the murders, there is no murderer or murderers.
The Central Bureau of Investigation put up its hands on Tuesday saying they don't have enough to charge the three men in their custody accused of murdering Arushi Talwar and the family's domestic help Hemraj, a Nepalese citizen. They were killed on May 15/16.
Investigators believe they desperately need the weapon used in the murders and Aarushi's mobile phone, which apparently holds clinching clues to the killers. Without them, they are unable to connect the three accused in their custody to the murders.
A reward of Rs 1 lakh has been announced for anyone who can lead the investigators to the weapons and the phone. Sources said the phone has possibly reached Nepal and a written request for it has been sent to the Nepal government.
The agency was to file a chargesheet in the trial court on Tuesday against the accused - 90 days since their arrest according to trial rules. It couldn't file it. It said at a news conference it needed more time.
The agency's Deputy Director (Coordination) Neerja Gotru said, ""The investigation will continue. The CBI will file its report under section 173 Criminal Procedure Code only on conclusion of investigation. The full facts of the case will be presented before the court.""
The CBI took over the case after a series of serious lapses by the local Noida police. Its investigators went to arrest three persons - Krishna, the assistant of Aarushi's dentist father Rajesh Talwar, and domestic helps Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal.
Krishna and Kumar are believed to have sent Aarushi's mobile - a Nokia N-72 -to Nepal through an acquaintance. ""The mobile contains secrets that are directly linked to the murder case and that is why it was sent away by the accused,"" a source said.
Asked if the CBI will oppose the accused men's bail applications that might follow the failure to chargesheet them, Gotru said, ""If and when the bail applications come up, the full facts of the case will be presented before the court."" A source told HT, ""We know we have the right men in custody, on the basis of a range of scientific evidence. We just need material evidence.""

""The government released 17 pro-Maoist students and party leaders Friday,"" it said without naming those released.
The release of the detained rebels came after Maoist party politburo member and participant in their dialogue team, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, on Thursday expressed dissatisfaction that his colleges were still being detained by the army and police.
Mahara had demanded the withdrawal of a writ filed against top Maoist leaders and the release of his detained colleagues.
He warned that the proposed peace talks between the two sides could be hampered if his friends were not released.
The rebels claim that over 5,000 of their activists, students and supporters are still under army and police detention.
The government and the insurgents declared a truce in January to pave way for peace talks to end the ongoing bloody people's war, launched in 1996, for a communist republic.
The uprising has claimed over 7,800 lives while thousands have been displaced and injured.
The two sides also signed a 22-point Code of Conduct last week to hold the talks.
The government sources said the rebels would be released gradually after making necessary arrangements and checking their whereabouts.

 Kathmandu, Wednesday 24 March: The Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organization (GAESO) is preparing to file four cases against the British government at different courts in London and two other related cases at Nepal's Supreme Court soon, as the UK ""failed"" to resolve their problems through talks.
 ""We were waiting for the result of the 10 December meeting the British government was supposed to make public by the first week of March,"" said GAESO president Purna Bahadur Gurung.
 The UK's delay in publishing the result and its decision to increase ex-Gurkhas' pension has angered GAESO. The GAESO stated that pension hike has nothing to do with what they have been fighting for.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 25 Mar 04
However, Col Peter Sharland, defence attache at the British embassy, said the December dialogue was a ""private"" meeting between the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Public Interest Lawyers' P.  Phil Shiner. He said he was not aware of the agreement regarding the result that his government was supposed to make public.
 Stating that the UK always appreciated the Gurkhas' job, Sharland claimed ""GAESO does not represent the majority of the ex-Gurkha servicemen"". He admitted that the recent pension increment was a part of the annual pay review that depends upon the cost of living.
 ""The increment is 7 per cent higher than that of British soldiers,"" he said. But GAESO claimed ex-Gurkhas' pension is decreasing every year due to inflation.
 While GAESO is filing cases against British MoD's discrimination against Gurkhas during their service and thereafter, Col Sharland argued his government recruits Gurkhas as per 1947 tripartite agreement between Britain, Nepal and India . A case that GAESO plans to file at Nepal's Supreme Court (SC) is related to the agreement. ""The case that might lead to cancellation of the accord will be filed at the SC,"" said Gopal Siwakoti, legal adviser to GAESO.
 The next case GAESO is preparing to file at SC demands to know how the government dealing with UK government regarding their problems.
 The first case that GAESO has planned to file at UK courts is related to discrimination against British Gurkhas due to separate rulings by British courts. Second case is related to ex-Gurkhas' pension and the third case will be filed against the problems faced by ex-Gurkhas' widows and veteran of the World War II. Their fourth case is related to the whereabouts of Gurkhas who disappeared after different wars.

"489",20031908,"Title: Internet Cafe Opening on Mount Everest.rtf; Date: March 7, 2003 Friday; Text: It could be the most challenging Internet cafe project going.
Fifty years after two men conquered Mount Everest, a native Sherpa is determined to set up a cybercafe at the 17,400-foot-high base camp of the world's highest mountain.
Besides freezing temperatures and storms, there is no electricity or plumbing at the site. There aren't any permanent buildings, either.
""The Internet cafe I am planning will be in a temporary shed built with stone walls and covered with a tent,"" said entrepreneur Tsering Gyalzen, whose grandfather was one of more than 100 Sherpas who carried equipment and supplies in the 1953 expedition.
Gyalzen said he is forced to build a temporary structure because the base camp sits on a glacier that moves a few inches a day.
The cafe will open only during the spring and fall, when hundreds of mountaineers come to climb Everest and surrounding mountains in the Khumbu region.
""If we have Internet access on the base camp it would be easy to call for helicopters to airlift injured or sick mountaineers and also check on weather forecasts,"" said Ang Tshering, who operates a trekking business.
To relay the Internet data, Gyalzen is building a second hut in the Kalapathar area, about a two-hour trek below the base camp, for satellite equipment that will transmit signals through radio links to the Internet cafe.
""There are 19,000 to 50,000 trekkers that come to the Everest region every year. They would want to send a line of e-mail to their friends and family back home,"" Gyalzen said.
Since Everest was conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay on May 29, 1953, more than 1,200 people have climbed the mountain and nearly 200 died on its unpredictable slopes.
Gyalzen, like most Sherpas, lives in the Everest region. His family owns a hotel at Namche village.
Sherpas were mostly yak herders and traders living high in the Himalayas until Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for foreign mountaineers.
Gyalzen is an old hand at high-altitude Internet.
He already operates an Internet cafe at the 11,280-foot-high Namche village, also on the Everest trekking route. Using satellite links to the capital Katmandu, he provides access to foreign trekkers and local people.
A year after Namche's only telephone facility in the area was destroyed by Nepalese Maoist insurgents, Gyalzen set up a 48-line telephone exchange with lines enabling people in and around the village to communicate with each other.
However, the government has not allowed him to link his exchange to other parts of the country, so Gyalzen's Internet cafe is now the chief mode of communication between Namche and the rest of the world.
At his planned Everest base camp cafe, Gyalzen expects to install eight laptop computers, powered by generators and solar-charged batteries.
""It is a very a challenging project, both technically and when it is operational,"" he said.
First he must battle the Nepalese bureaucracy to get a license to import the satellite signal relay equipment from Israel. Then he has to airlift the equipment to an airstrip at Lukla and have it carried to the base camp on Yaks, which takes about a week. Gyalzen said he was still now sure about how many satellite dishes or what kind of transmitters and receivers he would be allowed to import.
He hopes the cafe will be ready by spring, when more than 100 mountaineers are expected to attempt scale the 29,035-foot Everest, celebrating the golden jubilee of the first conquest.
The proceeds, he said, will go to the Sagarmath Pollution Control Committee, which educates local Sherpas on the advantages of keeping the mountain clear of garbage and pollution. The committee also forces trekkers and mountaineers to take their trash away with them and has imposed a ban on glass bottles on Everest.
Though Gyalzen is doing the work, he's getting some funding.
New Jersey-based telecom analyst Gordon Cook and Dave Hughes, a 74-year-old Internet pioneer and retired Army colonel from Colorado Springs, Colo., helped him set up the project. Cisco Systems donated some radio equipment. The Square Network in Nepal is helping set up equipment at the base camp.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 29 May
Kathmandu, [Tuesday] 29 May: At least 16 people are reported killed and 100 others stranded during a snow storm in Dolpa while going to collect yarchagumba, a natural aphrodisiac, in Taitung Lake of Kaigaun VDC [village development committee area] in Dolpa District [western Nepal] on Tuesday.
According to Indra Chaudhari, assistant sub-inspector at Dunai police station, the team of yarchagumba gatherers had set up tents at Taitung Lake since the last few days when a blizzard buried them under a blanket of snow on Sunday evening and stranded them.
Home Ministry spokesperson Baman Prasad Neupane told eKantipur that rescue teams in helicopters had already been sent to the site of the mishap to rescue the survivors.
Local authorities said that many of the stranded have been severely injured. One Narayan Sahi of Rukum's Magma, who had gone to collect yarchagumba, was reported to have died of hypothermia on Sunday itself.
According to our Nepalgunj correspondent, a ground team including personnel from the Nepal Police has been dispatched for the site of the blizzard, which lies four days' walk form district headquarters Dunai.
Though the trade of yarchagumba (cordyceps sinensis), that grows in the high meadows in the western Himalayan region of Nepal, is banned, it has an international market price of 250,000 rupees [approx 4,000 US dollars] per kg.
A majority of the rural poor and marginalized people from the high mountain areas of the mid and far western development regions depend on these herbs for a partial income and health care, with large gathering parties scouring the mountainside around this time every year.

G.P. Koirala, 84, had an hour-long audience with King Gyanendra just three days after the nation's parliament agreed to turn the world's only Hindu monarchy into a secular state and stripped the monarch of many of his powers.
""The prime minister today discussed the current political scenario,"" said Basanta Kumar Gautam, a member of the premier's staff.
The two men met at the king's palace in the capital Kathmandu where Koirala was sworn in last month as head of an interim government after weeks of protests against the king's outright rule.
Gyanendra seized control of the country in February last year, accusing the then government of corruption and failure to stem a Maoist insurgency but popular protests forced him to step aside and recall parliament.
On Thursday, in an unanimously passed proclamation, the government stripped King Gyanendra of political power and removed his control of the army.
Under other provisions, the government will choose the successor to the throne and the royal family will also have to pay tax on properties and income.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 17 April
Kathmandu, 16 April: In a major turn of events, private and joint venture banks Sunday [16 April] closed down regular services from the afternoon, bringing the entire banking system to a standstill on the 11th day of the general strike. ""We have closed down banking services due to ongoing situation. We regret the inconvenience,"" read a notice of Nepal Investment Bank glued to its closed shutters at its Putalisadak branch. The bank suddenly pulled down shutters at 1 p.m. [local time].
Other banks too closed down services after a delegation of four large trade unions met the top brass of private and JV banks and requested them to support the ongoing people's movement. Nepal Trade Union Congress, General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions, Democratic Confederation of Nepalese Trade Unions and Confederation of Professio-nals Nepal (COPN), issuing statements, have been urging private banks to join hands with the agitating public sector institutions.
""Today we met the bankers and staff of all private and JV banks personally and convinced them to join the protests,"" said Premal Khanal, general secretary of the COPN. Talking to the Post he said all the banks responded positively to closure calls. Nepal Bankers Association (NBA) President Radhesh Pant, meanwhile, said a formal decision to the trade unions' request would come only Monday when NBA executive committee meets. He also said the rate of withdrawal had increased by around 25 per cent.
Meanwhile, staff at public sector financial institutions including Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), Nepal Bank Ltd, Agricultural Development Bank and Employees Provident Fund who are on strike since the last 10 days continued their protests on Sunday. They briefly opened withdrawal services, but refused revenue deposits, cash deposits and other transactions. ""From Tuesday we will stop that as well and go on to full closure,"" said Narayan Subedi of RBB Employees Association. Meanwhile, protesters also vandalized the Pulchowk branch of Himalayan Bank Ltd and broke most of the window panes on the first floor of the bank.

The bomb was minor one and the Vice-President was not at the residence when the bomb exploded, SP Sarbendra Khanal said. The injured person was rushed to hospital for treatment and the police have launched the investigation. It is not clear who was behind the explosion. Recently, Mr Jha was in controversy after he took oath in Hindi, leading to protest across the country. Mr Jha was elected as Nepal's first Vice-President last month after the Himalayan nation abolished the 239-year-old monarchy and turned it into a republic. ''Somebody threw a bomb at the window of my home under the cover of darkness when there was no electricity in the area,'' Reuters quoted Mr Jha as saying, adding, ''I am safe but the blast destroyed the window panes of the building.'' He said two of his security guards were hurt but according to police official only one guard was wounded. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast which is being investigated, he told Reuters.

The Dera reportedly broke off communication with the peace mediating multi-religious group headed by Swami Agnivesh. It also filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court for protection against the Akal Takht diktat asking the Deras shut down by May 27.
  Some mediation had helped a draft of the Dera Chief Baba Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh's apology be framed on Thursday. But seeing the way things are developing, the Punjab police is preparing for trouble on May 27. Adding to their apprehension on the day is the 'Bhog' ceremony of 29-year-old Kamaljit Singh. Singh was killed in the incidents after the confrontation at Sunam on May 17. Sikh hardliners are calling for a large community presence at Bhog at Gurdwara Nanaksar in Sangrur.
  Sensing the surcharged atmosphere, force has been deployed in strength in the sensitive areas. And while the administration hoped the hardliners did not hijack the ceremony, the Damdami Taksal leader Harnam Singh Dhuma and Dal Khalsa activists have already called any apology by the Dera Chief unacceptable. Dal Khalsa sources said, ""in Sikhism, an apology which is extracted is not an apology and the Deras must shut down at any cost"".
  Dera followers said while they wanted a peaceful settlement they could not allow the closure of the Deras. They added that it was the constitutional duty of the Punjab government to protect provide the ""over 1.5 crore followers of the Baba"". Sources said the Dera did not entirely trust the state government or the Akalis but was willing to give a peace initiative a chance.
  The Dera Chief's letter of regret released some days ago was drafted in consultation with the Punjab government. But the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee took a strident stand the very next day. Its chief not only declared that the Akal Takht edict was the final word for Sikhs but also blamed the Congress for causing the tension.
  Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal who returned to Chandigarh from his foreign visit on Friday also referred to the complicity of the Congress in instigating riots all over the country in the past. Punjab watchers interpret the observations as a continuation of the Akalis' stand in the past few days.
  Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who is in Nepal is expected to reach Patiala on Saturday.

 Lhasa, 12 July: No immediate report of death or injury from the severe earthquake that jolted southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region Monday 12 July morning was available, local officials said.
 A quake measuring 6.7 on the Richter Scale struck the autonomous region's Zhongba County of Xigaze Prefecture and Coqen County of Ngari Prefecture at 7.08 a.m. local time , Monday.
 Officials of the two counties searched areas near town and county seats and so far found no one killed or injured.
Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 0837 gmt 12 Jul 04
The final report on any death toll or damage will not be available for at least about 15 days, said Toinzhub, county head of Zhongba.
 He said the inconvenient local traffic conditions was to blame for the delay.
 The jolt, which lasted about two minutes, could be felt in some townships of the two counties, according to county officials.
 The epicentre was located in Longger Township of Zhongba County, at 30.5 degrees north latitude and 83.4 degrees east longitude.
 People of the township situated at an altitude above 5,000 m on the Gangdise Range live on herding. Zhongba County has a population of approximately 20,000.
 Township head Lobsang Lhunzhub said cracks were spotted in two houses near the township government and officials had been sent to villages to look for possible damages and death tolls door to door.
 The fact that herders live scattered around the vast area, the township head said, added to the difficulty of gathering information.
 The epicentre is about 100 km north of the border of China and Nepal, 120 km from Zhongba County, 560 km from Xigaze City and 680 km from the regional capital of Lhasa.
 It takes a day's drive from the county seat of Zhongba to the epicentre.
 An emergency rescue team sent by the State Seismological Bureau is now ready to leave for the quake-jolted area.

A joint team of Nepal and India is trying to control the wearing away of the Koshi embankments using wire nets, stones, aggregates, sand and soil.

The team is still trying to control the river course that is heading towards the eastern villages using wire nets since the flood has already eroded all the nose of the Spur.
Chairman of Koshi Victims' Group (KVG) Amar Karki said that there is still risk even if the depth of the water has decreased.
Chief engineer of Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP) Mohan Bhattarai said that if the construction material is provided sufficiently there will be no problem to control the wearing away. Bhattarai also informed that due to the lack of material, the task has been slowed down.
More than 500 labourers have been mobilized to control the wearing away of the spur.

"6924",20081503,"Title: Former rebels win 3 seats in early results, Nepal 's Election Commission says.rtf; Date: April 12, 2008 Saturday 5:31 AM GMT; Text: Former rebels have won control in three out of five constituencies where vote-counting has been completed in an election for Nepal's Constituent Assembly, the Election Commission said Saturday.
Early results from Thursday's vote indicated the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) who ended their 10-year insurgency in 2006 could also be set to win control in 55 other constituencies where counting was still going on, the commission said.
Of the five constituencies counted by early Saturday, the Maoists had three seats, while the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) each secured one, it said.
A complete count of votes in all 240 constituencies was expected to take several weeks.
The Maoists who are still considered a terrorist group by the United States were already predicting victory in the election for the 601-seat assembly that will be responsible for writing Nepal's new constitution.
""We will get a clear majority in the final results,"" said Hisila Yami, a senior member of the Maoist party and a minister in the coalition government.
""People have chosen us to lead the country,"" she said. ""This is a reflection of the people's desire for a republic that our party has always stood for.""
The election has been touted as the cornerstone of the 2006 peace deal struck between the government and the former rebels. The agreement followed months of unrest that forced Nepal's king to cede absolute power.
Scattered shootings and clashes that killed two people on election day and eight others in the days leading up to the poll did not deter millions of Nepalis from casting ballots in Thursday's vote in the Himalayan country's first election in nine years.
None of the 54 parties vying for seats in the assembly is expected to win a landslide, and with 20,000 voting stations spread across the country some a seven-day walk from the nearest paved road officials say it could be several weeks before a complete tally is ready.
The distribution of seats in the new assembly also adds to the complexity of counting the results. There were direct elections for 240 of the assembly's seats, and a nationwide proportional representation system with quotas for women and myriad ethnic and caste groups is being used to pick 335 of the seats. The remaining 26 seats are reserved for major politicians who don't win seats and other notables.
The Election Commission said there would be re-polling in at least 60 locations because of voting irregularities, and that number could rise as election complaints are investigated. Several candidates have claimed their supporters were barred from voting by rival groups and have complained of election fraud.

Speaking at an interaction organized by Reporters' Club Nepal, Sadbhawana Party Chairman Rajendra Mahato the Maoists must accept fundamental elements of a democratic constitution and form a new national consensus government before the CA term is extended.
""The Maoists must take the peace process towards its conclusion before May 28. Only then can we can think of extending the CA term,"" he said.
Sadbhawana Party is one of the constituent of UDMF, a loose alliance of various Madhes-based parties.
Mahato said there is no point in extending the CA term without forging national consensus. Stating that the extended one year term of the CA passed without any significant progress in the peace process, Mahato said, ""The same thing is likely to repeat if CA term is extended without forging a national consensus. This is the common position of Sadbhawana party and United Democratic Madhes Front.""
He also warned that his party would resort to stringent protests if the CA term is extended for vested interests if the ruling parties.
Mahato said lawmakers from his party could tender mass resignation in protest if the ruling parties turn a deaf ear to their concerns.
""The need of the hour is not just the resignation of the prime minister but the formation of national consensus government. Only the formation of national consensus government can deliver peace and new statute,"" he said. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

"7479",20117571,"Title: PM backtracks on peace process.rtf; Date: September 28, 2011 Wednesday; Text: Nepal, Sept. 28 -- When Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai retuned from New York after attending the UN General Assembly meeting, which he should not have gone in the first place given the urgency of the business at home, the common expectation was that he would immediately expedite the peace process to complete it within 45 days from the formation of his government. He didn't just dash that expectation but backtracked on his earlier commitment and disappointed Nepalis, including many of his supporters and those who had pinned hope on this prime minister. Talking to media persons at the airport, Prime Minister Bhattarai said he had committed himself to conclude the major tasks of peace process within 45 days after there was a broader political consensus with the political parties. Prime Minister Bhattarai is clearly backtracking on his promise.
On August 25, the deadline given by President Ram Baran Yadav for formation of the consensus government expired, the Maoist party organized a press conference, attended by its top leaders, including Prime Minister Bhattarai, and made public its 5-point proposal to complete the peace process and constitution writing. Point 1 (chha) of the proposal says following an agreement on issues related to peace process, categorization of the combatants will begin on August 31 and complete within a month. Point 1 (jha) even says that a formal program will be held within one-and-half month to bid farewell to all the combatants from the cantonments. It's important to understand the context of this proposal-it was floated seeking support of the parties to form a government led by Baburam Bhattarai. Maoists and Nepali Congress were too busy soliciting support from other parties to lead the government and there was no negotiation on peace process at all till August 29 when Bhattarai was elected as the prime minister.
It was on August 31, chairing the first meeting of the Special Committee, Prime Minister Bhattarai reiterated his pledge to complete the peace process in 45 days and even said that his government would be the shortest if there was no progress on peace and constitution. The insincerity with which prime minister has disowned his ""45 days"" pledge made before the nation is unfortunate to say the least. We urge the prime minister and his party to come up with a sincere proposal on all contentious issues of the peace process. We don't have the luxury of time to move forward on a piecemeal basis on peace process as he and his party has been urging nor is that an effective approach. It's only if the NC and CPN-UML reject a reasonable proposal by the prime minister that he can blame them for dragging their feet on the peace process; otherwise, people will hold Maoists-who lead the government and control the combatants-responsible for the lack of progress Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

"3379",20043223,"Title: Nepalese capital under curfew for third day as officials try to recover bodies of slain hostages.rtf; Date: September 3, 2004 Friday; Text: A shoot-on-sight curfew imposed in Katmandu to prevent riots and violent protests over the killing of 12 Nepalese workers in Iraq entered its third day Friday, as officials said they were trying to recover the hostages' bodies.
The prime minister, meanwhile, ordered a probe into earlier mob attacks on a mosque, media offices and Middle Eastern and Pakistani airline offices in Nepal's capital.
Tourists trickling into Katmandu were driven to their hotels in buses with armed escorts, and soldiers kept watch as city workers swept broken glass, burnt tires and pieces of broken furniture from the debris-littered streets.
The lockdown on Katmandu also forced the cancellation of Friday prayers at the Jame mosque, which was ransacked on Wednesday after an angry mob received word that the Nepalese hostages had been killed. Troops guarded the mosque, the capital's only Muslim house of worship.
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba visited the mosque Friday and ordered an investigation into the attack.
""Those found guilty will be punished,"" Deuba said.
A video posted on a Web site Tuesday showed militants killing the 12 Nepalese workers in Iraq, sparking riots in major cities across Nepal that left two dead.
Information Minister Mohammed Mohsin said the government was using ""appropriate channels to bring back the bodies"" of the Nepalese workers, who disappeared soon after entering Iraq from Jordan on Aug. 19.
Officials have received information that the body of one of the slain hostages was found in Iraq, Foreign Minster Prakash Sharan Mahat later told reporters. He didn't elaborate.
He also said the government has asked the International Red Cross for help in recovering the bodies.
Officials have admitted that they have not been able to establish direct contact with the hostage-takers. Nepal's ambassador to Iraq, Puskar Rajbhandari, said he had appealed to the insurgents through various Arabic television stations to hand over the bodies.
Mahat also urged all Nepalese in Iraq to leave. ""We will do whatever we can do to bring them back,"" he said.
Hundred of Nepalese workers who had been headed for Iraq were stranded in Kuwait after being turned back at the border, Mahat added.
The curfew in Katmandu - accompanied by a warning that violators would be shot on sight - was lifted for 3 1/2 hours Friday morning so people could stock up on food and other supplies. It was also briefly lifted Thursday.
Large crowds gathered on street corners to buy newspapers and meet friends and relatives before they were sent back home 3 1/2 hours later.
Most outgoing domestic flights were canceled, said airport official Keshav Khanal. Pakistan International Airlines, Qatar Airways, India's Jet Airlines, Gulf Airways and Bangladesh's Biman Airlines canceled internationals flights, he said.
Iraqi militants have taken more than 100 foreigners hostage in recent months.
Nepal, which has no troops in Iraq, has long banned its citizens from working there because of security concerns. However, many people from the poor Himalayan nation take jobs abroad and 17,000 Nepalese are believed to have slipped into Iraq - many working as armed security guards for foreign contractors.

"7577",20116058,"Title: Pakistan _ Biggest quake in 80 years kills nine in Nepal.rtf; Date: September 21, 2011 Wednesday; Text: Kathmandu, Sept. 21 -- After initial panic and chaos, prayers began to be offered in Nepal with the realisation that the earthquake that hit its eastern region and capital city Kathmandu along with India Sunday could have wreaked far greater devastation, being the biggest in almost eight decades. Nine people were killed.
As the resilient Himalayan state began to limp back to normal Monday following a trembler measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale, the toll had risen to at least nine with the news of another unconfirmed casualty, while over 100 people had received injuries with hundreds of houses and buildings collapsing.
The cramped capital, full of decrepit houses and little adherence to building regulations, suffered with three people dying in a wall collapse while over 50 were injured trying to jump down from windows and balconies in the panic.
Police said Monday the nine ft wall fencing the compound of the British Embassy in the Lainchaur area of the capital, close to the Indian Embassy, collapsed Sunday evening, soon after the jolt, smashing down on a two-wheeler, a car and a pedestrian.
Sajan Shrestha, a 38-year-old security guard employed by the Danish government's aid agency Danida was riding past the embassy on his two-wheeler with his teenaged daughter Anisha when the concrete wall fell on them, injuring both severely.
A passerby, Bir Bahadur Majhi, in his late teens, was also fatally injured.
Army and armed police personnel assisted by locals dug out the three from under the debris and rushed them to the Manmohan Memorial Hospital where all three succumbed to their injuries.
Four more people in a passing car were also injured and were receiving medical treatment, police said.
In Dharan town in eastern Sunsari district, a popular recruitment centre for the Indian and British Armies, Santosh Pariyar, in his 30s, a tailor associated with the Nepal Army, and his nephew Bimal Pariyar, 7, died when the roof of their room collapsed.
On Monday morning, more casualties were reported.
A sixth man, Ishwor Gyawali, was killed in Bhaktapur district in Kathmandu valley.
In the east, a 40-year-old woman, Madhu Karki, had been killed in Dhankuta district, and an eighth, a young girl identified as Ayesha Ghimire, had succumbed to injuries in Mechi town close to the Indian border.
The ninth death was reported from Sankhuwasabha district with the victim identified as Pradeep Rai.
The National Seismological Centre said it was the biggest tremor to hit Nepal since 1934 when a quake measuring 8.4 had killed over 8,500 people in the Himalayan state alone besides causing damage in India's Bihar state.
Officials said Nepal was spared greater havoc this time since the epicentre of the quake was farther away in Sikkim in northeastern India and not in Bihar, the Indian state adjoining Nepal's boundary.
The probability of yet another immediate jolt was also lessened by nearly three dozen smaller tremors appearing in quick succession after the biggest one.
""I thought I had a bout of dizziness,"" said Pramila Majhi, a construction worker who had taken her son to the doctor's when the quake struck. ""The room spun around, the walls tilted. I knew I could not run down to the streets with my sick son. So I simply prayed.""
Hundreds of people rushed out on the streets in the capital with little open space, crying and taking the names of gods as the tremors started. There were scenes of people jumping down from upper stories and sustaining injuries.
In two prisons in the capital - the Central Jail and Dillibazar Jail - some prisoners received broken arms and legs in the ensuing stampede as they tried to run out.
In Thamel, Kathmandu's tourist area, and the nearby five-star hotels, foreign guests rushed out on the streets and could be persuaded to go back to their rooms only after the alarm subsided.
The chaos was compounded by heavy rains and a temporary power blackout. Telephone lines were hit and the dark roads were filled with the blare of ambulances.
Nepal's parliament was in session when the quake struck, causing alarmed lawmakers to scream and run out for safety. Chairman Subash Nembang said he was adjourning the house for some time.
Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, poised to depart for New York Sunday night to attend the 66th UN General Assembly, called an emergency meeting of the cabinet to discuss rescue and relief measures.
Panic also spread among mountaineers on different expeditions in the Himalayan region and many houses in northern Lukla district, considered the gateway to Mt Everest, had developed crack Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

"1672",20044090,"Title: Maoist rebels warn of major attack after bus bombing in Nepal capital.rtf; Date: May 30, 2004 Sunday; Text: Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow Nepal's monarchy warned Sunday of a major attack after a rare bombing on a passenger bus in the capital Kathmandu left one dead and 25 injured.
A rebel leader defended the abduction of an estimated 1,400 students and teachers over the past week from four war-torn districts, saying the hostages were being readied for battle.
""The Maoists have been giving armed combat training and revolutionary education to the abductees to absorb them in the (rebel) army before the Maoists launch a nationwide attack,"" Bam Dev Kshetri, a Maoist central committee member, told AFP.
Kshetri declined to give details of the attack. The Maoists are known for massive nighttime raids on isolated police posts in their bid to wrest the Himalayan kingdom's countryside from government control.
Attacks have been relatively infrequent in Kathmandu, where the rebels have focused on planting small bombs in government buildings and assassinating officials.
But on Sunday, a bomb tore through a bus in the capital outside the head office of state-run Royal Nepal Airlines, scattering shattered glass and metal across a busy street.
A police official said one civilian was killed and 25 other passengers injured, including a policeman and a soldier. A doctor treating the wounded said four were in serious condition.
The police official, who did not want to be named, said three suspected Maoists ran out onto the street shouting to passengers that a bomb had been planted on the blue Indian-built bus.
""The driver helped everyone come out quickly. But nothing went off and people thought it was all a hoax and started boarding again. Then the bomb exploded,"" the official said.
The bus, whose front half was gutted by the blast, had been headed to western Nepal, which has seen most of the bloodshed during the eight-year Maoist rebellion.
Police said the largest-scale kidnappings in the past week were in the western Jajarkot district, where the rebels snatched at least 500 students and 300 teachers from 270 schools.
Suomi Sakai, the resident representative in Nepal of the UN children's agency UNICEF, appealed to the Maoists to release the hostages.
""To ensure schools as zones of peace, disruptive activities should not take place within 500 metres from its area,"" he said in a statement.
Leading Nepalese human rights activist Subodh Pyakurel estimated that more than 12,000 students and teachers have been abducted and released since the rebels ended a ceasefire in August.
""The Maoists provide them with revolutionary education for periods of 10 days to two weeks,"" said Pyakurel, president of the independent rights group Informal Sector Service Centre.
The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.
Observers say the Maoists seem intent on exploiting a power vacuum since the resignation on May 7 of prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a royalist handpicked by King Gyanendra, who faced weeks of angry demonstrations by opposition parties.
The king, who sacked the elected government in 2002, has opened a dialogue with the opposition on picking a new prime minister. But no breakthrough has been reached and dozens of slogan-chanting opposition activists rallied again Sunday outside the royal palace.
Amid the chaos, the Maoists have called an increasing number of strikes, including a three-day nationwide shutdown set to begin June 10.

"1710",20043942,"Title: Nepal king gives police sweeping powers as protests thwarted near palace.rtf; Date: April 10, 2004 Saturday; Text: King Gyanendra of Nepal on Saturday gave security forces sweeping powers of arrest, as riot police rounded up hundreds more pro-democracy protesters outside his palace, officials said.
State radio said the king renewed an ordinance that gives police and troops the right to detain people and search homes on suspicion of ""terrorist"" activities.
The ordinance had just expired after being imposed by parliament for two years in April 2002. King Gyanendra, who dismissed the elected government six months later, extended it in the absence of a parliament.
The measure was designed to help troops battle Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy.
But its renewal comes after a week of massive demonstrations in Kathmandu demanding the restoration of democracy. The protests are sponsored by the main parties in the dissolved parliament, which are not linked to the Maoists.
At least 1,500 protesters gathered Saturday in a park outside the palace but were promptly rounded up by police enforcing a two-day-old ban on public gatherings in the capital, witnesses said.
On a nearby street, police baton-charged demonstrators who lobbed stones. A police officer was seen with blood on his head after he was hit by a stone.
Tens of thousands had rallied Friday outside the palace but their threats to cross the barbed-wire barricades and storm the sprawling palace compound were thwarted when police detained them en masse.
""Most of the protesters have been released soon after Friday's events but nearly 1,600 of them remain in custody,"" a police officer said on condition of anonymity before the latest detentions.
Opposition parties charged that the government did not supply food, water or beds for the detained protesters who spent the night crammed in three public buildings.
Some of the protesters were being kept at the national food warehouse, which is used each autumn to store Tibetan goats awaiting slaughter for the Hindu kingdom's Durga Puja festival.
""This is the height of cruelty. They're being housed on the city's outskirts and those who are elderly or sick have had to walk back to their homes after being released,"" said Arjun Narsingh K.C., spokesman for the opposition Nepali Congress party.
Opposition leaders played down their failure to make good on threats to storm the palace, saying they already defied the ban on public assembly.
The government indefinitely banned demonstrations Thursday saying the rallies would be infiltrated by the Maoists, who have offered moral support to the protests in Kathmandu.
But the Maoists also have a tense relationship with the parties dating from the crackdowns launched on them by democratically elected governments.
The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the opposition's consensus prime ministerial candidate, said one of its activists, Tara Chandra Regmi, was killed by Maoists Friday in the northwestern Bajura district.
Madhav Kumar Nepal, meeting a delegation of rights activists from Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India and Thailand, said: ""Our fight is directly with the king.""
""We are fighting to restore sovereignty to the people and we will fight for this until we succeed,"" Nepal said.
Elsewhere, police clashed with opposition supporters who torched a statue of King Mahendra, the current king's late father, in the southwestern town of Butwal, a police officer said. He did not know if there were injuries.

Kathmandu, 24 April: Chairman of the former rebels Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Prachanda Thursday claimed that it has been confirmed that he will be leading the next government.

Prime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai said he would bring a time-bound work plan soon to accomplish the major tasks of the peace process within 45 days.
The PM said so at a meeting of five-point Agreement Implementation Monitoring Special Committee of the Parliament headed by Constituent Assembly Chairman Subas Nembang held at Singha Durbar.
He said the Special Committee (on supervision, integration and rehabilitation of Maoist combatants) will send the survey teams to the field for the task of categorisation of the combatants into three groups - those wishing for voluntary retirement, those ready for integration and those seeking rehabilitation.
Although, the SC has selected 120 staffers for the survey teams, it is yet to appoint them due to political parties' failure to agree upon theoretical issues - integration number, norms, modality, rank determination and rehabilitation package. The UCPN-M and other parties, mainly the NC and CPN-UML, are divided on whether to send the survey teams before agreeing upon the theoretical issues.
Maoist leader Dev Gurung said the survey teams could be deployed to the cantonments to begin the task of categorising the combatants and the decision on the theoretical issues could be settled gradually.
However, Dr Minendra Rijal, NC member in the SC, wondered, ""How can the survey teams be deployed without settling the theoretical issues?"" The survey teams will be unable to give options to the combatants for categorisation until the norms, modality, rank and rehabilitation packages are agreed upon, he reasoned.
Maoist SC member Barshaman Pun said thorough discussions would begin tomorrow on his party's proposal on army integration.
The PM informed the monitoring committee that he would replace Janardan Sharma at the SC from Unified CPN-Maoist as per the party's Standing Committee meeting and he requested UML leadership to send a name from the party to replace former PM Jhalanath Khanal at the SC. Two members each from the three major parties represent the SC.
According to a member of the committee, PM said, ""I will move the task ahead with maximum flexibility. But I need the help of other parties.""
He said although the parties were close to an agreement on the peace process issues he refused to disclose the level of closeness.
NC leader Nidhi and Chief Whip Laxman Ghimire and UML Chief Whip Bhim Acharya told the meeting that NC and UML would not act as opposition parties on the issues pertaining to peace and constitution writing processes.
As the monitoring panel's term expires tomorrow, the members demanded formation of a panel to oversee the peace process issues. CA Chairman Nembang assured them to take initiative in this regard.

Air force commanders in eastern India are wary, but then, that's their job. They told The Associated Press this week about a sequenced plan to deactivate and refurbish the Kalaikunda and Hasimara air bases in West Bengal state and Tezpur in Assam over the next few months.
Squadrons from each base will move to another during the upgrading of runways, installing of precision approach radars and improving of air traffic control equipment. The airmen have already been moved out of Kalaikunda.
The improvements include the induction of surface-to-air missiles at the eastern bases, a top Indian air force officer told the AP on condition of anonymity.
India shares its eastern borders with China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, but it has fought a war with only one of those countries, China, in 1962. There was also a limited frontier clash in 1986.
""We are concerned about the strategical encircling of India by China, which wants to have an influence over the Indian Ocean,"" said Air Commodore K.K. Nowhar, commander of India's Hasimara air base, 700 kilometers (435 miles) north of Calcutta.
""It's important to remember China says often the Indian Ocean is not India's ocean,"" Nowhar said in an interview Monday.
""The Hasimara air base is strategically important as it is the nearest to the Chinese border and can take out the Chinese airfields in and around Tibet the first thing,"" in case of war, Nowhar said.
The improvements of the air bases will ensure that all of India's top-line fighter aircraft can operate from them, he said.
Following their 1962 border clash, India and China remained wary for decades. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said at the time the nation tested nuclear weapons in 1998, that ""China is enemy No. 1.""
Only this year have they have taken important steps in settling one part of their long, disputed border. They agreed to open a highway across the frontier in the Buddhist majority region of Sikkim after a visit by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Beijing in June. China recently dropped from a government Web site a reference to the Indian state of Sikkim as a separate country.
Yet, during Vajpayee's visit to Beijing, the Indian foreign ministry said, a Chinese army patrol had entered Indian territory in the state of Arunachal Pradesh and briefly taken Indian soldiers prisoner.
China claims 90,000 square kilometers (34,750 square miles) of land in Arunachal Pradesh. India says China still holds 38,000 square kilometers (14,670 square miles) of its territory at Aksai Chin in Kashmir.
India and China are among the world's fastest growing economies and both countries aim to double their bilateral trade to US$10 billion by 2004.
India's exports to China are increasing at about 100 percent annually. The two countries are also increasingly co-operating on international issues such as the situation in Iraq and negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
Encouraged by their improving relations, India and China want to start negotiations on a possible free trade area, The Times of India reported this week.

An embassy notice issued Saturday warned of possible attacks, despite assurances from the top rebel leader that his forces would not attack any Americans, unless they were connected to Nepal's military.
The rebels have criticized Washington for giving the Nepalese government millions of dollars in military and development aid, and training Nepalese soldiers. Last month, the rebels threatened to target U.S.-backed organizations in Nepal.
Washington responded by advising its citizens not to visit the Himalayan kingdom.
""Americans in Nepal are urged to maintain a low profile, and to exercise special caution during the upcoming time period,"" the embassy notice said.
There have been no reports of attacks against Americans by the leftist guerrillas, but some Western trekkers have been stopped and asked for money.
Rebel leader Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, said last week Americans are safe in Nepal, as long as they are not part of any military operation.
Prachanda said it has never been rebel policy to harm foreign citizens.
The Maoists, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, want to topple the country's constitutional monarchy and establish a communist state.
Fighting has escalated since the rebels pulled out of a cease-fire in August. Nearly 500 people have died since fighting resumed.
More than 7,500 people have been killed since the insurgency began in 1996.

MOHALI, India, March 30: Disciplined bowling by India saw them beat Pakistan by 29 runs on Wednesday to set-up a World Cup final against Sri Lanka in Mumbai on Saturday.
Pakistan, chasing 261 for victory, were dismissed for 231 with a ball to spare after all of India's five bowlers took two wickets apiece.
Misbah-ul-Haq, who top-scored for Pakistan with 56, helped take them from 208 for nine to a situation where an unlikely 30 was needed off the last over.
But Zaheer Khan held his nerve, bowling four dot balls before Misbah holed out to Virat Kohli to the delight of a capacity crowd.
India's 260 for nine after winning the toss against their arch-rivals was built around man-of-the-match Sachin Tendulkar's 85.
But they might have made considerably less had not the star batsman been dropped four times in an innings that still left him one short of a hundred international hundreds.
Left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz led Pakistan's attack with career-best figures of five for 46.
Pakistan saw Kamran Akmal start their pursuit with a first ball four off Zaheer.
But the left-arm quick had his revenge with a slower ball the opener sliced to Yuvraj Singh at point to leave Pakistan 44 for one.
Mohammad Hafeez made 43 before he was caught behind after trying to sweep seamer Munaf Patel.
Yuvraj, out for a golden duck, atoned in front of his home crowd with two wickets for no runs in five balls as Pakistan slumped to 106 for four.
The left-arm spinner bowled Asad Shafiq (30) as the batsman made room to cut and then had the experienced Younus Khan (13) caught at cover by Suresh Raina.
Umar Akmal, however, counter-attacked in trademark style, pulling and driving Yuvraj for the first two sixes of the match.
But on 29 he was bowled by an arm ball from local hero Harbhajan Singh to leave Pakistan 142 for five.
Pakistan required 84 off the last 10 overs and needed a big innings from big-hitting but out of form skipper Shahid Afridi.
Afridi only managed 19 before he sliced Harbhajan to Virender Sehwag at cover-point and at 184 for seven the game was almost up for Pakistan.
Earlier, the 25-year-old Riaz kept his side in the match.
Riaz, on as first change, struck fifth ball when he had dangerman Sehwag, hitting across the line, lbw for 38 including nine boundaries.
Tendulkar, opening with Sehwag, subsequently square-drove Riaz for four to become the first batsman ever to score 400 runs in three separate World Cups.
But off-spinner Saeed Ajmal nearly had him out twice in successive balls for 23, a reviewed lbw and tight stumping call both going against Pakistan.
Then, on 27, Tendulkar pulled leg-spinner Afridi hard to short mid-wicket only for Misbah to drop the catch.
Tendulkar was dropped again, on 45, when Younus at mid-off failed to hold on to a mistimed drive off leg-spinner Afridi.
Riaz, however, had Kohli caught by Umar Akmal at backward point and next ball clean bowled Yuvraj with a swinging full toss.
Tendulkar was given a third reprieve by Pakistan on 70 when wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal failed to hold a tough chance off an edged Afridi leg-break.
And he was on 81 when a leaping Umar Akmal at short mid-wicket dropped a checked drive against off-spinner Hafeez.
However, Afridi ended his innings when he took a sharp catch at short extra-cover off Ajmal. Tendulkar faced 115 balls with 11 fours.
Riaz had Dhoni lbw before completing his five-wicket haul when Zaheer was caught behind.

""Today, our nation and people are afflicted with violence and destructive activities. Such acts must be brought to an end without any further delay and an environment of peace restored in the country,"" King Gyanendra said in a message to the nation, which is celebrating its most important festival - Dasain.
Gyanendra, however, didn't offer any new proposals to revive peace talks with the rebels, which collapsed in August last year. The government has repeatedly urged rebels to return to the negotiating table, but to no avail.
Since they withdrew from peace talks, the rebels have grown increasingly bold in their attacks. In August, they isolated the capital, Katmandu, by threatening to attack vehicles, as part of a campaign to pressure the government into releasing detained insurgents.
The guerrillas, who claim inspiration from Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting for a communist state in Nepal since 1996. More than 10,000 people have died in the insurgency.
However, the rebels and government troops have agreed to a temporary truce during the Dasain festival - during which many Nepalese travel home.
Gyanendra has faced political troubles since becoming the king in 2001, after his brother, Birendra, and eight other members of the royal family were gunned down, allegedly by the crown prince, who then reportedly took his own life.
Earlier this year, protesters took to the streets almost every day to demand the return of democracy. In 2002, the king dissolved parliament and installed a monarchist Cabinet.
Gyanendra eventually gave in to their demands and restored the prime minister he had sacked.
On Saturday, Gyanendra stressed the country's democratic future was at stake.
""In order to end this cycle of devastation, all peace loving people who have faith in multiparty democracy must unite in earnest, with the nation's well-being as the focal point,"" the king said.

Nepal Television said Constituent Assembly members elected Ram Baran Yadav, a physician from the Madheshi ethnic community in southern Nepal, which has been campaigning for greater rights and more say in the administration.
State-run television said an official announcement was expected later in the evening by assembly chairman Kul Bahadur Gurung. Yadav, of the Nepali Congress party, received more than half the votes in the 594-seat assembly that was required to win.
Yadav had the backing of his party, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and Madhesi People's Rights Forum the second, third and fourth largest parties.
Yadav has served twice as the health ministry and elected twice in parliament elections. He has held senior positions in his Nepali Congress party.
Yadav had secured the most votes in initial voting for president on Saturday, but voting went to a second round because none of the three candidates were able to secure the required majority.
His closest opponent, Ramraja Singh, was backed by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), former communist rebels who have emerged as the largest political party in Nepal.
The Maoists won the most seats in the Constituent Assembly in April elections. Since the dissolution of the monarchy, the assembly has been unable to form a new government because the main parties have bickered over forming a ruling coalition.
The president will swear in the new prime minister, who will run the executive branch.

The brazen robbery Wednesday night was the first of its kind at Malaysia's main airport and highlighted the country's worsening crime situation, especially in Kuala Lumpur where muggings and burglaries have become common.
District police chief Zahedi Ayob said police had some leads on the robbery in which four to six men attacked two currency exchange employees as they were about to enter the departure terminal.
The robbers approached the victims from the back and front, firing automatic pistols and grabbing a bag filled with Singapore dollars worth $1US million (euro633,000).
The two money changers, a security escort, a Nepalese bystander and a policeman suffered leg injuries. They were hospitalized and were in stable condition, Zahedi said.
Zahedi said the policeman and the security guard are believed to have returned fire but it was not clear if they shot any of the robbers, who walked to a waiting car and drove away.
The robbers were probably Malaysians, Zahedi said.
Windows at the airport entrance were shattered in the shootout.
Zahedi said police were looking for at least one and possibly two getaway cars. Road blocks set up overnight were lifted but police patrol cars were on alert, he told The Associated Press.
News reports said the currency exchange workers were going in to meet a money changer who was arriving from Singapore when they were robbed.
Earlier reports said six people were injured, but Zahedi said five were hurt.

 Kathmandu, Saturday 30 October: In violation of the cessation of hostilities declared by Maoists during the Dashain festival, the rebels hanged to death one in Dailekh far western Nepal . Fresh reports of abductions by rebels are pouring in from across the country.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 31 Oct 04
A report from Dailekh said Maoists hanged to death Balaram Bishwakarma, 21, of Chaukhada area in Awalparajul VDC-4 village development committee area following his abduction on 22 October, the first day of Dashain.
 Newly recruited to the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), Bishwakarma was under training and had returned home for Dashain. The rebels beat him up and took him around the village the day after abducting him. Villagers came across his body hanging from a tree 6 km from the village on Thursday.  passage omitted
 A report from Sunsari southeastern Nepal says that Sarka Bahadur Bista, a rebel ex-commander, informed that Maoist militia in the eastern region consists of 15 per cent children below 15 years. He also said that Maoists have provision for 10 females in each battalion. Bista has been in the RNA regional headquarters in Itahari since his arrest five months ago.

"6722",2008643,"Title: Royal priest says Nepal 's king 'worried' after accident.rtf; Date: April 16, 2008 Wednesday 1:21 AM GMT; Text: A religious adviser to Nepal's King Gyanendra has revealed that the already embattled monarch has been struck by yet more misfortune.
Not only is the king facing the rapid rise of ultra-republican Maoists who want to sack him, he has also been hit by a terrible omen: a 20-metre (66-foot) pole falling off a wooden chariot.
It may sound trivial to some, but Madhab Bhattarai -- a Hindu priest, guru and close aide to the king since 2002 -- said the tumbling pole was being taken very seriously behind the walls of the royal palace.
""I can guarantee you this is not a good sign for the country,"" said Bhattarai, who is known as a Naayab Bada Guruju, or Great Teacher.
The incident, which left eight people injured, occurred on Sunday during Seto Machhindranath, one of the dozens of annual Hindu festivals widely observed in Nepal.
""This is a bad omen for those who run the nation. It signals that there will be some kind of big accident.
""I have suggested to the palace to perform certain special rituals as they are a bit worried,"" he said of the king and his tight-knit aides.
""We can't prove it scientifically, but people have a strong belief that something bad will happen,"" Bhattarai told AFP in an interview that provided a rare insight into the mind of the deeply superstitious and reclusive king.
The ""bad thing"" appears to be just around the corner.
The count from last week's landmark elections on Nepal's political future is ongoing, but so far former Maoist rebels are on track for a surprise victory.
The Maoists waged a deadly insurgency for a decade to abolish the monarchy, and have vowed to do so as soon as the final results are announced and a new 601-seat constitutional assembly is formed.
""He must be worried deep inside,"" the guru said of Gyanendra.
King Gyanendra is considered by followers to be a reincarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, but he comes from a family beset by catastrophe and misfortune.
He ascended the throne in 2001 when his brother and predecessor, King Birendra, was shot dead at a party along with eight other family members by a drunk and lovelorn crown prince, who in turn killed himself.
In 2005 he seized absolute power to fight the Maoists, only to fuel a wave of republican sentiment and a historic 2006 peace deal that led to the polls.
Last year his son and heir, Crown Prince Paras, was rushed to hospital after suffering a massive heart attack. The 36-year-old prince survived, but was told to end his playboy lifestyle.
Gyanendra has also been stripped of all his powers, including his role as head of state and army commander in the wake of the peace deal.
Last week the Maoists told him to either adapt to life as a ""common citizen"" in one of the world's poorest countries, or face trial and ""strong punishment.""
The royal guru said he was now deeply worried for the future of Nepal and the Hindu faith, practised by 80 percent of the country's people.
Nepal is home to several important Hindu pilgrimage sites, and the Himalayas that form the country's border with Chinese-controlled Tibet are believed to be the abodes of dozens of Hindu gods and goddesses.
""There is only one Hindu king in the world and he is an important symbol as the protector of Hindu religion,"" said Bhattarai, who was speaking at his modest Kathmandu office.
""There is a belief that many gods and goddesses live in the physical body of the king. If the king is no longer there, the Hindu religion could be threatened,"" he warned.
And the king must share some of the blame, his spiritual advisor admitted.
""Earlier kings used to take care of old temples and construct new ones, but the present king didn't give much importance to such things,"" said Bhattarai.
""His weakness was that he didn't do enough for Hinduism and he was too involved in politics.""

"737",20033311,"Title: Americans in Asia on alert for Iraq war backlash.rtf; Date: February 23, 2003 Sunday; Text: With a new war in Iraq looming on the horizon, US embassies, military bases, schools and companies in the Asia-Pacific region are bracing for a potentially violent anti-American backlash.
Security for hundreds of thousands of US civilians, diplomats and servicemen in the region has been stepped up since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US and last October's Bali bombings, but Washington is taking no chances.
The State Department issued a ""worldwide caution"" on February 6 reminding US citizens of a ""heightened risk"" of terrorist attacks including suicide operations, assassinations or kidnappings. It cited a ""growing threat"" that non-conventional weapons including chemical or biological agents might be used.
With security now hardened at US facilities, Americans were warned that attacks may be aimed at ""softer"" targets such as residential areas, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, outdoor recreation events and beaches.
They have been advised to steer clear of protests, which have taken on a strident anti-American character amid popular opposition to President George W. Bush's threat to attack Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
Various security measures have been drawn up by US facilities in the region against terrorist threats and other emergencies, with host governments providing additional protection:
-- In Singapore, Gurkha sentries help guard the fortified US embassy, the Singapore American School, which has 3,000 students, and the American Club.
The Gurkhas, part of an elite security force from Nepal employed for years by Singapore to help protect its leaders and key buildings, were assigned to protect potential terrorist targets after the September 2001 attacks.
""The situation is being assessed constantly, and should there be a need, the level of vigilance can be stepped up further,"" said Singapore's ministry of home affairs.
There are about 15,000 American residents in Singapore and some 1,500 US companies operate in the city-state, long reputed to be an expatriate safe haven. But complacency was shattered after Singapore said it had uncovered terrorist cells plotting to bomb US and other foreign targets.
Thirty-one men have been arrested on suspicion of being members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a regional group linked to terrorist supremo Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, but others remain at large in Southeast Asia.
-- In Malaysia, some 11,000 to 12,000 Americans are living in the Muslim-majority country, where anti-American sentiment has been fanned by US threats to attack Iraq.
""We're telling people they should always have medical records, school records, financial records, passports and money handy in the event they would have to return to the US immediately,"" US embassy spokesman Frank Whittaker said, but he stressed that ""we have full confidence in the Malaysian government.""
-- In Hong Kong, where some 32,000 US nationals reside, Americans have also been advised to keep vital documents ready.
Police patrol the vicinity of the US consulate, as well as other US institutions, but a police spokesman said the assessed terror risk level remained on the low side of moderate.
-- In Australia, security for the estimated 100,000 American residents has been stepped up since September 2001.
""It has been increased in ways that people can see and in ways that they wouldn't see,"" said an official at the US consulate in Sydney.
He said the consulate and the US embassy in Canberra were protected by police.
-- The Philippines, a former US colony, hosts some 120,000 American nationals. It is troubled by communist rebels and Islamic separatists and bandits.
US embassy spokeswoman Karen Kelley said the mission was continuously evaluating the situation, and the State Department has a standing warning to avoid certain areas where Muslim groups allegedly linked to al-Qaeda operate.
-- An estimated 10,000-11,000 US citizens live in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country. After the Bali bombings in October some 350 embassy staff and families were evacuated and about 95 staffers remain.
The embassy closed for six days last September over a reported threat from the al-Qaeda network. A concrete barricade was installed to seal off part of the main street outside the compound when it reopened.
Leading international schools in Jakarta closed for two weeks last November over reported terrorist threats. They were heavily guarded by armed police and private security staff when they reopened.
-- In largely Muslim Pakistan, where armed militants have targetted Westerners, the US embassy has been without dependents and non-essential staff since March 2002, when a US embassy employee's wife and her daughter were killed in a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad.
The US embassy has tightened security since September 2001, and only a few hundred American citizens remain in the country. The US consulate in Karachi has been operating out of a secret location since August.

It has two roles, to open up wasteland and protect the frontiers, both aspects of national security. In peacetime the farming role becomes more important, and in times of tension the security role is more important. The two roles are inseparable. The corps is the biggest state organization on the mainland, after the People's Liberation Army. It has a unique status, with its own courts and legal system, and is subject to the authority of the PLA - not the regional government. Text of report by Mark O'Neill: ""Corps values endure on the mainland's Wild West frontier"", carried by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post web site on 8 November
 Fifty years ago, Mao Zedong ordered 175,000 soldiers to settle in the far western region of Xinjiang to secure the area for China against warlords, Kuomintang troops, Soviet and American agents, and those fighting for independence and an Islamic republic.
South China Morning Post web site, Hong Kong, in English 8 Nov 04
Half a century later, China enjoys good relations with its neighbours, the Taleban government has gone, and the military threat is negligible. But the body Mao created - the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) - has grown into one of the biggest institutions in China, with 2.54 million members, 1,500 companies and responsibility for 2,000km of the region's border.
 It is the only one of the 12 production and construction corps - all part of the People's Liberation Army - which China set up in the 1960s and 70s that still survives. Beijing abolished the others between 1972 and 1976.
 Why should the corps still exist when China's control over the region is more secure than it has ever been? None of its neighbours support the recreation of a separate government - the Republic of East Turkestan - that existed briefly before it was crushed by the communist army when it entered the region in 1949. All cooperate with Beijing in opposing such a state and hand back ""terrorists"" suspected of carrying out attacks.
 According to official figures, between 1990 and 2003, ""terrorists"" killed 160 civil servants and religious figures in Xinjiang, while the security forces killed 110 ""terrorists"" and dismantled 560 of their organizations.
 ""Compared to the early and mid-1990s, the threat of separatism has diminished,"" Wang Lequan, Communist Party chief of Xinjiang and political chief of the XPCC since December 1995, said last month. ""In recent years, friendly neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Russia have handed back many of these terrorists.""
 The exile movement of the Uighurs - the largest minority in Xinjiang with about 40 per cent of the population of 18 million - is weak and divided and lacks a leader with the charisma and global status of the Dalai Lama.
 Unlike the Tibetan leader, leaders of Uighur movements do not meet heads of state and are not invited to prime-time television shows. Beijing wages an unrelenting diplomatic and political war against them.
 In September, on the steps of the US Capitol building in Washington, a group of Uighur exiles announced the formation of a government-in-exile. The event was attended by just two media - the Far Eastern Economic Review and an official Chinese newspaper that will print nothing about it. Other Uighur exiled groups distanced themselves from the event.
 Despite this greatly reduced political and security threat, Zhang Qingli, the commander of the XPCC since October 1999, insisted that the corps was essential.
 ""The XPCC will live for a long time,"" he says. ""As long as we have enemies in the world who want us dead, as long as Xinjiang has separatists and religious extremists causing trouble, the corps will live forever. It has two roles, to open up wasteland and protect the frontiers, both an aspect of national security. In peacetime the farming role becomes more important, and in times of tension the security role is more important. The two roles are inseparable.""
 The corps is the biggest state organization on the mainland, after the People's Liberation Army. It has a unique status, with its own courts and legal system, and is subject to the authority of the PLA - not the regional government.
 In times of peace, the problems Mr Zhang has to deal with are less about border protection and catching bombers than the headaches of a city mayor or chief executive of a giant company. Like the state units of the Maoist era, it runs nurseries, schools, hospitals, old people's homes and many welfare services.
 Of the corps members, 450,000 are retired and 900,000 work, which means that only two active ones support one retired. But Mr Zhang has no powers to collect taxes or raise the corps' revenue.

Her mother-in-law allegedly ran a brothel in their house, something that was beyond her comprehension. She managed to run away to Nepal, where her parents lived, thrice, but there was no escaping her predicament. Each time she was sent back. ""I cried because I wanted to play like other children. My aunt's advice might have been harsh but it was the stark truth. She told me that either I should fight my fate or simply die. That's when I stopped running away and started confronting reality,"" said Fatima in the first regional meeting of sex trafficking survivors that took place in Delhi on Tuesday.
Fatima now helps run the Kasturba Gandhi Girls Hostel in Araria funded by the Bihar government as part of their 'Education for all' programme. The hostel provides shelter to about 50 girls - daughters of scheduled caste farmers and human trafficking victims. The girls are vulnerable and run the risk of being forced into flesh trade. They are sent to school till class VIII.
Human trafficking victims and survivors from India, Nepal, the Philippines, as well as, advocates from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia attended the meeting, which was organized by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific and Apne Aap Worldwide.
According to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) figures, there are currently three million human trafficking victims in India - 1.2 million of them are children. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) figures indicate that the average age of those who fall victim to human trafficking is between nine and 13 years. There has been a staggering rise in the number of persons involved in human trafficking in the country - the figure has increased 17 times in the past decade.
A human trafficking survivor from the Philippines, Alma Bulawan, said, ""I was coerced into the trade by my brother in Olangopo near a military base. Iwas employed as a waitress in a bar and was forced to entertain the guests. Our manager would let us turn down a customer."" Alma now runs a dropin centre for women in prostitution in the Philippines. ""I started working as an organizer even though the salary was a pittance as there were so many women around me who were suffering. I did not want others to meet the same fate that I did because of the absence of a support system,"" she said.
The message that was hammered home was that both the survivors and support organizations against human trafficking were stoutly opposed to any bid to legalize prostitution. ""We want the section 5 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act to be made more stringent so that the buyers of sex are given punishment and the section 8 of the Act, which punishes women workers who are actually victims, to be deleted. We need to focus on punishing the buyers and pimps and provide assistance to the victims,"" said Ruchira Gupta, founder of Apne Aap Worldwide.

Dressed in green uniforms generally worn by Chinese soldiers, the half-dozen protesters carrying water pistols loaded with red paint were quickly detained by Nepalese police in Katmandu.
The demonstrators were joined by 200 others, many of them Buddhist monks and nuns, in front of the Chinese Embassy's visa office in the heart of the city.
""Stop killing in Tibet,"" and ""Free Tibet,"" the protesters chanted before being rounded up by police and taken away in vans and trucks. Police official Hom Chauhan said more than 200 Tibetans were detained.
China says 22 people died in anti-government violence in Tibet's capital of Lhasa in March, while foreign Tibet supporters say many times that number were killed in the protests and a subsequent crackdown.
Tibetans in Nepal began protests against China in March but temporarily halted their rallies last month after the Tibetan government-in-exile based in India asked them to stop because of the major earthquake in China.
The protests resumed last week.
Nepalese officials say demonstrations against friendly nations, including China, will not be allowed and Tibetan refugees are barred from all political activities.
China says it has ruled Tibet for centuries, although many Tibetans say their homeland was essentially an independent state for most of that time. Chinese communist troops occupied Tibet in 1951.

China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the United States already have observer status with the eight-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and will send representatives for the first time this year.
Foreign secretaries meeting ahead of the regional forum, which gets underway here Tuesday, unanimously recommended that Iran's request for such status be accepted, the Press Trust of India said.
The request will now be considered on Monday by South Asian foreign ministers, Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon said.
Tensions between Tehran and the West are running high over its capture of 15 British naval personnel in the Gulf last week, with relations already strained over Iran's refusal to halt nuclear enrichment.
The meeting of foreign secretaries also reviewed the progress of panels formed under the grouping.
New Delhi has repeatedly called for improvements in trade, travel and telecommunications links among members of SAARC, long held hostage by hostility between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan.
""Economic connectivity ... for us is very important,"" India's Menon said earlier.
Menon said the summit will focus on travel, telecommunications and energy links in the region, which is home to nearly 1.4 billion people.
SAARC is made up of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan will be formally inducted as the eighth member of the organisation.
The regional body has made little progress since its formation in 1985, largely because of tensions between India and Pakistan which have fought three wars, two over the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. 
But analysts said the SAARC meeting could be more positive this time because of improving ties between New Delhi and Islamabad thanks to a formal peace process launched in 2004.
""The current orientation of cirumstances is far more favourable for SAARC than ever before,"" said security expert Uday Bhaskar.
""This time there seems to be a shift in the mood all over. There has been a change in India-Pakistan relations and economic growth in the region,"" said South Asia expert Sukh Deo Muni.
Experts said the presence of observers from leading countries with economic stakes in the region will also put pressure on South Asian countries to make progress.
Despite an air of goodwill, analysts warned against expecting breakthroughs.
""There will still be limited progress as many countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan are caught up in internal conflict that will restrict the way they relate to collective objectives,"" Bhaskar said.
Last year, the South Asian Free Trade Agreement came into effect on January 1, aiming to create the world's biggest free-trade area. But the volume of trade among SAARC countries remains low at around five percent of their total.
India has said combating terrorism will also figure in the talks.
Terrorism ""is something that has affected us and it has affected other members. Sri Lanka has told us very strongly they intend to raise this,"" Menon said.
New Delhi has voiced concern over the first-ever air raid by Tamil Tiger rebels in the island last Monday and said the conflict will figure in the summit.
""We hope to use our conversations over the next week or so... to encourage the Sri Lankans themselves to find solutions to this tragic conflict,"" Menon said.
The Tigers and Sri Lankan forces have been locked in a new wave of fighting since December 2005 that has claimed over 4,000 lives. Over 60,000 people have died in the conflict since 1972.
Menon added India and Pakistan would hold talks on the sidelines on such issues as cross-border militancy in Kashmir.
""We must stop terrorism and we must do it together,"" said Menon, who accused Pakistan of not doing enough to halt the flow of Islamic guerrillas into revolt-hit Indian Kashmir.

The commission has remained closed for a month after a professors union padlocked it protesting the government's appointment of commission members without ""proper consultations.""
The World Bank has warned to withdraw financial support, said Subash Chandra Dhungel, chief of administration at the commission, at a programme organised by the Education Journalists Network here today.
UCPN-Maoist-aligned Nepal National Professors Organisation (NNPO) had padlocked the commission offices on May 18 protesting the government's appointment of Ganesh Gurung as chairperson and Bhola Pokharel as member secretary.
Dhungel stated that due to the closure, scholarship programmes, research projects, physical infrastructure development initiatives and regular grants for community colleges have been hit.
NNPO Secretary Purna Lamichhane defended his organisation's move to shutdown the commission. ""The government made the appointments without securing a political consensus,"" he said adding that his union was ready to talk to the Education Minister to resolve the issue. Bijaya Silwal, president of UML-aligned Nepal Progressive Professors Organisation, said that since UCPN-Maoist was also a partner in the coalition, NNPO should accept government decisions.

"208",20031554,"Title: Bollywood relives horror of 1999 passenger plane hijack to Afghanistan.rtf; Date: September 22, 2003 Monday; Text: Bollywood will this week bring to the screens the horrors of trapped passengers with a drama based on the 1999 hijacking of an Indian plane by Islamic militants to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
India's film industry will put aside its standard song-and-dance routine for ""Zameen"" (""Earth"") which opens Friday starring top actor Ajay Devgan, current Bollywood favourite Bipasha Basu and Abhishek Bachchan, son of screen legend Amitabh Bachchan.
While the saga among the passengers and crew is fictional, the plot is outlined on the hijacking of Indian Airlines flight 814 which left Kathmandu on December 24, 1999, with 124 passengers onboard.
Five hijackers diverted the flight over the Indian city of Lucknow and by Christmas morning the plane had been taken to Amritsar, Lahore, Dubai and finally Kandahar, then the stronghold of the Taliban.
One passenger was killed and 25 others released, but the others spent a week in Kandahar until India's then-foreign minister Jaswant Singh flew to the southern Afghan city and traded the hostages for three jailed Islamic extremists.
One of the militants Singh handed over was British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, now on death row in Pakistan for last year's gruesome murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.
""Zameen,"" the work of well-known producer N.R. Pachisia, marks Devgan's first role based on a real-life incident.
The star, who has played a variety of roles over his career, stars as an army officer dealing with the militants.
""No songs have been pictured of me in this film. This is a complete commercial action film with no nonsense,"" Devgan said.
Basu, one of Bollywood's leading actresses, plays the key role of an air hostess in charge of calming down the passengers.
""My character is essentially to manage the tense situation when the terrorists hijack the plane,"" Basu said.
""For the first time in my career, I have done a role where I am dealing with terrorists who have hijacked a plane. It was a great experience,"" she said.
""Zameen"" was shot at a cost of 150 million rupees (3.26 million dollars). To create an authentic atmosphere, producers rented out an airport at Latur in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.
The film is expected to give a needed boost to Abishek Bachchan, who has more than 10 films to his credit but has not had a hit in several years. His last film ""Kuch Naa Kaho"" (""Don't Say A Word"") had a lukewarm reception at the box office.
But the industry expects ""Zameen"" to be a hit thanks in part to the popularity of Basu and Devgan.
""It is an action film. If you see the film on big screen you will love it. I am sure people will love this film,"" said Pachisia.
""Bachchan in an action role will be loved just like the way his father Amitabh Bachchan was. He has the action mettle in him.""

In a statement made through a spokesman, the secretary general said he remained ""convinced that there is no alternative to the continuation of dialogue and a peaceful solution to the conflict.""

Doctors at Model hospital in Katmandu said three people were killed more than 40 were in critical condition, mostly with head injuries, after police fired rubber-bullets and live rounds at the crowd. The doctors spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
The capital city had been poised for confrontation, with soldiers and police patrolling the streets as an estimated 30,000 protesters from surrounding areas headed toward the city limits, where troops had orders to shoot on sight anyone breaking the curfew.
Demonstrators marched toward Katmandu from several directions. The clash occurred in the Kalanki neighborhood on the western edge of the city, said Kunjan Aryal of INSEC-Nepal, a Katmandu-based rights group.
Thousands protested just outside the curfew area in the suburb of Gangabu, watched by a line of police and soldiers.
District administration officers said the 2 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew was necessary to prevent opposition parties from holding a huge rally Thursday to demand that King Gyanendra loosen his grip on power.
Residents in parts of central Katmandu came out onto their roofs, whistling and banging plates. People used mobile phones to call each other and send text messages, trying to draw each other out for demonstrations.
""We are ready to sacrifice our lives for the nation because we are about to be killed, but we are not concerned about that. It is for the nation and without the nation there is no life,"" said Sangam Poudel, a 22-year-old student.
Diplomats, journalists and human rights monitors were refused passes allowing them onto the streets as they had been in the past. Police tried to keep the media and rights workers away from any protests, escorting some foreign journalists back to their hotels.
A foreign diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the restriction on passes was intended to keep observers journalists, rights activists and diplomats from seeing what was going on in the streets.
Still, opposition leaders met on Thursday and decided to go ahead with the protest.
Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress party said there would be rallies at Katmandu's major entry points, where protesters would try to break through police lines.
About 5,000 protesters rallied in Kirtipur, just southwest of Katmandu, on Thursday morning, local resident Arun Giri said by telephone. There is no curfew in the farming suburb.
Gyanendra, meanwhile, met with a special envoy sent by neighboring India at the royal palace in the heart of Katmandu, state-run Nepal television said. Karan Singh was in the palace for two hours, according to the report. Details of the meeting were not immediately available.
India, a burgeoning global power that does not want chaos on its doorstep, sent Singh on Wednesday to press the king to reach a compromise with the parties. The parties want a new constitution that would limit or eliminate the monarchy's role.
Before meeting the king, Singh met several opposition leaders.
Two weeks of often violent protests and a general strike against palace rule have paralyzed the Himalayan kingdom, leaving cities short of food and fuel and Nepal at its most volatile since Gyanendra seized power 14 months ago.
The royal government has responded harshly, claiming that communist insurgents now allied with the opposition have infiltrated rallies to instigate violence. Police have beaten, tear gassed and arrested thousands of protesters.
Security forces have killed at least 13 people, including some pro-democracy protesters shot dead Wednesday, since the opposition launched a general strike in the Himalayan kingdom on April 6.
Officials claimed security forces opened fire Wednesday only after being shot at during an assault by brick-throwing protesters in Chandragadi, about 310 miles southeast of Katmandu.
The government has made such claims in the past, but no shootings by protesters have been independently verified.
The region's chief administrator, Bhola Siwakoti, said the demonstrators had defied a ban on protests and were looting.
""The events show how desperate the present royal regime is. It is becoming paranoid,"" said Dhruba Adhikary of the independent Nepal Press Institute. ""The movement is getting popular. It is expanding and growing.""

Fourteen U.N. peacekeepers were wounded in the attack in Garamba National Park, near Congo's borders with Sudan and Uganda in the region of Ituri, U.N. spokesman Kemal Saiki said. He had no information the attackers' identities, but said rebels from Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army were known to operate in the region.
The gunfight broke out around dawn and lasted for about four hours until a helicopter-borne Nepalese contingent arrived in support, said U.N. spokeswoman Jennifer Bakody by telephone from Bunia, eastern Congo.
The U.N. troops involved in the attack were from Guatemala, she said.
There was no information on casualties, if any, among the attackers.
Some 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers are helping provide security in Congo and monitor peace deals.
But thousands of militiamen still roam Ituri, where clashes between ethnic Lendu and Hema militia have killed more than 50,000 people since 1999 in a conflict that became a bloody spin-off of Congo's larger 1998-2002 war.
In separate fighting Sunday, renegade former army soldiers in Congo ambushed U.N. peacekeepers with mortars in a hilltop banana plantation, sparking a fighting that left four of the attackers dead, U.N. officials said.
The peacekeepers were conducting an operation to flush the militants out of territory they captured during a slew of raids this week near Rwindi, said U.N. military spokesman Mayank Awasthi.
Rwindi is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of the regional capital, Goma, near the Rwandan border.
In February, Lendu militiamen in northern Ituri killed nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers as they attempted to disarm their camp.
Following the incident, U.N. peacekeepers killed at least 75 militiamen in operations to dismantle camps and purge Ituri of years-long terror and violence.
The Ituri conflict was a bloody spin-off of Congo's larger five-year war that involved six African armies and killed nearly 4 million people, mostly through war-induced starvation and disease.
Congo's shaky transitional government is attempting to shepherd peace throughout the enormous country, but the long arm of the law has been slow to reach the volatile east.
The first presidential elections in decades are expected this year in the vast nation, when Congolese will choose a new government to replace a postwar transitional administration.

"7634",20113509,"Title: Beyond stereotypical Nepali cinema.rtf; Date: November 12, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU, Nov. 12 -- After watching Prashant Rasaily's ""Acharya"" almost a month and half ago, I thought I would not earn an opportunity to be mesmerized by any other Nepali film for at least a year.
But Nir Shah's ""Masaan,"" a film based on the play written by the late litterateur Gopal Prasad Rimal puts all my uncertainty to vain.
If we are to take an example of the film that can reach out to the inner souls of the filmgoers without any fancy props, breathtaking locations, peppy numbers and visual magic, Masaan is the one in the case.
Unlike elsewhere, Nepali silver screen has hardly explored much beyond the commercial way of filmmaking. While Hollywood and Bollywood have many films based on the great works of literature or on the real life stories from the yesteryears, Nepali movie fraternity does not even have handful such movies to look up to.
Some of the films based on literature like Prem Pinda, Basanti and Muna Madan did create its own niche in the market.
However, such films became once in a blue moon thing to the audiences while industry got primarily dominated by the stereotype commercial cinemas.
In such scenarios, a prominent actor and filmmaker like Nir Shah to take up one of the verypopular plays written by a veteran writer like Rimal and to project it with cinematic values is a work that certainly deserves a special mention.
Though for many it may seem like a movie based on a book would not need much of an effort, the reality however is exactly the vice versa.
For any filmmaker making such a movie, it is no less than a Herculean job to ensure that the movie does impartiality to the original script; does not kill the essence of the writer.
Nir Shah has carefully taken note of this and eighty percent of the movie poignantly stays close to Gopal Prasad Rimal's play while the remaining twenty percent comes along with a little bit of cinematic touches.
Yes, it is true that Nir Shah's Masaan is not exactly a feature film and perhaps for those who cannot keep their eyes off Rajesh Hamal, Nikhil Uprety and Rekha Thapa, this is not the right movie to go for.
For some others watching Masaan may feel like watching a play inside a cinema hall. The film does lack cinematic elements like soundtracks, cinematography, dance and melodrama if we are to compare it with any other full-length commercial film.
But look at it with a different perspective and you will find out how tightly the screenplay proceeds and how the movie pays homage to the great literary piece by Gopal Prasad Rimal.
Nir Shah does not fool around with the script and conceivably almost each dialogue in the film holds deep gravities and takes us back to the time when the writer had written the play.
From the setup to the costumes and props, the director of the movie heads extremely close in creating the mood to go along with Rimal's play and succeeds mostly.
Since the dialogues are directly taken from the play, it was indispensable to have the right characters to deliver them.
The primary three characters of the film - Raj Ballav Koirala, Keki Adhikary and Nita Dhungana - take the best out of them to justify the characters while each of them projects their part with poise and eloquence. Nothing seems to have been overdone.
In fact, this is by far the best Raj Ballav has delivered among the movies he has done so far. For a person who is more of a philosopher and poet than an actor in real life, Masaan allows him enough space to take the real out of him. Both Keki Adhikary and Nita Dhungana are a treat to watch.
They steal the show largely. Other supporting actors like Keshav Bhattarai, Rashmi Bhatta, Subhadra Adhikary, Shyam Rai, Palpasa Dangol, Dipak Chhetri and Dinesh DC share the screen promisingly.
The self-centered men of the time, the sexual desires in them and the exploitation of women in the domestic circle is what Rimal's play is about and it is what Nir Shah brings out with striking colors on the cinematic canvas.
The movie jointly produced by Rimal Enterprises -owned by the family members of the late Gopal Prasad Rimal - Nir Shah and Rudrarth Rana (Nir Shah's grandson) for less than six million Rupees and without the typecast gimmicks stands out from all those ""commercially successful"" Nepali cinemas.
All in all, Nir Shah who loves to call his films ""Nircinema"" if he loves his work in it, makes a strong comeback in the industry with his matured experiences and new implementations.
Screening at QFX Cinemas.

"2585",20043381,"Title: Asian foreign ministers work on salvaging trade deal at Thai talks.rtf; Date: February 8, 2004 Sunday; Text: Asian foreign ministers met here Sunday to salvage a free trade agreement and work towards bridging South and Southeast Asia, a region of nearly two billion people, officials said.
Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai said in an opening speech that the seven-nation BIMSTEC grouping was ""the logical linking mechanism to bring together various interlocking pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that is Asia.""
But plans for a free trade deal to be signed by the five founding members -- Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- were jeopardised Saturday when Bangladesh pulled out after demanding compensation in return for abolishing tariffs.
""Bangladesh is not in a position to sign,"" Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Saturday, shortly after the host nation opened trade ministers' talks by saying an agreement had been reached.
""Bangladesh did not want to be an obstacle to the signing of the agreement so they said -- you go ahead and sign and we can join later,"" Sihasak said.
But with only four of the seven-nation bloc now able to sign, the foreign ministers will discuss Sunday whether they should now aim instead for all seven members to ink the deal at a summit planned for July, he said.
Incoming members Nepal and Bhutan were not part of the trade negotiations and had already been invited to join at a later date.
Sources at the talks said delegates were ""flummoxed"" by Bangladesh's proposal which they said did not outline in detail how they would be compensated.
They said that other member nations, particularly Sri Lanka which has already agreed on a free trade deal with India, tried unsuccessfully to convince them that their concerns could be addressed within the agreement.
Surakiart said in his opening speech that the BIMSTEC proposal, which would slash tariffs to zero by 2012 for the more-developed members and give less-developed nations a further five-year grace period, was part of a trend towards unfettered trade in Asia.
""This network of functional cooperation, while embryonic, has the potential, in time, to develop into an Asian economic community,"" he said, referring to the web of agreements, dialogues and joint projects signed in recent years.
""BIMSTEC is poised to fulfill its promise of bridging South and Southeast Asia and elevating the relationship onto a higher plane of cooperation.""
Nepal and Bhutan were Sunday formally admitted to the grouping, represented by their foreign ministers who both wore nation dress -- Bhutan's Lyonpo Khandu Wanchuk resplendent in a knee-length checkered robe cinched at the waist.
Sihasak said the foreign ministers' talks would focus on establishing a common position on terrorism, and finding ways to cooperate to fight infectious diseases like the bird flu which has swept across Asia.
""It's been agreed that we need to work closer together on terrorism and transnational crime, and infectious diseases like SARS and bird flu. The foreign ministers will discuss how to take this further,"" he said.
""I think they will recognise that the challenge now is not just the traditional security issues.""
The bird flu outbreak has killed 18 people in Vietnam and Thailand and emerged in poultry in eight other Asian nations, only a year after the SARS epidemic caused panic as it swept the region.

Excerpt from unattributed report headlined ""Nepal party cadres angry at selection of proportional poll candidates"" published by Nepalese newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 4 April
Kathmandu: Political party workers have expressed dissatisfaction after political parties nominated their representatives to the constituent assembly under the proportional electoral system.
The anger has been expressed in Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist, Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist Leninist, Madheshi People's Rights Forum and Nepal Sadbhavana Party.
According to our correspondent in Jhapa district, Maoist cadres vandalized and torched their own office, angry over the selection of the party representative. They attacked the Maoist office the No 1 regional office located at Char Ali of Jhapa district. The workers vandalized the office complaining that the name of Chandra Lal Meche was not included in the list of candidates submitted to the election commission. The angry workers have demanded the party to alter the list within 24 hours. The Maoist supporters from the Meche minority community took torched the office furniture. They obstructed the East-West highway at Char Ali section for three hours.
Similarly, Nepali Congress worker Hari Priya Bhandari has resigned from all the posts and ordinary membership of the party saying that she was not satisfied with the way in which the party selected candidates under the proportional representation system. She alleged that the party chose the candidates on the basis of favouritism. This injustice within the party has raised the need of a regional party in the far western region.
According to the Baglung correspondent, dissatisfied youths of the Communist Party of Nepal- UML have vandalized the district office of the party in Baglung saying that nobody had been included in the list of the candidates under the proportional representation system. The mob hurled papers, furniture, telephone and clock from the office. The vandalism happened after the party office was closed at five in the afternoon, said the party's district secretary Janak Paudel. He said all the articles of the office were damaged including important papers and furniture. Eyewitnesses said the party activists affiliated to Democratic National Youth Organization had carried out the vandalism.
The names of Rishiram Sharma, Krishna Pathak and Govinda Nepali had been recommended for the PR (proportional representation) list. But none of them had been nominated to the election commission, inviting the violence.
According to the correspondent from Inaruwa [Sunsari district], workers of the Madheshi People's Rights Forum have threatened to rebel alleging that deserving candidates were not nominated to the election commission. District committees of the forum alleged that those who could pay hefty sums were nominated to the election commission. They have questioned the leadership of Upendra Yadav and warned of rebellion.
Sunsari, Morang, Jhapa, Saptari and Siraha district committees of the party have threatened with rebellion. The district committee officials held an emergency meeting and demanded that the party include the nominees recommended by them within three days. If the decision is not reviewed, they said they would start a rebellion.
Eastern regional coordinator of the Forum SN Mehta said the voice of the grassroots workers were not heeded as the leaders decided under the influence of money.
Likewise, the Democratic Tharu Association has protested the nomination by the political parties saying the tribal Tharus had not been represented. Fourteen per cent Tharus live in Sunsari district but they were not fairly represented, the Tharu activists said. Chief of the Association Bhadra Narayan Chaudhary warned of strong protests unless the political parties correct their mistake within three days. [Passage omitted: more cadres resign]

"4502",20064580,"Title: Foreign Sales by U.S. Arms Makers Doubled in a Year.rtf; Date: November 11, 2006 Saturday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Sales of military weapons by United States contractors to foreign governments doubled in the last year, as countries like Pakistan, Australia and Greece stepped up purchases of armaments and the United States government loosened policies to allow more American weapons to be sold on the world market. 
  A total of $21 billion in arms sales agreements were signed from September 2005 to September 2006, compared with $10.6 billion in the previous year, according to new data compiled by the Pentagon. Foreign military sales agreements have typically ranged from $10 billion to $13 billion a year since 2001.
 A number of factors are behind the surge in sales. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration has used arms sales as a way to reward allies and cement international relationships. Middle Eastern countries, flush with oil revenues, have become big buyers. 
  Countries like India, Pakistan and Indonesia that were once barred from buying American weapons have had those bans lifted, and some have placed big orders. 
  For military contractors, the sales have provided a welcome source of new revenue at a time when the Pentagon has indicated that the era of record military budgets is ending. 
  Because many of the weapons sold overseas are mature products, the profit margins to American arms makers are high, since the initial development costs have long been recuperated. 
  And in the case of some planes, like the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet and the C-17 Globemaster cargo plane, foreign military sales are a way to keep open production lines that might close for lack of Pentagon orders. 
  ''There have been a remarkable number of orders placed,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jeffries & Company. ''It's another arrow in the quiver of military contractors.'' 
  One of the biggest orders was placed by Pakistan, which had been barred from buying most American weapons because of its nuclear program. That ban was lifted last year and the country placed a $5 billion order for advanced F-16 jets made by the Lockheed Martin Corporation. 
  A similar ban on India was also lifted, opening up a potentially lucrative market to American contractors. India is currently looking to buy up to 126 new fighter jets, and American contractors have been flying to India to show off their wares. 
  Oil profits are also behind some of the orders. Saudi Arabia said in July that it planned to spend $5.8 billion on American weapons to modernize its National Guard and will also put in more than $3 billion in orders for Black Hawk helicopters, Abrams and Bradley armored land vehicles, new radio systems and other weapons. 
  In the gulf region, Bahrain, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have filed plans to buy Black Hawk helicopters -- for a total of $1 billion. Oman plans to buy a $48 million anti-tank missile system. The Emirates plans to buy rocket artillery equipment and military trucks for $752 million and Bahrain will purchase Javelin missiles for $42 million.
  Bahrain alone has accounted for $1 billion in foreign military sales in the five years since 9/11. 
  ''The rise in oil prices has allowed countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to increase their arms purchases dramatically,'' said William Hartung, director of the arms trade project at the World Policy Institute, which is part of the New School in New York. 
  For contractors, Mr. Hartung added, these sales ''are a welcome windfall, not just icing on the cake.'' 
  These new big gulf region orders, like the Saudi deal, were not included in the $21 billion tally for 2006. They will be carried over into the 2007 tally and are a sign that next year will be as robust as this one. 
  ''We've got a good start on 2007,'' said Lt. Gen. Jeffrey B. Kohler, director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which manages foreign military sales.
  Besides Pakistan and India, since 9/11, bans on arms sales have been lifted on Tajikistan, Serbia and Montenegro, Armenia and Azerbaijan as these countries have been identified by the State Department as critical allies in the war on terror. They have turned into buyers, although on a much smaller scale than the big Pakistani or Saudi orders.
  Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan had no American arms purchases before 9/11. But as a group, they have bought $32 million in weapons under the foreign military sales program, according to statistics from the Center for Defense Information. 
  Foreign military sales are negotiated directly between the United States and other governments and are overseen by the State Department, the Pentagon and Congress. 
  Other strategically situated countries have also stepped up their purchases. Nepal, for instance, bought $1.1 million of American weapons in the full decade before 9/11, and $22 million in the five years since.
  Similarly, Yemen, Djibouti and Uzbekistan bought $16.4 million combined in the decade before 9/11, and $73 million of Ameri"

A UN spokesman said here Wednesday that the troop movements were made possible by the arrival in the country of a unit of Pakistani soldiers, bringing to 3,500 the number of UN soldiers in Ituri province.
He added that with the expected arrival of Nepalese troops, the strength in Ituri province should soon reach 5,000.
Meanwhile, the head of the UN Organization Mission in the DRC ( MONUC) said in a press release that the troops would move out to several sectors outside of the headquarters town of Bunia in Ituri province as part of a program called ""Bunia Without Weapons.""
William Lacy Swing, the mission's chief, said he would visit Kashele where the bodies of 65 persons, mostly women and children, were discovered Tuesday. He vowed that perpetrators of the massacre would be brought to justice.
The unstable region has been beset by reprisal killings between the Hema and Lendu. The 3,000-strong UN mission was deployed to the region last month in a bid to stop the tribal clashes.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 18 March
Kathmandu, [Monday] 17 March: At least nine Tibetan protesters  were injured in a clash between the police and agitators gathered in front of the UN House in Pulchowk Monday. Tibetan protesters  reached the UN building to submit a memorandum at the UN seeking international pressure on China against the crackdown in Lhasa.
The clash erupted after demonstrators refused to stop protests and leave the premises of UN House at about 9:30 am Monday, according to police. Police resorted to baton charge and fired tear gas shells to disperse protesters.
A Tibetan volunteer, who participated in the rally, said they rushed at least five injured persons to hospital. Two of the injured are currently undergoing treatment at Patan Hospital, while three others have been admitted to TU [Tribhuvan University] Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj.
""Police indiscriminately resorted to baton charge and lobbed tear gas shells, inflicting head injury on many protesters,"" he alleged, preferring anonymity.
Police also arrested at least 48 persons including five monks and a nun in the ensuing clash. Three persons including a monk among the arrested were critically injured. They were admitted at Birendra Police Hospital following repeated requests from the arrested.
The agitating Tibetans also held peaceful demonstration in front of the UN House at about 1:45 p.m. today. Police rained batons and arrested 15 other agitators. A person injured by tear gas shells was admitted at Bir Hospital, said a volunteer. All those arrested were released later in the evening.
Meanwhile, Tibetan refugees held a peace rally in Pokhara on Monday protesting the killing and suppression of Tibetan protesters  in Lhasa. The protesters  gathered in front of the regional office of UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) and walked past different parts of the city, urging the UN to help restore human rights in Tibet.
OHCHR concerned over use of force
UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) expressed concern over excessive use of force by police against demonstrators in Lalitpur [i.e. the protest described in para 1 above]. 
""I urge the government to respect its obligations under international human rights law and to uphold the fundamental rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,"" the statement quoted Richard Bennett, representative of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as saying.
The statement also clarified that UN had never asked police to intervene in the rally. ""At no time have police been requested by the UN to intervene in peaceful protests in front of UN House,"" the statement quoted UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Piper as saying.
Chinese embassy denies suppression
Chinese embassy in Kathmandu on Monday said ""the so-called suppression"" against Tibetan protesters  was ""baseless"". ""In order to protect social stability and safeguard the personal safety and property of people in Tibet, the concerned department of the government of TAR [Tibet Autonomous Region] legally took effective measures to handle this riot,"" said the embassy statement.
The embassy also charged that the protest was ""organized"", ""premeditated"" and ""well planned"" by the ""Dalai clique"" with the intention of instigating discord at a sensitive period before the Beijing Olympics.

"5744",20072983,"Title: Democracy day' marks Nepal anniversary.rtf; Date: April 24, 2007 Tuesday 8:06 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's new government celebrated Tuesday the first anniversary of the end of absolute rule by the king as officials and analysts hailed huge progress but warned of a tough road to democracy.
The Himalayan nation's Maoist rebels ended a decade-long insurgency and joined a new interim government under a peace deal with mainstream parties after violent street protests forced King Gyanendra to restore parliament.
""On this day (April 24, 2006), Nepali people successfully fought for their rights,"" Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said at a flag-draped parade ground ceremony marking ""Democracy Day."" 
""This day has given us the responsibility to build a peaceful, prosperous and a new Nepal by ending all sorts of problems and conflicts,"" Koirala said.
The ceremony saw an army band play lively martial music as school children marched past carrying banners. A helicopter also showered flower petals onto politicians and diplomats attending the event.
""It's a long way for a country to come after ten years of bitter armed conflict,"" said Ian Martin, the head of the United Nations mission in Nepal.
""The Maoists have come from the countryside into the political process, the Maoist army has placed its weapons under storage and UN monitoring, and we now have the interim parliament and government that the Maoists have entered.""
The Nepalese army -- once fiercely loyal to the monarch -- played a central role in the celebrations, in what observers said was a clear effort to dispel any talk about cracks in the peace process.
King Gyanendra seized power by claiming the elected government had failed to quash the Maoist rebellion and that the country was headed for anarchy.
But his heavy-handed crackdown on free speech -- including mass arrests of protesters and tight media controls -- quickly led to a surge in anti-royal sentiment.
At least 19 people died and 5,000 were injured in last year's protests, which forced the king to relinquish direct rule and led eventually to the peace deal.
But a range of issues threaten to make the road ahead for the peace deal a rocky one.
These include arguments over the date of constituent assembly polls needed to elect a body to rewrite the constitution and decide on what, if any, future there is for the king.
""The future looks bright and promising but greater challenges lie ahead,"" said Kapil Shrestha, who teaches political science at Tribhuvan University.
The Maoists are impatient for the country to be declared a republic and have threatened to step up their campaign if the polls are not held on time in June, as specified by the peace deal.
Nepal's election chief, however, has said he needs more time.
The Maoists, who still feature on Washington's list of foreign ""terrorist"" organisations, are also facing continued allegations of mafia-like conduct including extortion, kidnappings and beatings.
Officials are also wrestling with the fallout from brutal clashes between Maoists and Mahadhesis -- a major ethnic group in the southern plains -- with the Maoists accusing the sidelined king of provoking the violence.
""If the government miscalculates with the Mahadhesi movement and fails to address the issues in a timely fashion, there is the potential for a separatist movement,"" said C.K. Lal, a columnist with the Nepali Times weekly.
The Mahadhesis, who make up about half of Nepal's 27 million population, have long complained about being under-represented in government and resent the Maoists' new role.
The king is viewed by loyalists as a Hindu deity but has now been stripped of his title of head of state and is no longer head of the army.
""The king has been the biggest loser and he has nobody to blame but himself. He gambled the institution of monarchy for his own benefit,"" said Shrestha.

"7097",2008413,"Title: Maoists are anti-Hindu_ Yogi.rtf; Date: April 26, 2008 Saturday 4:26 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI (India), April 26 -- LEADERS OF the World Hindu Federation International (WHFI) on Saturday gave a call for restoration of monarchy in Nepal. The leaders said the Hindu organisations active in India and Nepal would join hands to launch a movement under the leadership of King Gyanendra to safeguard the rights of the king in the emerging political scenario in Nepal.
  Inaugurating the general council meeting of the World Hindu Federation International (WHFI), BJP MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath said Maoists managed to capture power on the barrel of the gun.
  Terming the Maoists as anti-Hindu and anti-monarchy, Yogi said the new government in Nepal under the leadership of the Maoists would be a major threat to the security of India.
  ""China will now try to make inroads into Nepal and strengthen its base. Maoists have a close relationship with the Naxal organisations and will provoke them to capture political power in India,"" he said.
  India and Nepal shared a close cultural affinity since ages but Maoist leaders were hell bent on breaking the relationship to serve their political interests, he added.
  He said the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had committed a blunder on Nepal and likened it to ""one by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru with regard to Tibet"". He said anti-India and anti-Hindu rule in Nepal should be overthrown immediately. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) international president Ashok Singhal said the interim government had declared Nepal a secular country. ""It was a conspiracy to destroy Hinduism in Nepal. Maoists plan to repeat what China has done in Tibet. For the greater interest of India as well as the Hindu community, Nepal should continue as a Hindu kingdom,"" he said.
  ""We will have to take to the streets and even lay down our lives to safeguard the rights of the king. The Hindu leaders should form a Hindu Morcha to continue the agitation. If the king remains in power, the rights of the Hindus would be automatically safeguarded,"" he said.
  Former Union Minister Subramaniam Swamy said, ""Wwe are concerned as the Hindu community is the target and the Maoists have decided to end monarchy. Maoists have a close relationship with Naxalites, Ulfa, LTTE and PWG. Jagat Guru Ramananad Haricharyaji, Mahant Surendranath and other Hindu religious leaders tooo condemned the Maoists and called for restoration of monarchy in Nepal.

"962",20031594,"Title: China releases eight out of 18 Tibetans deported from Nepal.rtf; Date: July 26, 2003 Saturday; Text: China has released eight out of a group of 18 Tibetan would-be refugees who have been detained since being repatriated from Nepal in May, Radio Free Asia (RFA) said Saturday.
The remaining 10 asylum seekers will be released soon, the radio said in a statement, quoting anonymous sources.
The release took place earlier than expected, as Chinese officials had previously said most of the group would be held for three months at the Shigatse Detention Center in Tibet, according to the report.
""The 10 who are still in the Shigatse Detention Center had no relatives who could pay to get them out, so they're still in there,"" one source told RFA's Tibetan service.
Only one of the Tibetans, accused of guiding this and other groups in attempted escapes, is expected to be given a jail sentence, the radio said.
The 18 Tibetans, eight aged under 16, entered Nepal in April hoping to reach the north Indian base of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.
They were arrested for entering the country without valid travel documents and held until they were handed over to Chinese embassy officials in late May, despite appeals by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Both the United States and the European Union condemned the deportation as a violation of international practices dictating the humane treatment of asylum seekers.
As many as 35,000 Tibetan refugees have settled in Nepal, but the kingdom is careful not to anger Beijing and has refused to let the Dalai Lama visit.
The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize three decades later for his non-violent opposition to Beijing's presence in Tibet.

Text of report by Indian news agency PTI
Kathmandu, 19 April: Nepal is set to beef up security along the Indian border to check the movement of criminals and clampdown on smuggling in the porous region. 
""Necessary preparations are already underway and Armed Police Force (APF) personnel for the posts have already been sought,"" APF's Deputy Inspector General Thakur Mohan Shrestha said at Pakali in Sunsari district Wednesday [19 April]. 
He said security units of APF are to be deployed along the Nepal-India border of five eastern districts within the second week of June in order to curb criminal activities and to maintain security. 
The decision to beef up security along the international border comes as Nepal's top watchdog, the Commission of Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), has directed the authorities to clampdown on smuggling of red sandalwood from India to China via Nepal. 
Nearly seven tonnes of red sandalwood valued at Rs 2 crore was seized at Shimle in Nepal's Sindupalchowk district while being smuggled to China via Tatopani border. 
A week back, the police had seized 11 tonnes of red sandalwood from Naubise in Kathmandu.
Shrestha said a separate border security team of 235 APF personnel under the command of a Superintendent of Police would be deployed for the purpose.  He was quoted as saying by the Kantipur Online that the government had selected locations at Chandragadhi-2 of Jhapa, Budhanagar-1 of Morang, Inaruwa-6 of Sunsari, Kocharbarbari-7 of Saptari and Sanhaitha-1 of Siraha district to establish the posts on the international border.

 The parties called for the dawn-to-dusk one-day closure of the Kathmandu Valley to protest 'police intervention' in their anti-king rallies Friday.
The strike, which reportedly caught most of the valley dwellers unaware, disrupted public transportation across the cities.
 As vehicles were mostly off the streets, hapless foreign visitors were seen riding tricycle rickshaws to catch international flights at Kathmandu airport. Some tourists were also seen hitching a ride on power tillers to reach their destinations.
 Leaders and activists of the political parties marched through the streets of the cities shouting anti-king slogans to mark their third day of protests.
 Police said party workers burnt tires to create roadblocks and smashed and vandalized cars and motorcycles plying the roads in defiance of the strike.
 Clashes between the protesters and police as well as injuries were reported in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur.
 Nepalese mainstream political parties are agitating over the 2002 dismissal of the elected government and replacement with one loyal to the monarchy.
 In October 2002, King Gyanendra fired then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and assumed executive powers when the latter asked for the postponement of a planned parliamentary election.
 The parties are demanding that the king return the power to appoint prime ministers to the parliament, which remains dissolved.
 Meanwhile, Maoist rebels fighting to abolish the monarchy have extended support to the parties' anti-king agitation.
 Top rebel leader Prachanda, who goes by one name, in a statement Friday said the time has come to wage a united struggle against feudal forces in the country.

"3871",20053174,"Title: Nepal schools obey Maoist shutdown order after rebel bombs.rtf; Date: April 15, 2005 Friday 10:41 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's private schools outside the capital, Kathmandu, obeyed Friday a Maoist rebel order to shut after guerrilla bombs,  planted as warnings, exploded in three empty schools, officials said.
Two of the blasts occurred Thursday while the other took place last week, Nepal's private schools' association said. All of the bombs exploded in rebel-dominated west Nepal, damaging the buildings but causing no injuries.
Schools outside Kathmandu, where the Maoists hold sway, heeded the rebel closure order that marked the latest challenge to the authority of King Gyanendra who seized power February 1.
But educational institutions in the tightly guarded capital, Kathmandu, functioned normally after re-opening for the new academic year in the country of 27 million people.
""The Maoists bombed two schools in western Nepal Thursday and another there last week to warn them of the consequences if they ignored the closure order,"" said Bhim Pant, a senior member of Nepal's private schools' association.
The Private and Boarding School Organization-Nepal said the Maoist student wing had been bombarding schools with threatening e-mails and telephone calls  telling them to close unless they met a series of demands.
""No students or teachers were injured in the bombings but the school buildings were damaged,"" said Pant. ""Maoist student leaders have been constantly threatening the schools by telephone and e-mails to close down all private boarding schools or face dire consequences.""
The Maoists want the institutions to cut fees, scrap singing the national anthem and remove photographs of Gyanendra as part of a drive to install their own ""people's education"" system.
But the schools have refused to obey the Maoists.
The schools confrontation follows an end Wednesday to an 11-day Maoist road blockade and general strike to protest the king's power grab that was observed in rural areas but had little impact in Kathmandu where security is tight.
The king dismissed the government and imposed emergency rule in what he said was a move to tackle the increasingly deadly revolt by the Maoists who are battling to set up a communist republic in the desperately poor country.
The Maoists also want the children of top government officials excluded from private schools and forced into state schools, and an end to the teaching of Sanskrit, the priestly language the rebels link to Hinduism's high castes.
Many parents seek to send their offspring to private schools as state schools are overcrowded and offer only a basic education.
Some 1.5 million students study in Nepal's 8,500 private and boarding schools. The 4.9 million students studying in Nepal's 25,000 public schools were not affected by the Maoists' closure demand.
In Rupandehi district, 300 kilometres (187 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, 172 private boarding schools shut, disrupting the studies of 72,000 students because of constant threats of attacks on schools and teachers,"" Prem Shah, another schools' association official, said.
A senior education ministry official said the government strongly opposed the rebel threats and ""have asked all the schools in the country not to yield but to continue as usual.""

"7128",2008948,"Title: Nepalese ex-Gurkhas protest over Maoists' plan to stop foreign recruitment.rtf; Date: December 25, 2008 Thursday 11:36 AM GMT; Text: Around 200 ex-Gurkha soldiers and their families rallied in the Nepalese capital in protest against the Maoist's government's plan to stop the recruitment of Gurkha soldiers into the British and Indian armies, eyewitnesses said.
Protesters carrying placards that read ""Gurkha recruitment must continue"" and ""Gurkha recruitment not shameful, it is an honour,"" marched through the streets Thursday afternoon demanding the government revokes its policy on stopping foreign recruitment, an AFP reporter at the scene said.
The Maoists, elected earlier this year to rule the Himalayan nation after fighting a decade-long armed struggle, have threatened to end what they see as the humiliating recruitment of young Nepali men into the British and Indian armed forces.
The ultra leftists say prospective Gurkha fighters will be given opportunities at home.
""We are protesting against the Maoists to pressurise them to immediately scrap their plans to stop recruitment of Gurkha soldiers in foreign countries,"" Dhan Bahadur Maskey Rana, a former Gurkha soldier who served in the Indian Army, told AFP at the rally.
""There are no employment opportunities here (in Nepal) and the Maoists are trying to snatch away our source of employment,"" said Rana.
""I don't know why Maoists are after recruitment of Gurkha soldiers when hundreds of youth go for jobs abroad,"" said Leela Rana, another protester.
""It's a prestigious job and has made the country proud,"" she said.
Famed for their loyalty, discipline and courage in battle, Nepali Gurkhas have been recruited into the British and Indian army for centuries.
The British Army currently has around 3,400 Gurkhas serving in countries including Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Indian Army also has some 40,000 in its ranks.
Tens of thousands of family members depend entirely on Gurkha salaries and pensions, providing income that would otherwise be unobtainable in the largely agricultural, impoverished country.

""At least 20 Maoists were killed in an exchange of fire between the army security and Maoist rebels at Sodasa locality in Achham district 390 kilometres (242 miles) west of Kathmandu,"" said an army official who did not want to be named.
Another seven guerrillas were killed by the army in the southwestern Dang district.
Four rebels were killed in the western Salyan district and four in Wadula in the eastern Khotang district, the officials added.
Meanwhile, a police source said two policemen were killed and one seriously injured during a rebel attack in Duhabi in Sunsari district, 290 kilometres (181 miles) far southeast of Kathmandu.
The rebels killed in Achham and Dang district are believed to be part of the group that attacked a police training camp on Sunday night in Bhaluwang village in Dang, which left 25 rebels and 16 police dead.
Elsewhere, rebels torched a four-wheel drive vehicle owned by Madhav Kumar Nepal, leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist-Leninist, the radio said.
A bomb went off inside the Agriculture Development Office, in Nuwakot district, northwest of Kathmandu, causing damage to the office building, said the Nepali-language evening daily Sandhyakalin. No one was injured.
The rebels also set fire to the house of National Democratic Party central member Pratibha Rana in midwestern Nepal's Bardiya District on Wednesday morning, the newspaper said.
But the Maoists did release the chairman of a left-wing student union after hundreds of students protested against his abduction, student sources said Wednesday.
Hundreds of students protested in Kathmandu Monday demanding that the rebels free All Nepal National Free Students' Union (ANNFSU) chairman Rajendra Kumar Rai, whom they had kidnapped on Friday.
ANNFSU is affiliated to the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) political party.
The Maoists have not said why they abducted Rai, but they have in the past kidnapped people connected with rival parties.
Violence has surged in Nepal since an eight-day ceasefire, called by the rebels called to mark the Hindu kingdom's most important festival Dasain, ended a week ago on October 9.
Since the end of the temporary truce 176 people have been reported killed, dashing hopes that the peaceful holiday would restart efforts to find a political solution to the seven-and-a-half-year insurrection.
The Maoists held three rounds of peace talks with the government this year but walked out of negotiations after Kathmandu refused rebel demands to call a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 8,200 lives, according to government figures.

"6947",20083031,"Title: Nepal 's ex-king has hundreds of millions stashed away_ author.rtf; Date: June 10, 2008 Tuesday 4:46 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's ousted king is thought to have close to 200 million dollars stashed away inside the country and even more abroad, according to an author who has probed royal finances.
Surya Thapa, a journalist who has written three books on the Himalayan royals, said ex-king Gyanendra is unlikely to feel any financial squeeze as a commoner, and that state accountants will have a tough time if they want to confiscate his wealth.
""According to my research, he has around 195 million dollars invested in around 35 companies in Nepal and may have transferred more abroad,"" said Thapa.
""Nobody knows how much money he has outside Nepal and there is no way anyone can find out,"" he said.
The author said Nepal's rulers have a history of putting their cash abroad and doing their best to conceal it.
Up to nearly three decades ago, ""the royal family was very visibly investing in land, property, companies and industry,"" said Thapa. But a referendum in 1980 giving the royals a slim vote of approval made them fear for their future.
""The vote alarmed them so they started investing very silently"" through third parties such as loyal supporters, he told AFP.
""Gyanendra has been good at concealing his investments,"" said Thapa, who did his research by tracking land registration documents linked to the royals and interviewed scores of royal business associates, pro-royal politicians and palace workers.
His comments came as a government official said that Gyanendra was also refusing to cooperate with a committee set up to audit royal property and that his diamond and ruby-adorned crown had yet to be recovered.
Nepal's monarchy was abolished on May 28 by a constitutional assembly set up following a peace deal with Maoist insurgents and mainstream parties.
Gyanendra has been given until Thursday to vacate the palace, and his royal purse -- along with allowances to 15 other royals -- has been stopped.
Nepal's new republican government, which includes hardened Maoists who fought for a decade to sack the king, has not ruled out further investigating Gyanendra's personal fortune.
""We haven't decided what we want to do regarding Gyanendra's personal finances. We might investigate later,"" peace minister Ram Chandra Poudel said.
The palace secretariat declined to make any comment when asked about the king's wealth.
But even before he was vaulted to the throne in 2001 following a palace massacre, Gyanendra was a high-profile businessman -- with reported interests in hotels, biscuits, cigarettes, garments and tea.
After his coronation, he is believed to have transferred most of his assets to his daughter and wife, Thapa said.
Although many treasures will stay in the palace, the royals ""have a good personal collection of gold and precious stones they'll take with them,"" said the author.

 Baglung, west Nepal , 14 April: A food crisis has emerged in the remote areas of Baglung and Myagdi districts.
 Locals from Galkot and Bartung in Baglung and north and west of Myagdi said it has become difficult to eke out a living after the food crisis.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 15 Apr 04, p 5
The crisis surfaced after restrictions on the movement of food grains from district headquarters to villages; government has also not made any effort to dispatch food grains to villages.
 Grains are not available in the remote districts of Baglung for two years after Maoists destroyed two food depots built to supply food grains to the remote areas of the district. Plans for the reconstruction of the depots have been shelved for fear Maoists will loot the grains.  passage omitted
 The food crisis has surfaced in rural areas in the absence of alternatives to purchase unlimited quantities of food grains for transport to villages; security has been enforced in the Dhaulagiri region after the month-long Maoist economic blockade and the attack on Myagdi district headquarters 27 March .  passage omitted

Amid a function, Sarat Singh Bhandari, Lekharaj Bhatta, Gopal Kirati, Anil Jha, Brijesh Kumar Gupta and Hem Raj Tated have taken the oath of office and secrecy for the Defence, Commerce, Culture, Industry, Law and Environment ministries respectively in the presence of President Dr Ram Baran Yadav in the presidential building in Sheetal Niwas.
In the present cabinet, Maoist leaders Bhatta and Kirati were cabinet colleague of UCPN-Maoist chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal in his government in 2008. They also belong to the chairman's faction in the party. However, the Mohan Baidhya faction has not been included as it has been expressing reservation over the party's decisions on the ex-Maoist fighters' arsenal key handover, release the property seized during the ten-year insurgency to the rightful owners and disband the para-military structure of  Young Communist League, Maoist youth wing.
While leaders of United Madhesi Democratic Front (UDMF)-Bhandari and Tated belong to Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, Jha is the chairman of the newly formed Federal Sadbhawana Party, the breakaway faction from the Sadbhawana Party-led by Rajendra Mahato, and Gupta represents Terai Madhesh Loktantrik Party.
Maoist vice chairman Bhattarai won the PM election after inking a four point deal between the Maoist and the United Madhesi Democratic Front, the joint front of Madhesh based parties in the Legislature-Parliament on August 28.
Initially, Dr Bhattarai appointed Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, chairman of Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, the largest party of UDMF, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs on August 29 and in the second round of expansion 13 more ministers were inducted on September 4.

"7016",20082856,"Title: Nepal 's Maoist rebels face critical democratic test.rtf; Date: April 10, 2008 Thursday 2:52 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's Maoists may have succeeded in fighting their way out of the jungles and mountains and into the capital, but on Thursday they are facing what analysts say is their biggest test yet.
The impoverished Himalayan country is voting on its political future, and also delivering a verdict on whether the rebels can be trusted to lead Nepal into a new era of stability after a decade of civil war that they started.
Although the ultra-leftists renounced violence when they signed a peace deal in 2006, the run-up to the polls has seen them accused of bullying voters and threatening to go back to war should they feel cheated once ballots are counted.
Analysts say it all points to an organisation that is at best struggling to adapt to the democratic process, or at worst exploiting it after having failed to score an outright win in a ""people's war"" that left at least 13,000 dead.
""Guns and muscle power continue to dominate their policies,"" said Yubaraj Ghimire, the editor of weekly news magazine Newsfront and a sceptic when it comes to assessing the Maoists' democratic credentials.
""They want to be part of mainstream politics, but they want it on their own terms,"" he said, pointing to frequent points during the peace process when the rebels pushed to the brink of collapse and won even more concessions from mainstream parties.
The rebels have certainly come a long way: in 1996, they launched their campaign to topple the monarchy with a few dozen fighters and home made weapons, and progressively fought the Royal Nepal Army to a stalemate.
In caste-riven and impoverished rural Nepal, the rebels also found fertile ground for their ""Prachanda Path"" version of communism, named after the rebel leader whose nom-de-guerre means ""the fierce one.""
A big boost came in bizarre circumstances in 2001, when the then king and almost all the royal family were massacred by a binge drinking, drugged, lovelorn and suicidal prince with a unhealthy passion for guns.
The new king, Gyanendra, and his son Paras -- loathed for his apparent playboy lifestyle -- failed to win the hearts and minds of a public that viewed their survival of the palace massacre as deeply suspicious.
When Gyanendra tried to seize absolute power to fight the Maoists it only hastened his own ongoing demise and paved the way for the peace deal and Thursday's elections.
Nearly all the main parties contesting the polls agree the king and crown prince must be sacked after the elections, so the Maoists have, in effect, nearly achieved what they want to do: rid the country of royals.
Some analysts also contend that the rebels are trying to adapt, and ongoing violent conduct is only to be expected given they spent 10 years fighting a war marked by brutality on both sides.
""If they were not committed to the peace process and election, they would have already gone back to the jungles or split into factions,"" said Bhasker Gautam, an author and political analyst.
""For a party with such a bloody history, it's quite impressive. They have been tested time and time again, and have solved issues through negotiation.""
The editor of the English language Nepali Times, Kunda Dixit, paints a more complex picture -- that of a rebel force still at war with itself, caught in a tug-of-war of uncompromising revolutionary ideology on one side and realpolitik on the other.
""There are two schools of thought about the Maoists. The first is that a Maoist will always be a Maoist, and that they will use parliamentary politics to seize power,"" Dixit said.
""The other is that they will come around and adjust to multi party democracy. Within the party, both schools of thought still exist.""
Thursday's vote will therefore be a test for those hardliners in the Maoists who are wedded to an all-or-nothing lexicon, and especially for the moderates committed to giving peace a chance should the party fare badly.
""At the moment, Prachanda has been able to keep a lid on things,"" Dixit said. ""Whether that will hold if they lose badly will be the challenge.""

"6580",20084006,"Title: Tears, prayers as Bhutan 's Tibetan refugees watch helplessly.rtf; Date: March 20, 2008 Thursday 1:49 AM GMT; Text: Tibetan refugees living in Bhutan say they are watching the upheaval in their Himalayan homeland nervously but are fearful of speaking out.
Many Tibetans who fled from the vast Himalayan region to Bhutan in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule have become Bhutanese citizens and have little contact with their community.
But a few hundred Tibetans continue to live in small refugee camps across the small Himalayan nation and are yet to get citizenship.
""We have been watching the situation in Tibet on television. We feel very sad, but we are helpless here,"" said a 30-something Tibetan shop owner who declined to be named as she was not a Bhutanese citizen.
Tibet has seen protests and rioting over the past week, and the region has been subjected to a tough security clampdown.
China said rioters killed 13 ""innocent civilians"" in Tibet's capital Lhasa on Friday. Tibet's prime minister-in-exile said on Monday that about 100 people had been killed in China's crackdown on the protesters.
""I have just been praying. I can't talk about Tibet anymore,"" the woman said on Wednesday, as she wept with a string of prayer beads in her hand.
As refugees, Tibetans cannot apply for government jobs or a licence to run shops. But many have been running handicrafts shops in the national capital Thimphu by getting licences under someone else's name.
""I came here in 1959 when I was eight with my grandmother and parents. We would trek during nights,"" said 57-year-old shop owner Dawa, who became a citizen after marrying a Bhutanese.
""I watched the news and cried a lot yesterday. We have been praying for Tibetans and lighting lamps.""
""We feel very strongly about Tibet and what is happening now, but what can we do,"" said another shop owner whose parents fled after the uprising, but who was born in Bhutan.
""I speak the Tibetan language at home and follow my culture,"" she said, lowering her voice in a tiny shop as foreign tourists browsed for knick-knacks and antique handicrafts.
With Bhutan's first parliamentary elections due next week in a move away from absolute monarchy, most Bhutanese remained indifferent to the Tibetan cause.
""The Bhutanese are much closer to India than to Tibet, which is seen as a part of China. And we have little contact with China,"" said Tashi Dorji, editor of weekly newspaper Bhutan Observer.
""Bhutan is very remote and has had little interaction with Tibet. But the Dalai Lama is greatly revered here,"" said Kinley Dorji, managing director of national Keunsel newspaper.
After the Chinese crackdown in 1959, many Tibetans fled to neighbouring India -- where they have set up a government-in-exile under the leadership of the Dali Lama -- and to Nepal. Fewer Tibetans crossed the border with Bhutan because of a rough terrain.

"4549",20061881,"Title: More than 150,000 defy curfew and protest on Katmandu 's outskirts.rtf; Date: April 21, 2006 Friday 11:31 AM GMT; Text: A massive crowd of protesters rallied on the outskirts of the Nepalese capital on Friday, defying a government-imposed curfew a day after security forces opened fire on demonstrators in a deadly display of force.
As the tension built at a stand-off between demonstrators and hundreds of security forces on Katmandu's outskirts, state radio announced that King Gyanendra would address the nation Friday.
Diplomats had been predicting the king would make an important announcement, trying to end the crisis engulfing his country. The U.S. ambassador warned that the unrest would force Gyandra from power if he didn't do something soon.
Three separate groups of marchers each in numbering in the thousands converged on an area on the western edge of Katmandu called Kalanki, where police shot three demonstrators dead on Thursday and wounded dozens more.
An Associated Press reporter at the scene estimated the crowd at more than 100,000; independent Kantipur television said it counted some 150,000.
They faced off against hundreds of security forces that have ringed the city issued with shoot-to-kill orders against anyone who tries to enter the curfew zone.
As the tension grew, so did the international pressure on Gyanendra.
U.S. Ambassador James Moriarty bluntly warned that Gyanendra could be forced from power within days unless he makes some concessions to those who want him to relinquish the absolute power he seized 14 months ago.
""His time is running out,"" Moriarty said in an interview with several reporters. ""Ultimately the king will have to leave if he doesn't compromise. And by 'ultimately' I mean sooner rather than later.""
Earlier, an Indian envoy who met with Gyanendra on Thursday said he expected a ""major announcement"" that could defuse the situation.
""It is our hope and expectation that perhaps by the end of the day some major announcement will be made,"" Karan Singh told reporters in New Delhi after returning from Nepal. ""We are hoping that there will be some major step toward reinstating democracy.""
State radio said Gyanendra's address would be broadcast at 7 p.m. (1315 GMT). It gave no other details.
There was minor unrest at Friday's demonstrations.
A group of protesters destroyed a tin shack covered with barbed wire that was serving as a temporary police checkpoint. Another group vandalized a government office, throwing out portraits of King Gyanendra before setting the building on fire.
Meanwhile, the death toll from two weeks of often violent demonstrations against Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power 14 months ago rose to 14 on Friday after a protester shot by police on Thursday died.
At Kalanki, protesters claimed the area with a message scrawled in large red and white letters on the pavement, ""Martyrs' square, long live the martyrs.""
They waved the flags of opposition political parties and chanted, ""Long live democracy! The blood of the martyrs will not go to waste!""
Nepal's crisis has escalated steadily since a general strike began two weeks ago and protesters hit the streets daily, leaving the Himalayan country paralyzed and at its most volatile since the king seized power.
Government notices issued early Friday said the 9 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew must be observed in Katmandu, its suburbs of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and in the resort town of Pokhara, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the capital.
The notices warned people to stay indoors during the curfew and said those who violate it will be shot.
They said the curfew was imposed ""to protect the people, property and peace.""
The protester who died at a hospital Friday was among 26 people shot at Gulariya, 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Katmandu, during Thursday's protests.
A Defense Ministry statement said security forces had to fire on Thursday because the situation was getting out of control.
It said 13 policemen were wounded in clashes with protesters who vandalized government offices and tried but failed to set them on fire.
At the Model Hospital, where many of the wounded protesters including three of those killed were taken, doctors wore black bands to protest the shootings.
Among the 66 wounded people brought there on Thursday were a 10-year-old boy with a gunshot wound and 5-year-old beaten by police, said Dr. Sarita Pandey.
On Friday, about 100,000 people walked from surrounding villages to march peacefully along the main road that circles Katmandu, littered with bricks and burning tires.
Katmandu residents rushed to markets for food and other supplies before the curfew began. Shortages of fresh food and cooking fuel continued due to the general strike.
Notices posted around the city asked government workers to report to work before the curfew began.
Associated Press writer Matthew Rosenberg contributed to this report.

Prime Minister Thapa's resignation is expected to pave the way for political parties to meet the king for dialogue to the end the political crisis. The five parties have been demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Thapa terming Thapa's government as unconstitutional.
 Prime Minister Thapa said, ""In order to pave the way for national consensus for the protection of constitutional monarchy, multi-party democracy and in the greater interests of the national interest, I have decided to hand in my resignation letter to His Majesty the King today.""
 In his 10-minute-long address, Prime Minister Thapa said despite his efforts to involve the political parties, he was unable to do so.
 ""In order to seek cooperation, I had maintained a very small cabinet size as well as made personally all possible efforts to secure dialogue, support and cooperation. But because of the stand taken by the agitating political parties no progress could be made. Instead the difference and conflict escalated,"" Thapa said.
 Thapa said King Gyanendra remains very concerned and sensitive over the situation and remains committed to handover the governance to an elected government.
 Thapa said his belief in multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy still remains unshaken and elections must be held in order to protect the constitution and democracy. But he added national consensus in necessary for this.
 Thapa was appointed as a prime minister by the King on 4 June 2003 following the resignation from the then prime minister, Lokendra Bahadur Chand.

 The ""sadhu"", one Satya Mazumdar took his 14-month old daughter to the main shrine of the temple and was about to slit her throat when the priests raised an alarm and got him arrested on Friday 13 June .
 The incident created sensation in the temple which was thronged by devotees from across the country and abroad for the annual ""Ambubasi"" festival scheduled on 22 June.  Ambubasi Mela (fair) is a four-day festival held every year. This mela is associated with the legend of menstrual cycle of the Goddess Kamakhya. During Ambubasi the temple remains closed for three days and on the fourth day only devotees are allowed for worship inside the temple.
PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 0914 gmt 14 Jun 03
Irate youths roughed up the person before police came to the spot and arrested him.
 Temple administrator Riju Sarma told PTI that the man, residing in the temple along with other devotees for the past couple of days, was behaving in an ""abnormal"" fashion. ""He suddenly seized the child, Tara Devi, and was about to slit her throat with a razor…  ellipsis as received Luckily he was spotted and the gruesome crime averted.""
 The child who suffered minor injury in the neck was admitted to the Guwahati Medical college hospital, in this eastern Indian city, and was on Saturday reported to be out of danger.

 Sarma said before his arrest Mazumdar was heard shouting that he had done the deed to have ""more power from Ma Kamakhya"".
 ""Please have mercy on me. She (the child) is my daughter and I did not want to commit any sin. I wanted to offer her to the goddess for the welfare of the people,"" he pleaded as he was whisked away to Jalukbari police station.

The report proposes seven federal units including two provinces in the Tarai region and five including Kathmandu Valley Province. Member of the panel Narahari Acharya presented the report along with a map of the federal units.
Stating that the 14 federal units proposed by the state restructuring committee of the Constituent Assembly was imaginary and fabricated, Acharya said that only four states out of them could be sustainable while the other 10 could not.
The panel identified two issues - identity and resources - of the proposed units as major bases for carving out units. Identity indicates caste, community, language, culture, territory/region and historical continuity while resource indicates economic viability, situation of infrastructure development, availability of natural resources and administrative accessibility, according to Acharya.
He told the CWC formation of state restructuring commission was a constitutional compulsion and a practical necessity. ""As different parties are claiming different things about the issue of restructuring, a commission or a team of experts must work out the issue,"" he said.
Vice President Paudel and Central Working Committee (CWC) members Minendra Rijal, Ram Kumar Chaudhari and Chandra Bhandari spoke on the issue at today's CWC meeting.
Bhandari stressed that development model should be made the main base while deciding on state restructuring.
""UN general secretary Ban Ki-moon, while being elected, had said that there were only 75 nations in 1945 and the number has reached 200 now and it might increase to 300 if concrete attempts to stop it were not made. Lately, Sudan has split. This reference shows that if the issue of caste, community, culture and other identities were made the bases in state structure, it would divide a nation. This should be considered seriously while deciding on state structure here in Nepal,"" Bhandari said.
The discussion will resume tomorrow afternoon.
Meanwhile, NC today formed a three-member committee to resolve problems that had surfaced in different casinos.
The panel comprising Nabindra Raj Joshi, Dhanraj Gurung and Shankar Bhandari, in coordination with Trade Union Congress-Independent, will present a report recommending suggestions to resolve the problems, said a statement issued by the party.

government form a probe panel and take action against the culprit.

The disabled lot here bemoan that ID cards issued to them have become virtually dysfunctional. They allege that they are forced to pay full fare while travelling in public vehicles. Sometimes, they have to get off the bus half way if they do not pay the full fare.
Kimasar Khatri of Dadakhali-9 laments abled people and males capture the seats reserved for the disabled and females in public vehicles leaving women and the physically-challenged to stand.
These people are also harassed. ""If we ask for discount, the vehicle staff scold us,"" Khatri said.
Similar is the plight of Dhansara Shahi (22) of Mehelkuna-8. Shahi says it took her two years to get the disable-ID card. To her utter dismay, the ID card is almost useless. ""Instead of concession, I am humiliated in public vehicles,"" Shahi shared.

Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, whom British police identified as the main suspect in the March 2003 rape and murder of Hannah Foster in Southampton, England, was arrested on Thursday in India's West Bengal state.
Kohli was identified by residents of a tea-growing village bordering Nepal two days after Foster's parents held a news conference in New Delhi announcing a reward for information leading to his arrest. Villagers recognized his picture from a newspaper report.
Police said he was trying to flee to Nepal. Kohli denied that he killed Foster.
Police officer Rajiv Mishra said the court asked police to hand Kohli over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, India's FBI. It will turn Kohli over to Interpol after completing extradition formalities, he said.
""A CBI team will come to take Kohli in two to three days,"" he said.
Kohli reportedly fled from Britain after British police found Foster's body and identified him as the suspect.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 24 February
Kathmandu, 24 February: Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has claimed that the government will reach an agreement with the agitating Madhesi [southern plains or Terai] parties by this evening, CPN-Maoist [Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist] chairman Prachanda informed.
Quoting the prime minister, Prachanda added an understanding has almost been reached on the demands put forth by the Madhesi parties.
Prachanda informed about Prime Minister Koirala's remarks, addressing media persons at the TU [Tribhuvan University] Teaching Hospital at Maharajgunj in the capital this afternoon. He had gone to the hospital after meeting the prime minister to pay condolences to Maoist leader Rajendra Banjade, killed in Argakhanchi District.
The Maoist chairman expressed his hope that the election preparations will move ahead after reaching an understanding on the demands put forth by the agitating Madhesi parties.
Prime Minister Koirala and Prachanda had discussed mainly on the Terai agitation, during an hour-long meeting at the PM's official residence at Baluwatar in the capital.
The prime minister's remark comes at a time when the major agitating Madhes-based party United Democratic Madhesi Front (UDMF) announced to refrain from submitting closed list under proportional electoral system for the constituent assembly election even on the extended deadline, today, stating the government had failed to address all of their demands.
A meeting of the Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) on Saturday had declined fulfilling UDMF's demand calling for an autonomous Madhes state, adding only elected constituent assembly can take such decision.

"6988",20083988,"Title: Tibet govt-in-exile says 30 dead in unrest, Chinese security tight.rtf; Date: March 15, 2008 Saturday 8:12 PM GMT; Text: Tibet's exiled government said Saturday that about 30 people had been killed during unrest in Lhasa, as Chinese troops locked down the city amid fierce international scrutiny ahead of the Olympics.
Witnesses said tanks and soldiers were out in force in Lhasa following Friday's protests, the biggest against China's controversial rule of Tibet since 1989, as authorities set a Monday deadline for perpetrators to surrender.
""We are confirming approximately 30 deaths, and we are even hearing numbers of over 100 dead, but this number we are unable to confirm,"" Tenzin Taklha, a senior official of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala in northern India, told AFP.
""Right now we are hearing that there are many Chinese troops in Lhasa. There are pockets of people out in the streets right now, but there is great fear among the population.""
The state-run Xinhua news agency earlier said 10 people died in the unrest, citing government officials from Tibet who blamed ""mobs"" for the violence.
""The victims are all innocent civilians, and they have been burnt to death,"" Xinhua said, adding that no foreigners had been killed.
While authorities appeared in control in Lhasa Saturday, monks led a second day of rallies in Xiahe, Gansu province, the site of one of Tibetan Buddhism's most important monasteries, two activist groups and a local resident said.
China's top official in Tibet, a vast region formally annexed by the country in 1951, said the protests were part of a ""separatist"" movement led by exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
""The plot of the separatists will fail. We will challenge them firmly, according to law,"" the chairman of the Tibet government, Qiangba Puncog, told reporters in Beijing.
""This is very clear: This is a separatist Dalai Lama clique, inside and outside the country.""
The Dalai Lama called on China to ""stop using force"" and rejected allegations that he and his government-in-exile were behind the uprising.
""These protests are a manifestation of the deep-rooted resentment of the Tibetan people,"" he said. ""Unity and stability under brute force is at best a temporary solution.""
Earlier, Xinhua said many police officers had been badly injured in clashes and that rioters had wielded iron bars, wooden sticks, long knives, backpacks filled with stones and bottles of explosive liquids.
A Chinese tour operator and others in Lhasa contacted by AFP said tanks and armoured personnel carriers patrolled the city on Saturday and remained in place at nightfall.
""There are tanks and armed soldiers on the streets. We have been told to stay in our rooms... the city is shut down,"" Wu Yongzhe, the tour organiser, said by phone.
Wu, other tour operators and travellers said Tibet had been closed to foreign tourists.
Tibet, a mountainous region that includes Mount Everest and is more than twice the size of France, has been a flashpoint for China's Communist leadership since it came to power in 1949.
Communist forces were sent into Tibet in 1950 to ""liberate"" the region, with China's official rule beginning a year later.
Tibet has taken on greater importance in the run-up to the Olympics in August, which the country's leaders hope will be a chance to show off China's rapid transformation into a modern economic power.
Tibetan rights groups have vowed to pile intense pressure on Beijing over its rule of the region ahead of the Games, and any perceived rights abuses now would prove unwelcome news for the Chinese leadership.
The protests are the biggest since 1989, when Chinese President Hu Jintao -- who on Saturday received a second five-year term -- was the Communist Party chief of Tibet.
Chinese censors blacked out Western media reports about developments in Tibet on Chinese television on Friday, and independent verification of the news from the region has been difficult.
But even official Chinese accounts have indicated the protests began Monday, when Tibetans around the world marked the anniversary of a 1959 uprising that was put down with force and led the Dalai Lama to flee into exile.
Those protests, begun by Buddhist monks, grew in the following days before erupting into anti-Chinese rioting on Friday.
Chinese-owned shops, offices and restaurants were smashed and burned by demonstrators.
Rights groups allege that Beijing encourages ethnic Chinese to move into Tibet to culturally take over the region, a process made easier with the government opening a new rail line to Tibet in 2006.
The United States and Britain expressed concern over the violence, with the White House calling on Beijing to ""respect Tibetan culture.""
The US government warned Americans that the ""situation in Lhasa continues to be unstable"" and travel to the area should be deferred. It also advised caution when heading to the ""predominantly Tibetan areas"" of neighbouring provinces.
The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that several US-based tour operators had cancelled trips to Tibet following this week's violence.

"4465",20066413,"Title: Annan appeals for nearly US$4 billion to help 27 million people in 29 countries.rtf; Date: November 30, 2006 Thursday 8:42 PM GMT; Text: Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed for nearly US$4 billion (euro3 billion) on Thursday to help 27 million people in 29 countries ""whose lives have been crippled by conflict and calamity,"" expressing dismay that rich nations have consistently given just two-thirds of the funds needed.
He said the people in need overwhelmingly women and children ""subsist on the very margins of society"" in places like Somalia, the Palestinian territories and Congo.
""These 27 million individuals seek not a hand out, but a hand up,"" Annan told the launch of the 2007 humanitarian appeal. ""Their names may be unknown to us, their lives hidden from view, but their cry for our attention must not go unanswered.""
""In our era of unprecedented prosperity, they are the ones for whom, more than anyone else, the essentials of existence clean water, lifesaving drugs, emergency shelter remain essentially unavailable,"" Annan said.
The 2007 humanitarian appeal for US$3.9 billion (euro2.95 billion) is being made on behalf of 140 non-governmental organizations, U.N. agencies, and other international and local organizations nearly 40 more than last year.
The largest request over US$1.2 billion (euro910 million) is for Sudan, about half for Darfur and half for the rest of the country, followed by US$687 million (euro520.4 million) for Congo, US$454 million (euro343.9 million) for the Palestinians and US$300 million (euro227.2 million) for west Africa, U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland said. It also seeks humanitarian funding for crises in Uganda, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Chad, Burundi, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo.
Annan said the US$3.9 billion (euro2.95 billion) needed amounts to approximately the price of ""two cups of coffee for each citizen in the wealthy countries of the world.""
Egeland said rich nations spend more annually fighting obesity than helping the hungry and needy and much more on pets and ice cream.
""If the rich countries gave one cent per US$100 (euro76) of their gross national product ... we would be fully funded,"" he said, ""and it is beyond me that we haven't reached this.""
Princess Haya of Jordan, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. World Food Program, said she saw on visits to Malawi, Ethiopia and to Syria to see Lebanese refugees that the money ""doesn't go to waste.""
""It really makes people live and that's a scary thought just the difference between life and death is what we're asking for here today,"" said the princess, a daughter of Jordan's late King Hussein of Jordan who is married to Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai.
The 2006 appeal sought US$4.7 billion (euro3.56 billion) and has received US$3.1 billion (euro2.27 billion), or 63 percent. That enabled the U.N. and its humanitarian partners to feed 97 million people in 82 countries, including 6.5 million people in Sudan, vaccinate more than 30 million children against measles in emergency situations and support hundreds of emergency health facilities, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Egeland said, however, that while emergency appeals following conflicts in East Timor and Lebanon were oversubscribed, ""Africa is getting too little resources,"" especially French and Portuguese-speaking countries.
Annan, who is stepping down as secretary-general on Dec. 31 after 10 years, noted that over the past decade he or his representatives had sought funds for humanitarian assistance.
""And each year, I must admit, I have been dismayed that donors have, on average, given only two-thirds of the bare-bones requirements in these appeals,"" he said. ""And for each success story ... there is a contrasting story where help could not be offered for lack of funds.""
""I believe we should, and can, do much better better as nations, and better as the United Nations,"" he told the launch, which included potential donors. ""As an international community, it is our common interest to respond generously to the needs of the most destitute among us.""
Egeland said the goal is to eliminate world hunger and abject poverty, ""and it's within our reach.""
""I think it's a sign that the world is getting better that we're actually asking for fewer dollars for a reduced number of countries"" in 2007, he said. ""Countries like Nepal, Guinea, Liberia were in appeals last year. They are now in a transition stage where we do not need an emergency appeal any more.""

The 6.7-magnitude quake struck an area in the Gangdise mountains inhabited mostly by nomadic herders that lies at an altitude of 5,000 meters (16,500 feet), the official Xinhua News Agency said.
The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, put the magnitude of the 7:08 a.m. (2308 GMT) temblor at 6.0. A quake that powerful can cause severe damage in populated areas.
The epicenter was in Zhongba County, about 560 kilometers (350 miles) west of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and 360 kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Katmandu, the Nepalese capital.
Cracks were spotted in the walls of two houses in the county seat after the tremors, which lasted for two minutes, Xinhua said.
Officials were sent to check on herders in surrounding areas, and a final report could take 15 days, Xinhua said, citing Dun Zhu, head of the county government. It said about 20,000 people live in the county.
""Communication is extremely difficult and precise information on casualties or toppled houses will take some time,"" Xinhua said, citing Dun.
Tibet regularly suffers strong earthquakes.

 The government is to implement its one-year integrated action plan on the work programme before elections. The action plan will give top priority to the elections.
 The action plan aims to carry out military action against the Maoists as well as fill the political void in local government bodies.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 12 Oct 03
A high-level government source says the government will make public the action plan regarding security, development, politics and reform in the coming week.
 Under the security strategy, the government will set up security posts on the highways and entry points to India. The integrated force of the Royal Nepal Army, Armed Police and police force will be mobilized to that end, the source said. The Maoists are said to have been transporting arms and ammunitions through those points in the Terai lowlands .
 The government has a political plan to stick to its old agenda of garnering the support of the political parties. Even though the government has not succeeded in incorporating the parties into the Council of Ministers in the past, the strategy is to make the parties supportive of the plan from without.
 ""The matter was on the agenda of Friday's 10 October cabinet meeting,"" said one minister. ""Before the election processes are complete, the government is trying to implement the programmes that it had made public earlier."" The plan presented by the government during the Maoist peace talks is to be implemented under the ""mobile government"" programme announced one and half months ago.
 The agenda points presented in the talks with the Maoists will be implemented in the ""mobile government"" programme under the one-year work plan. The issues include special treatment of women, the downtrodden, ethnic minorities, indigenous people in education and employment, and positive discrimination in areas of public representation, distribution of citizenship papers, and assurance regarding security.
 The government is to hold the local elections from next Baisakh April to Asar June and the general elections six months after that.

"4795",20061659,"Title: Fewer journalists die but press freedoms still under threat in 2005_ media watchdog.rtf; Date: March 30, 2006 Thursday 7:00 AM GMT; Text: Sixty-five journalists were killed in 2005 -- 13 less than the previous year -- and freedom of the press was still under threat in many countries, according to the International Press Institute's (IPI) annual report, published Thursday in Vienna. 
Iraq, where 23 journalists were killed last year, was still ""the most murderous country for journalists to report from,"" the media watchdog said in its report, titled ""Media Wars: Year Zero,"" which looked at conditions in 175 countries.    
Nine journalists were found dead in the Philippines, three in Bangladesh and Haiti, and 27 in 18 other countries across Africa, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, IPI added. 
The institute, which was founded in New York in 1950 and is present in 120 countries, also emphasised restrictions on press freedoms around the world. 
""In all the regions of the world, governments are intent on hindering the media's work,"" by using press laws, emergency decrees, false arrest and imprisonment, physical violence and intimidation, IPI said last year, on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day. 
""In many countries, the institutions of government refuse to provide up-to-date information, ministers decline to be interviewed and individual journalists or media organizations are excluded from press conferences,"" it said then.  
IPI director Johann Fritz pointed out a British draft legislation ""prohibiting the 'glorification' of terrorism"" following the July bombings in London and an EU discussion over the role of the media in ""radicalising"" terrorism. 
These steps ""signalled a shift in the balance between liberty and security and shaped the political debate over the controversial cartoons of Mohammed published by the Danish newspaper 'Jyllands-Poster,'"" he wrote in his foreword to the latest report.
Fritz criticised China which ""is embracing capitalism without introducing the requisite freedoms"" and ""American computer companies (who) helpfully censored their Internet software"" in compliance with Beijing to establish themselves in the country. 
""In 2005, more journalists were imprisoned in Nepal than in any other country,"" the report pointed out, also criticising countries like the US and France, where journalists were prosecuted for refusing to reveal their sources. 
In Africa, the institute said freedom of the press was ""being swiftly eroded"" and legislation was used to hinder the work of journalists, in particular in Zimbabwe where the ""government has used every means at its disposal to silence the media."" 
""The situation for the mass media in Russia continues to be difficult,"" it also said, adding ""in addition to the attacks on journalists, the media have engaged in a great deal of self-censorship, which was demonstrated by the coverage of the January social-benefit reform protests.""
IPI however praised among others Chile, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama for getting rid of so-called 'desacato' or insult laws. 
The institute will hold its next annual congress in May in the Scottish city of Edinburgh.

"400",20031686,"Title: Hillary pauses to celebrate Everest conquest, then goes back to fund-raising.rtf; Date: May 6, 2003, Tuesday, BC cycle; Text: Fifty years after conquering Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary is still setting himself lofty goals.
As he prepares to travel to Nepal to mark the anniversary of his momentous climb to the summit of the world's highest peak, Hillary is planning to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to help impoverished people living in the Himalayan mountains.
These days, it is those aspirations rather than memories of his historic climb that invigorate the 83-year-old former beekeeper.
""Building schools and hospitals, medical clinics and fresh water pipelines and re-establishing forestry"" were ""the most worthwhile things we have done"" over the past several decades, Hillary said in an interview with The Associated Press.
""I've had a remarkable time, I've had great adventures, I've made extremely good friends … and of course we've been able to be extremely helpful to the Sherpas"" he said, summing up the 50 years since May 29, 1953.
On that day, the 33-year-old New Zealander and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first climbers to reach the 29,035 foot summit of Mt. Everest.
Today, the last obstacle before the domed summit, a 40-foot ice-covered rock face, is called the ""Hillary Step"" in recognition of the triumph.
More than 1,200 people since then have climbed to the peak, and the trail blazed by Hillary and Tenzing is well worn. Officials say at least 180 have died in the process.
This year, a record 1,000 climbers plan assaults on the summit of what the Nepalese call Chomolungma or Mother Goddess of the World. Most will fail to reach the top.
Meanwhile, Hillary and the charitable trust he set up funnels about $400,000 annually into development projects in the Solu Khumbu region of Nepal.
Hillary's trust has built two hospitals, a dozen health clinics, 27 schools, air landing strips, bridges and even restored Buddhist monasteries for the Sherpa people he vowed to aid back in 1953 in return for Tenzing's help in getting him to the roof of the world.
Hillary is looking forward to a ""lively old time at a huge party"" on the 50th anniversary in the Nepalese capital of Katmandu he told the AP from his Auckland home.
At least 100 family and western mountaineering friends and up to 600 Nepalese will attend the May 29 celebratory dinner.
""Time has slipped by but getting all my friends together, both Sherpas and Westerners, will be great fun. There is no question about that,"" he said.
Part of the celebrations will be broadcast live by television back to New Zealand, where Hillary is a national hero.
Within days he will fly to events in London, New York, Washington and San Francisco to raise half a million U.S. dollars for the Himalayan Trust he founded.
Recalling his climb last year, Hillary said he vividly remembers ""many occasions"" when he and Tenzing doubted they would reach the top. Deep ravines and crevasses, avalanches, extreme ice faces and rock walls stood in the way as they struggled upward.
""That's what it's all about really, overcoming those problems even though you may have a sense of fear. I think fear can be a stimulating factor and can help make you drive yourself really to overcome dangerous problems,"" he said.
Everest is not the only challenge he has conquered.
He also has led expeditions to both the North and South Poles and a jet boat adventure up India's River Ganges to its mountain source.
Approaching his 84th birthday in July, Hillary acknowledged, ""I've got to slow down"" and reduce his international fund-raising commitments, but he added: ""how I'm going to do that I don't quite know.""

"1308",2003216,"Title: Destruction of ropeways hinders movement in western Nepal.rtf; Date: October 16, 2003, Thursday; Text: Excerpt from report by Tularam Pandey, carried by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 16 October
 Manma, 15 October: The rural people of Kalikot western Nepal are facing great inconveniences as movement over the Tila and Karnali rivers via ropeways has been restricted with the destruction of the ropeways over these rivers in the hands of the Maoist rebels. Ropeways had been a convenient means of transportation for locals living in the remote and rugged terrain of this district.
 With the intention of keeping off security forces at bay, the Maoists had destroyed five ropeways, two over the Tila river situated at Raraghat, two over the Karnali river at Lalighat and one at Raingilghat, during the fourth week of September last year.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 16 Oct 03
It is learnt that during the attack on Kotbada three years ago, the Maoist rebels had also destroyed the suspension bridges over the Karnali river at Raingilghat and Lalighat so that additional police forces from the district headquarters could not come to the site of the incident.
 Due to the damage of the suspension bridges three years ago, 45,000 locals from 12 VDCs village development committee areas have been directly affected. Similarly, people living in the northwestern part of the district headquarters too have come under the adverse effect of the act of the rebels, affecting mostly human movement.  passage omitted
 Movement of the locals from one place to another has minimized due to the absence of suspension bridges, destruction of the ropeways, the sealing of the entry points by the Maoists and fear of harassment by the security forces.  passage omitted
 However, it is learnt that efforts had been made by DDC the district development committee last January to construct suspension bridge over the Karnali river at Raingilghat to relieve the locals there. But the construction work is still in a limbo due to the Maoists' interference. It seems that the Maoists would continue to pose hindrances to the various development works to be implemented in this area.

"5897",20073479,"Title: Central African ex-rebels to demobilise child soldiers.rtf; Date: May 21, 2007 Monday 2:11 PM GMT; Text: Talks have begun on releasing some 400 child soldiers serving with former rebels in the Central African Republic and returning them to civilian life, the United Nations children's agency UNICEF said Monday.
A statement said negotiations had started ""with non-state armed groups for hundreds of child soldiers enrolled in the north-east of the Central African Republic (CAR) to be released and returned to their families."" 
There are an estimated 250,000 child soldiers fighting in 12 countries worldwide, mainly in Africa and Asia, with some countries deploying children ""on a massive scale"", according to the UN.  
Since 2001, almost 95,000 have been demobilised including in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Afghanistan.
The former rebel chief in CAR, Damane Zakaria, had ""agreed on releasing some 400 children,"" UNICEF said. ""A first list of 220 child soldiers has been given to UNICEF.""
Zakaria, commanding the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) in CAR which lies between Cameroon and Sudan, also said armed youngsters aged between 13 and 17 would be released.
""More than 400 children will be demobilised,"" he told AFP by phone. Zakaria signed a peace accord with the government on April 13.
""The children are still with us,"" he said, without indicating when they would be handed over.
UNICEF said it would start talks with the government on procedures for demobilising the youngsters and returning them to civilian life. 
Negotiations would ""study the feasibility of a release agreement after the UFDR has agreed to sign a final commitment in the coming weeks."" 
The peace accord foresaw integrating UFDR rebels either into government armed forces or back into civilian life, but made no mention of child soldiers.
The UFDR, which surfaced late last year and temporarily occupied communities in the north-east, was one of President Francois Bozize's main enemies before the peace accord was reached.
The Monday announcement followed one on May 9 that the government of neighbouring Chad to the north and UNICEF had signed an accord to end the practice of minors being recruited into the country's army.
Last February 6, 58 countries agreed at a UNICEF-organised conference in Paris to take action to protect children from being recruited as soldiers. They included 10 of 12 nations where an estimated 250,000 children bear arms.
Among the signatories were Burundi, Chad, Colombia, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nepal, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Uganda, all on a UN black list of countries recruiting child soldiers.
Two others on the UN list -- Myanmar and the Philippines -- did not attend the conference.

"5793",20071,"Title: Feature_ Help comes, but agony remains among flood victims in India By Lu Chunhua.rtf; Date: August 9, 2007 Thursday 3:00 AM EST; Text: ""I have lost my home,"" 49- year-old Sukkan Sah said, pointing his finger onto his chest,  indicating how deep the water was when his village was hit by the  severe floods.
    Though floods were receding, knee-deep water showed the fact  that people were just experiencing agony and distress.
    Kalyanpur, a block about 150 kilometers from Patna, capital  city of Indian northeastern state of Bihar experiencing terrible  heavy rains, was one of the worst flood-hit areas in Bihar.
    For people like Sah whose home was washed away by the floods,  they could get temporary shelter and food from some non- governmental organizations (NGOs), private groups, and some  government organizations.
    ""We collect donations door-to-door from those kind-hearted  people, then distribute them to flood-affected people in Kalyanpur, "" Dilip Kumar, a member of Friends Welfare Society (FWS), a local  NGO told Xinhua here on Wednesday.
    Twenty-five members from the FWS were busy with offering  support to those flood-affected people in Kalyanpur. According to  the FWS, about 300 people were killed, 200,000 people affected by  the floods in Kalyanpur.
    Kumar said: ""Every year we will meet floods. However, the  situation this year is very dangerous, compared with the terrible  floods in 2004.""
    Luckily for flood-affected people, a truck loaded with relief  materials came to Kalyanpur.
    Meanwhile, a helicopter hovered over the sky of Kalyanpur.  Kumar said the helicopter should belong to the government,  airdropping some food to the affected people in some parts of  flood-hit areas in India. 
    However, the help from the government was far from enough.
    Sah was a little bit angry because there was no help from the  government. He came to the non-affected area in Kalyanpur for  eating the simple Indian food named Kichiri, a kind of mixed rice.
    ""Though Kichiri does not taste very good, it can save people's  lives,"" Ashwani Sharwa told Xinhua, an organizer of Kalyanpur Help Society.
    Kumar said: ""There were still no international supports coming  to this area.""    
    Luckily, Baptist Global Response, a worldwide NGO came to  Kalyanpur to check the flood situation. A member told Xinhua that  the situation here got better, but the whole flood situation in  South Asia was still not good.
    According to the latest report, this year's floods in India  have been the worst ever in 30 years, with 1,258 people dead, and  30,000,000 people displaced.
    The United Nations termed the flood situation in South Asia as  worst in the living memory, saying thousands of people in India,  Nepal and Bangladesh have lost their homes and livestock and will  have to begin their lives from nothing when the flood waters  recede.

"7316",20115958,"Title: Ukraine 's ex- PM Tymoshenko jailed for 7 years.rtf; Date: October 11, 2011 Tuesday; Text: KIEV, Oct. 11 -- A Ukrainian court found former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of office Tuesday and sentenced her to seven years in prison in a case widely condemned in the West as politically motivated.
She was found guilty of violating legal procedures during the signing of a natural gas import contract with Russia in 2009.
Earlier, under Ukrainian court procedures, the judge reads a a lengthy summary of the case. In the course of the reading, Judge Rodion Kireyev said Tymoshenko inflicted damages of some 1.5 billion hryvna ($190 million) on the national gas company by signing an import contract with Russia in 2009.
Tymoshenko, now the country's top opposition leader, used her power as prime minister ""for criminal ends and, acting consciously, committed actions which clearly exceeded the limits of rights and powers,"" Kireyev said.
The United States and the European Union have condemned the trial as politically motivated, and Tymoshenko has dismissed the trial as persecution ordered by her longtime foe, President Viktor Yanukovych, to bar her from politics. The case has galvanized her supporters, who regularly held rowdy protests inside and outside the courthouse.
Prosecutors say Tymoshenko was not authorized to order the signing of the contract with Russia and say the price for natural gas she agreed to was too high, causing losses to the state budget.
Tymoshenko says that as a prime minister she did not need any special permission to order the signing of the deal. She says her actions helped end a bitter pricing dispute between Moscow and Kiev, which had led to energy supply shortages across Europe.
Tymoshenko has already been jailed for more than two months during the trial for contempt of court.
On Tuesday, the area outside the court building was flooded by helmeted riot police as supporters and opponents of Tymoshenko held competing rallies. Police buses blocked traffic on Kreshchatik Avenue, which runs through the heart of the capital.
(Photo: AFP)
Tymoshenko, wearing her trademark blond braid wrapped around her head, looked composed in the courtroom, occasionally chatting with her daughter Eugenia as Kireyev spoke. She even occasionally addressed reporters while Kireyev read out the lengthy ruling, causing him to become visibly irritated.
""Whatever the verdict will be ... I will continue my fight for Ukraine, for its European future,"" Tymoshenko told reporters during a short break before the verdict. ""Nobody, not Yanukovych, not Kireyev, can humiliate my honest name. I have worked and will continue to work for Ukraine's sake.""
Tymoshenko was the driving force behind the 2004 Orange Revolution, which overturned Yanukovych's fraud-tainted election victory then. Yanukovych staged a comeback, narrowly defeating Tymoshenko in a 2010 presidential vote amid public disenchantment with economic hardships and constant bickering among those who had ousted Yanukovych.
The European Union has warned that jailing Tymoshenko may cost Ukraine its integration with the 27-nation bloc. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

They urged the government to take the Maoist statement seriously and make an amicable environment for talks. They were speaking at an interaction at Reporters' Club Nepal in Kathmandu today 25 September .

 Leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist and Leninist) CPN-UML Jhala Nath Khanal said that the Maoist statement could open the door for talks and said that the government should be ready to call a unilateral cease-fire, if necessary, and revoke the red corner notice and terrorist tag. Khanal said that all the questions posed by the Maoists were logical and democratic and said that the government should answer them all and demonstrate its position.

 Likewise, human rights leader Sudip Pathak said that the talks would be successful if the Maoists make an official decision at the party that they want to solve the problem through talks and make the decision public. Pathak also revealed that a central level leader of the Maoists has been in Kathmandu for the past few days and he has been making contact with him. Pathak said that an international guarantor is necessary for peace talks.

More than 400 guerrillas have been killed in clashes with the government security forces since the breach of truce. The casualties of the government security forces were nearly 100 during the one and a half months period.
The insurgency has claimed nearly 8,000 lives since it began in the Himalayan kingdom in 1996.

Kishor Neupane, a 12th grader at Janata Higher Secondary School, was kidnapped from his home on August 7, his father Ram Prasad Neupane said.
""We last received a call from the abductors on Friday demanding Rs 15 lakh for the release of our son,"" informed Ram Prasad. But Kishor's captors have not contacted his family ever since.
Ram Prasad said the family did not dare inform the police about the abduction for a week as the captors threatened to murder Kishor and his siblings if they reported the incident to authorities.
Meanwhile, police said search for the missing was on. DSP Govind Thapaliya of Palpa said the Neupanes are yet to file a written complaint. ""It would be easier for us to carry out the investigation, if a written complaint were filed,"" he said.
Amid this, Ram Prasad today organised a press conference and announced Rs 1 lakh prize for whoever can get the information about his son's whereabouts.
""I am ready to pay Rs 1 lakh to the person or organisation that can inform me about the whereabouts of my son,"" said Ram Prasad.

""We have just transferred the last post held by the multinational force to the Ituri Brigade,"" Colonel Gerard Dubois, spokesman for the French-led European Union force, told reporters.
The Ituri Brigade is the new name of the UN force in the northeastern province, which has been torn apart by ethnic violence since 1999 with the loss of an estimated 50,000 lives.
A platoon of 58 Bangladeshi UN soldiers took control of the post -- located on the road linking the centre of the regional capital, Bunia, to the airport -- from 35 French soldiers serving with the EU peacekeeping force.
The official handover comes on Monday after a two-week transition that started on August 16, when troops from the French-led force gave up a first control post to their UN counterparts.
The EU force, comprised mostly of French troops and called ""Artemis"", was deployed in June to protect civilians after inter-ethnic clashes in the town.
UN peacekeepers in the region at the time were not only outnumbered but also not mandated to open fire to try to quell the violence.
The new UN force will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower at its disposal, including the use of attack helicopters.
Some 2,400 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Indonesia are already in Bunia for the new UN force, according to Abu Thiam, a military spokesman from the UN force.
Some of those were still deploying, he said recently, adding that a Nepalese contingent would bring the total number to around 4,000 from October.

Hundreds of trucks and buses were stalled by protesters who blockaded the east-west Mahendra highway and Mugling highway that leads to the capital Katmandu.
Police fired several rounds of tear gas and a brief scuffle was reported in the area, which is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of the capital.
The protesters marched to condemn the killing of 12 civilians by a soldier after an argument in a village near Katmandu on Wednesday night.
In Katmandu, college students clashed with police who were trying to stop the protests. Students at the Tri Chandra College in the heart of Katmandu threw rocks at the riot police. No injuries were reported.
In recent days, Nepal has been hit by strikes and protests despite government assurances of an independent investigation and compensation for the victims' families.
The Royal Nepalese Army identified the soldier as Basudev Thapa and said he was killed in the incident at Nagarkot village, but has not said how he died. The army said it was still investigating.
Thapa, who was reportedly intoxicated, got into an argument with the villagers and returned around midnight on Wednesday, spraying them with bullets, killing 12 and wounding 19 others.
Since King Gyanendra seized absolute power earlier this year, saying he needed total control to defeat communist rebels, the army has faced stepped-up criticism from human rights groups for using excessive force and killing civilians.
The Himalayan country's military has been repeatedly accused of violating human rights in its fight against the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to topple Nepal's monarchy and establish a communist state.

The Rastriya Janashakti Party [RJP] and Rastriya Prajatantra Party [RPP] [led by Pashupati Shumsher Rana] have decided to come to the streets and join the seven-party movement. Speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu today, RJP Co-Chairman Dr Prakash Chandra Lohani said his party had morally and politically supported the seven-party movement from the beginning and will soon take to the streets.
He said the king's [new year] message has made the possibility of dialogue more remote. Another speaker at the meeting, RPP Joint General Secretary Khem Raj Pandit, said his party will come out onto the street and help the movement. Mentioning that his party's official line is to participate in the movement, Pandit said an interim government including the Maoists is the only way out of the current crisis.
Speaking at the meeting, a leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified-Marxist-Leninist), K.P. Sharma Oli, said that no agreement or compromise will stop the seven-party movement and stressed that the aim of the movement is total democracy.

On Friday, Arabic television station Al-Jazeera said Filipino accountant Robert Tarongoy and a Nepalese kidnapped earlier in the week have been released by their captors. Nepalese officials confirmed their countryman had been freed but the Filipinos could not.
""As of this hour (0800 GMT), the Department of Foreign Affairs crisis management team cannot confirm earlier media reports regarding the supposed release of (Tarongoy) by his abductors,"" the foreign affairs office said in a statement.
It said Eric Endaya, the charge d'affaires of the Philippine embassy in Baghdad ""is speaking with our contacts in Iraq"" to get information on Tarongoy.
It said the contacts, who were not identified, assisted in efforts to win the freedom of Filipino truck driver Angelo dela Cruz who was seized by Iraqi insurgents in July. The Philippines then was persuaded to withdraw its small peacekeeping contingent in exchange for the life of dela Cruz, a move criticized by Washington and its allies but hailed in the Philippines.
Endaya also is in touch with officials of the Saudi Trading and Construction Co., Tarongoy's employer that provided catering and foodstuffs to the Iraqi army and others, the statement said.
Tarongoy, Nepalese Inus Dewari, an unidentified American colleague and three Iraqis were seized by gunmen from the Saudi company's compound in Baghdad Monday. Two of the Iraqi guards have earlier been released.
Al-Jazeera, the Qatar-based satellite network did not give a source for its information, saying the release of the two hostages comes after the wife of Tarongoy appealed to the kidnappers for his release on the occasion of Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Ivy Tarongoy appealed for her husband's release and reminded his abductors that there are no longer any Filipino troops in Iraq.
""Robert is a good man with deep respect for all Muslims,"" she said. ""My country, the Philippines, has no troops in Iraq. My husband and I wish only the best for the Iraqi people.
""I ask that he be freed as a symbol of goodwill and friendship between the peoples of Iraq and the Philippines,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I do not see any more possible grievances that the kidnappers may have against the Philippine government.""
More than 4,000 Filipinos work in U.S. military camps across Iraq, mostly as maintenance workers and cooks because of the high wages. The Philippines have announced a ban on work in Iraq, but about 2,000 Filipinos have entered Iraq since the ban was imposed.

Mohanbari, located in the far-eastern state of Assam, is home to a nest of MI-17s, the multi-mission choppers being the busiest flying squadron among the 19 air bases of the Indian Air Force (IAF) that dot the frontier region.
The MI-17s, code-named ""Hip"" by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, are the world's most heavily-armed gunships, but IAF commanders said the load-carrying capacity of the Russian workhorses could be put to other uses.
""The terrain here is such that we ferry bulldozers piece by piece, each weighing 2.5 tonnes, to regions where nothing can reach and then they are reassembled,"" said Mohanbari IAF commander Group Captain Ravi Krishna.
The unit, which is India's easternmost post bordering China, is credited with 75 percent of military and civilian operations of the IAF's Eastern Air Command, which has aircraft worth 8.3 billion dollars in the region.
""Our fixed-wing aircraft last year lifted 563 tonnes of load while the MI-17s ferried 3,943 tonnes,"" Krishna told journalists visiting the classified air base for the first time in a decade.
""At such heights the reserve of power available with a truck dangling below is limited and control of helicopters are difficult,"" said Krishna.
Civilian populations, especially from Assam state and in the region of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China and Myanmar, have named the MI-17s ""hovering angels"" because of the civilian role they play.
""We can't rely on planes as often they don't land but when we see the helicopters we know the angels are coming,"" said Manju Pandey, wife of a school teacher posted in Arunachal Pradesh, one of India's seven far eastern states.
""Especially in monsoon or in the case of illnesses, Mohanbari is where we call,"" said Dinesh Thapa from the nearby town of Chabua of the Krishna's unit where besides two squadrons of MI-17s the IAF has also posted smaller choppers.
The far eastern states are called the ""Seven Sisters"" but besides their endearing name the territory is a treacherous region of jagged peaks soaring to 25,000 feet (7,575 metres) and rivers that burst their banks each monsoon.
Homeland campaigns and internecine battles among drug warlords have claimed more than 50,000 lives since India's independence in 1947 while poverty has turned the Seven Sisters into a breeding ground of insurgencies.
""Besides, the Sisters also skirt Bhutan, Bangladesh, China, Nepal and Myanmar which makes our job more difficult when we go into a counter-insurgency mode,"" said a MI-17 pilot who did not want to be named.
The IAF is tightlipped about the role it plays in counter-insurgency but Mohanbari provides a lifeline to troops fighting the guerrillas who stage hit-and-run attacks from secret bases in Bangladesh, Bhutan or Myanmar.
Mohanbari choppers conducted 39 sorties to bring out military casualties from the virtual war zone here last year and have conducted 20 such emergency operations since the beginning of January, a station spokesman said.

 Samacharpatra With every passing day the criticism against the government is growing and now after the nomination of representatives for the local bodies this has become intense. Is it that the government will resort to fisticuffs with the other forces?
 Thapa When the term of the representatives in the local bodies expired fifteen months ago there were two alternatives in front of the government. The first was to extend their term and the second was to hold elections. Unfortunately that could not happen. In the past fourteen months the local bodies run by the government employees despite their efforts could not provide service to the people as hoped.
Samacharpatra, Kathmandu, in Nepali 2 Oct 03, p 5
The people were not getting services on the one hand and on the other hand the donor community was discontented and this forced the government to do something.
 When the local bodies were being run by government employees fear of political vacuum arose. There was a lack of accountability. So due to all these things the government concluded that it would be better to run the local bodies through people's representatives. When immediate elections are not possible, the government has decided to run the local bodies through an all-party committee.
 In this regard we made contacts with several political parties but at institutional level they were not ready for that. So the government formed such committees by inducting the erstwhile people's representatives who were interested to join and a few new faces, to run the local bodies through people's representatives.
 When the government is hoping cooperation from the political parties there is no question of resorting to fisticuffs.  Passage omitted
 Samacharpatra But the political parties have accused the government of working with a motive to prolong its term.
 Thapa The way the political parties are working, it is creating a threat that people would develop aversion towards the parties. The political leaders should be aware of that. Political leaders are giving self-contradictory statements. Regarding the local bodies, they were protesting the local bodies being run by government employees and demanding for an all-party committee to run them. Now we have fulfilled their demand but they are still protesting it. When the local bodies could not be restored as per the law and running the bodies through government employees was also said unacceptable, what could be a better option to this? The parties should suggest. Such statements of the parties hurt the public sentiment.
 So far the government's tenure is concerned, it has a specific goals. And until that goal is accomplished the government will be in place and the allegation that the government wants to prolong its tenure by these works is not true.
 Samacharpatra What is the goal of the present government?
 Thapa The goal of the government is to bring sustained peace in the country and hold the local and parliamentary elections as soon as possible.  Passage omitted
 Samacharpatra Peace is inevitable to hold elections, and to establish peace the government could not make the talks successful. How could this assure one that the government would hold elections?
 Thapa We made efforts on behalf of the government thinking that the Maoists also should be brought into the political mainstream thorough talks. But we have to understand a point that it is not necessary to keep our democratic and constitutional process in a deadlock for uncertain period, for talks with the Maoists not becoming successful.
 All sides should cooperate and create a minimal environment for this. Once that environment is created we should go for local and parliamentary elections.  Passage omitted
 Samacharpatra What about forming an all-party government as demanded by the agitating five parties and your own party president Pashupati Shumshere J.B. Rana?
 Thapa We are always ready to form an all-party government. I have always been speaking that if the political parties are ready, an all-party government can be formed any time.
 Samacharpatra Is it that different models of all-party government were proposed that created all the difficulty?
 Thapa There is no difference in the model per se. In political and fundamental level, there is no disagreement between the political parties and the government. The disagreement is over the person, as to who would become the prime minister. There are no political, principal and ideological differences.  Passage omitted
 Samacharpatra Is it true that Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa is resigning after Dashian over this particular disagreement?
 Thapa Changing government every now and then won't help. And there is no reason to change prime minister. Why should the prime minister resign?
 Samacharpatra He could"

Schools and businesses were shut and traffic kept out of the usually congested centre of Kathmandu, AFP reporters said.
""Gangs of youths have been stopping traffic at various intersections in Kathmandu since this morning,"" a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
The strike was called by the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities, which staged its first, small demonstration in the capital last week.
The group, which plans more protests, wants increased government representation for minority groups and proportional representation in crucial elections due before mid-June.
Nepal's former Maoists rebel and the government signed a landmark deal late last year that pledged to hold the elections to rewrite Nepal's constitution.
Under the deal, the rebels were also brought into the political mainstream, given 83 out of 330 seats in a new parliament.
The protests come after three weeks of violence in the southeast of the impoverished country by ethnic Mahadhesis also demanding increased representation. 
The protests left 29 people dead and prompted the prime minister to promise to give them a greater voice in shaping the nation's future.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese state-owned newspaper Gorkhapatra on 25 March
[Unattributed report: Nepal Maoist leader blames palace for recent massacre]
Butwal [west Nepal], 24 March: The western command in-charge of the Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Top Bahadur Rayamajhi has alleged that the palace was involved in the Gaur massacre [of the Maoists] under the cover of the Madhesi People's Rights Forum.
Speaking at a protest meeting on the killings in Rautahat district in Butwal, Rayamajhi said that the palace forces had found fertile ground for their activities as the nation had headed towards lawlessness and a state of impunity.
Under the cover of the Madhesi forum, Hindu extremists and the royalists had orchestrated the murders and violent attacks in order to disrupt the constituent assembly elections, Rayamajhi said. He also accused that the government was a mute spectator to such happenings.
He said that the seven party alliance was responsible for barring the Maoists from joining the interim government and delaying the constituent assembly elections. He urged the government to take action against the guilty of the killing and declare the deceased martyrs.
Maoist central leader and Lumbini zone in-charge Pampha Bhusal said that the country should be declared a republic and action taken against the royalists before conducting the constituent assembly elections. [Passage: class struggle to continue]

"653",20031913,"Title: South Asian Poor Fare Worst in Cold Snap.rtf; Date: January 20, 2003 Monday; Text: It's for people like Shashi Bala that the cold sweeping South Asian bites the fiercest. In her crowded New Delhi shantytown, where unemployment and disease are rampant and poverty the norm, she stays warm amid near-freezing temperatures because she has no choice.
She has no heater and no hot water. She has to walk to find a toilet or running water. She supports her disabled husband and 2-year-old daughter with the tiny income she gets renting out a small storefront.
""If I started feeling the cold then how would I go on?"" she demanded.
As a monthlong cold wave hammers parts of India, Bangladesh and Nepal, it is the poor who fare the worst in the daily fight against dropping temperatures.
On some days, dozens of them lose that fight. By Monday, more than 1,600 people, many of them poor or homeless, had died of the cold across South Asia.
The regional temperatures would be cozy for January if this was North Dakota or Helsinki, Finland. But in South Asia, where winters are normally short and mild, millions live in shacks or mud-and-thatch houses without heat or electricity. Millions more have no homes and sleep outdoors. In Delhi, where the average January temperature is 58 degrees, the Sunday temperature dropped as low as 39 degrees.
The longest New Delhi cold wave in decades has been compounded by power outages that left many neighborhoods with two-to-three hour electricity outages Sunday, and a thick nightly fog that can reduce visibility to under 100 feet. The fog has repeatedly shut down New Delhi's airports, and caused extensive train delays - some lasting well over a day.
In wealthier neighborhoods, the rush for electrical heaters has left some appliance stores sold out.
That's not the kind of problem they face in Yamuna Pushta, a maze-like shantytown that attracts the poorest newcomers to India's capital.
Here, along the polluted banks of the Yamuna River, Bangladeshi immigrants and Indians who have come from rural areas hoping for better lives struggle to keep their families going. Few have electricity, let alone electrical heaters. Doctors here have seen a spike in bronchial infections and pneumonia.
Bala says she doesn't feel the cold and that even her daughter, Zeva, doesn't let it get to her, playing barefoot in streets covered with garbage and filth.
""I don't know why,"" she said. Then she answers the question herself, saying she has no choice but to endure.
But plenty of others do feel the cold. A woman named Pratima - she uses only one name, and just smiles when asked her age - feels it badly. She covers herself with a shawl and crouches over a cooking fire to try to keep warm. She doesn't have the money to buy firewood for heat. But she still finds a way to feed rice and meat stew to her dog, a squat, friendly mongrel called Pitu that she lavishes with love.
And nearby, a mechanic for the thousands of bicycle-rickshaw drivers who live here feels it, too. Suraj - he also uses only one name - walks into a small wood-and-plastic-sheeting tea stall with his hands covered in grease, his head wrapped in a light brown scarf.
""Since the first of January, the cold is very bad,"" he said, holding his hands out so visitors can feel how frigid they are. He spends up to one-third of his salary, which ranges from 80 cents to $1.60 a day, on firewood. But that only keeps his family warm from sundown until about 11 p.m. Hopefully, he says, they're all asleep by midnight and don't feel the worst of the weather.
He wishes that this year was an election year. Then the politicians would hand blankets and food.
""But there are no elections close by, so no one is bringing us blankets,"" he said.
Forecasters say things could be looking up for the residents of Yamuna Pushta. The cold spell in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is expected to continue into next week, although northwestern India, including New Delhi, is likely to get warmer.
So for millions of poor South Asians, the pain of the cold will continue.
In Patna, the capital of Bihar, the temperature on Sunday dropped to 40.
""When blankets are distributed, the men push ahead and grab them all. We get nothing,"" said Bindu Devi, who lives on the street in Patna with her four children.
""I haven't seen any wood either. I'm burning anything my children can find on the streets,"" she said as she held out her hands to a heap of smoking embers. Around her, the air was heavy with the stench of burning tires.

 A senior leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) K. P. Sharma Oli has alleged that the government's activities are promoting the Maoists and regressive forces in the country. Addressing a party gathering in the capital today Oli strongly criticized the government's anti-terrorism law.
Kantipur FM, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1245 gmt 15 Dec 04However, stating that his party had joined the government to weaken regressive forces and establish peace in the country, he said the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) should not shy away from the government before addressing the challenges.
 Indirectly criticizing the cabinet members from his party, he said he did not believe the present government was demonstrating its true potentials. He said if it members in the cabinet were not able to deliver, they should resign to save face.
 In reference to another issue, Oli said because the Maoists felt they could not win over others through logic and arguments, they had resorted to violence and terror. He said the Maoists are cowards who do not believe in themselves.
 Expressing concern over the inability of political parties to reach a common consensus when the country was going through a national crisis, Oli said political parties were moving in four different direction blowing their own trumpets. In reference to the peace process, he said the Maoists were only interested in coming to power through the use of violence and not really interested in brining peace. He however, said it was the responsibility of the state to bring them to the negotiating table.

"1888",20045094,"Title: Southern Indian state offers three-month ceasefire to Maoist rebels.rtf; Date: June 16, 2004 Wednesday; Text: The southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh offered a three-month ceasefire to Maoist guerrillas Wednesday, paving the way for the start of peace talks with the outlawed rebels, officials said.
State Home Minister K. Jana Reddy offered the ceasefire a day after the People's War Group (PWG) demanded a truce as a prelude to talks to end their decades-long insurgency which has claimed thousands of lives.
""By stopping the combing (search) operations, the government is already implementing a virtual ceasefire. However, in response to the PWG's proposals, the government suggests a three-month (ceasefire) period,"" Reddy told a news conference in the state capital Hyderabad.
Reddy however said said his newly-formed state government was not lifting a ban imposed on the PWG by the previous state administration of ousted chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.
""This matter will be considered at a later stage,"" he said, adding that his government was also accepting the PWG's demand for safe passage for its representatives taking part in peace talks.
The group is also pressing for the formation of a panel to monitor the ceasefire's implementation.
""My government is also ready to set up such a committee to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire, as suggested by the Maoist organisation,"" the minister said.
Wednesday's unilateral ceasefire is the first since 1989 when the then administration halted a crackdown against the leftwing insurgents.
The truce, however, collapsed within a year with Andhra Pradesh accusing the PWG of using the lull in police action to regroup in the region's impoverished countryside.
In June 2002, then chief minister Naidu opened talks but they collapsed after a few rounds when his government refused to accept demands for a ceasefire.
Some 10,000 people have died in Andhra Pradesh in the past 30 years as the guerrillas, who claim to represent the poor, have waged their insurgency against wealthy landowners and the government.
The state government of Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy vowed after taking office last month to try to end the bloodletting through talks with the guerrillas, who are suspected to have links with Maoist rebels in Nepal.
Andhra Pradesh is now governed by India's ruling Congress party.

Text of report by Radio Nepal on 11 June
The tripartite joint monitoring committee that includes representatives of the government, the United Nations and Maoists has agreed to begin the verification of Maoist fighters living in cantonments in different parts of the country from Thursday [14 June].
The verification process was stalled after the Maoists demanded that the government make arrangements to look after the fighters in the temporary camps.
The verification process was initiated after the government decided to make additional resources available for lodging the fighters and after it disbursed the required funds for the month of Jeth [May/June].
After a meeting of the tripartite meeting [today], Maoist representative Nanda Kishor Pun 'Pasang' said that verification of all the fighters is scheduled to be complete in about three months.
Pasang said that about 500 fighters will be verified every day. The process will begin from the cantonment in Ilam, he said.
Training and orientation of the UN verification is reported to have already been complete.
About 32,000 fighters are currently living in the seven Maoist cantonments.
According to a tripartite agreement, only those Maoist fighters who reached the age of 18 before Jeth 12, 2063 [26 May, 2006], and those that were in the Maoist army before that date, will be allowed to remain in cantonment.

"7858",20115996,"Title: 'Expectations were greater than mandate'.rtf; Date: January 13, 2011 Thursday; Text: Karin Landgren, Jan. 13 -- Karin Landgren, Representative of the UN Secretary General, is leaving Nepal on Jan 16 after two-and-a-half years in Nepal as the head of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). Before her appointment as the Chief of UNMIN on Feb 3, 2009, she was the deputy special representative of the Secretary General in Nepal from September 2008.
As the 54-year old former adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs is heading for Burundi next week to take up her new responsibility as the Special Representative of the Secretary General in Burundi, Republica's Kiran Chapagain talked to her about her views on UNMIN's stay in Nepal for four years, her experience in Nepal, issues related to the UN mission and the peace process. Excerpts:
How will UNMIN's exit impact the peace process?
We should look at the immediate short-term impact and the potentially longer-term impact. In the short-term, as the Secretary General said in his latest report, the timing and conditions of UNMIN's departure are not the best. The parties have not come to fresh agreements on monitoring yet. And the monitoring task is not, objectively, finished. The task of integrating and rehabilitating the Maoist army has not progressed. The promised actions in the Nepal Army (NA) [democratization and right sizing] too have not taken place.
How do you see the withdrawal of UNMIN without the completion of the peace process?
There are challenges ahead. One is around immediate monitoring issues and how that would be negotiated. There is an obvious perception of risk if things are left unmonitored. But monitoring is not simply a technical matter of getting someone else into minding the CCTVs. That is the obvious immediate issue with our withdrawal, and the longer term issue is what form the international community's support to the peace process will take.
What does it mean for the United Nations to wind up a mission with the peace process unfinished?
We would like to see our end coinciding with the end of a need for monitoring. So the work that is now being done by the parties around monitoring ideally should have come much earlier; the whole integration and rehabilitation process should have gotten off the ground much earlier. It comes back to the question of what we have been mandated to do. Certainly one of the lessons I am taking away is that the mandate was not shaped to fit the needs on the ground. We were left doing the monitoring without the capacity to influence its conclusion.
In your opinion, who should be blamed for this premature withdrawal of UNMIN?
Blame is a very emotive word. So, I would not use the word myself. UNMIN is here at the request of parties, and, last September, the parties themselves entered into a four-point agreement, which said that it was the mission's last extension. Clearly, the Security Council has also been frustrated by many six-month and four-month extensions that have usually been accompanied by promises from every government that before the end of the next mandate period the process would be completed. At certain points, you realized that this was not going to happen in another four-month or six-month extension. So I think the bigger question is: Why has the process not moved further in what is now almost three years since the elections?
So, why did the peace process not complete even three years after the elections?
Some of the assumptions made at the beginning of the process about the timeframe were unrealistic. But the slowness of the process is also a reflection of the weak architecture of some parts of the process. For example, mechanisms that were foreseen to oversee the peace process commitments and their implementation as a whole were not set up, and there has never been a reliable and routine high-level dialogue mechanism, which the parties could turn to systematically to resolve issues in the manner of the Joint Monitoring Coordination Committee (JMCC). There is no such mechanism for parties. That is a gap in the process. I believed that has slowed down the whole process.
How do you look back at UNMIN's tenure in Nepal?
I look back at it very positively. I would say there are many lessons in this experience for the United Nations and its other missions around the world. Take the issue of monitoring - monitoring that is done by a very light presence, as requested by the parties, by unarmed monitors in civilian clothes has not been tried before. This is a new experience and this has been a major success here coupled with the mechanism of JMCC. It is somewhat unsung as a success.
Some people say UNMIN could not play an effective role?
UNMIN completely performed the task that it was given. We played our part fully. There are many successes, from the beginning of electoral support to the mine action team, which was originally a part of UNMIN; the monitoring with very limited violations, and the discharge of disqualified combatants.

"4731",20061066,"Title: Maoists massacre 20 pacifists ahead of Bush's visit to India.rtf; Date: February 28, 2006 Tuesday 12:43 PM GMT; Text: Leftwing guerrillas killed at least 20 anti-Maoist campaigners Tuesday after ambushing a convoy of trucks ferrying the unarmed activists in central India, police said.
The massacre, the bloodiest in recent years in Chattisgarh state, came on the eve of a three-day visit by US President George W. Bush to India for talks on strategic ties and countering terrorism.
The Maoist guerrillas ambushed five trucks in Dantewada district. After blowing one up they torched the remaining four taking the anti-Maoist activists to their homes in another part of the tiny state, a police spokeswoman said from the remote district.
""Until now, we know that 20 people have died. Around 35 to 40 people are injured. It was a landmine attack,"" said police additional director-general of intelligence S.K. Paswan in the state capital Raipur.
The Dantewada police spokeswoman believed the death toll was higher.
""Our initial information is that 25 people are dead but since it is a very remote area officers are still trying to work out how many are injured, how many are critical and how many have died,"" the spokeswoman told AFP.
The tipper truck was blown up late morning at a village in the district's Darbhaguda area, 550 kilometers (343 miles) south of Raipur, she said.
""Our state police chief O.P. Rathore has rushed to the site by helicopter and soon the picture will become clearer,"" the official added from Dantewada, which nestles on the fringes of the Stone Age jungles of Bastar.
So far none of the various outlawed leftwing groups in the state has claimed reponsibility for the attack.
Chattisgarh police senior superintendent Pawan Dev warned the toll will likely rise as many people were injured and the nearest hospital is about 25 kilometres from where the attack took place.
Police intelligence officer Paswan said the victims were returning to their village of Konta after attending an anti-Maoist campaign in a neighbouring village.
India's junior Home Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said the national government was ready to send reinforcements if the state requested them.
The ""public-awakening"" campaign was organised by a politician. It involves peace marches in which thousands of Chattisgarh residents have been taking part to counteract Maoist violence.
This month alone the rebels have killed 19 security officials and more than a dozen residents in Dantewada district. Paswan said that around 100 people died in 2005 in Maoist violence in Chattisgarh, one of India's newest states.
India's Maoists have bases in several states and have recently stepped up attacks. They say they are fighting for greater economic and social rights for tribes and landless farmers in rural areas.
Accoring to the home ministry, some 9,300 Maoist rebels are operating in the country but security experts say figures are meaningless as leftwing radicals hold sway across wide swathes of the nation's largely-neglected rural population.
The Maoists have been active in India since the 1960s. They have the same ideology and goals as their counterparts in Nepal but do not have links with them.
""Maoists have mobilised hundreds of thousands of people because in most of the places where they operate, there is no state presence, the region is underdeveloped, and state campaigns against them have exposed innocent people to violence,"" said Ajai Sahni, director of the Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management.

Nepal, which is not part of the US-led coalition in Iraq, said the grisly videotape purporting to show the killings of the 12 men marked a ""moment of national despair.""
In Lele, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the capital Kathmandu, hundreds of tearful villagers crowded around the humble home of Ramesh Khadka, 19, who was among those allegedly murdered by the Islamic insurgents.
""We were expecting their safe return. This is very shocking. This is completely unexpected,"" said Sudarshan Khadka, Ramesh Khadka's brother.
""My brother went there just to earn a living. He had nothing to do with the Americans. We are helpless against fanatics,"" the 23-year-old told AFP.
Khadka's father Jit Bahadur Khadka wept hysterically upon hearing the report of his son's death from a representative of a labour agency, witnesses said.
A statement posted on an Islamist website by the Army of Ansar al-Sunna was accompanied by pictures of what was claimed to be the bodies of the hostages. One of them was apparently beheaded while the rest were shot.
A statement after an emergency cabinet meeting under Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba did not indicate independent information on the hostages, saying the government learned of their fate from the news media.
""His Majesty's Government urges the international community to take strongest action against the perpetrators of this atrocity,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
""This barbarian act of terrorism to kill innocent civilians without asking for any conditions for their release is against the minimum behaviour of human civilisation,"" the statement said.
Nepalese officials had appealed on Arabic-language television networks and contacted diplomats and Islamic clerics in the Middle East seeking the hostages' release.
The Kathmandu government has accused employment agencies of exploiting impoverished workers by putting them at risk in Iraq.
""His Majesty's Government also vows to take action against those persons who are found involved in illegal methods of recruitment of helpless Nepalese into Iraq, resulting into this devastating tragedy,"" the statement said.
Ramesh Khadka's father said earlier the family had taken a loan of more than 2,000 dollars for his son's trip in the belief he would be a cook in Jordan.
The sum is a fortune in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries.
The Jordanian employment agency Morning Star has said that the Nepalese headed to Iraq for work in the hope of earning more money.
Nepal's Muslim minority had issued a flurry of press statements condemning the kidnappings. Muslims make up around seven percent of the more than 24 million people in Nepal, the mainly Hindu birthplace of Buddha.
Nepal declined US requests to contribute troops to Iraq, saying its army was busy fighting an increasingly bloody domestic Maoist insurgency which has wreaked further havoc on the fragile economy.
The statement said the reported killings in Iraq were cause to halt internal conflicts.
""At this moment of national despair, His Majesty's Government appeals to the countrymen and women to show their patience for maintaining peace and harmony in the country,"" it said.
The photos released Tuesday showed the beheading of one apparent hostage, the first with him blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back, before his throat was slit. Two men, one in military attire, are seen beside him.
Other pictures showed the actual decapitation, including one where his bloodied head is held up like a trophy by a hooded captor. The graphic video shows the other Nepalese being shot.

Thapa was appointed by King Gyanendra on June 4, provoking strong criticism from most political parties, which are refusing to cooperate with him.
The five main parties are continuing their protests against the king, who in October sacked the elected prime minister, replaced him with royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand and indefinitely postponed elections.
Chand resigned last month, saying he wanted to end the political discord.
The five parties put forward their choice for the premier, but Gyanendra ignored them and instead appointed Thapa, a political veteran.
The king asked him to form a cabinet representing all shades of political opinion, but the parties have refused to join.
The sources said Thapa had also been criticized by senior leaders of his National Democratic Party (NDP) party for not appointing his cabinet ministers from recommendations made by them.
But they said Thapa was expected to announce a ""mini-cabinet"" within the next two days with six appointments from the NDP.
He is expected to retain the main portfolios such as foreign, defence, and home himself until more ministers are appointed.
Thapa met the king twice on Tuesday in connection with the formation of his cabinet, the sources said.
Until the cabinet is formed, government appointments are on hold and no date can be fixed for the third round of talks with Maoist rebels, sources said.
The government and the rebels have held two rounds of talks since they declared a ceasefire on January 29, aimed at ending seven years of insurgency.
The Maoists have said the change in government will not affect the substance of the talks.

Thierry Ehrmann recounts that a Japanese guest, after visiting his home in this sturdy stone village in the gentle hills north of Lyon, remarked, ''I have seen the church of the 21st century.''
  Mayor Pierre Dumont is not so sure. ''It's humanly intolerable, ugly, dramatic, with its images of destruction,'' he said. ''Whatever you think, for me it's not art, it's a provocation.''
 Mr. Ehrmann, 44, is a businessman-turned-artist who over the last seven years has poured his soul, his religious and worldly convictions and roughly $5 million into the transformation of a 17th-century stone house into a complex work of art that he calls ''The Abode of Chaos.'' He became wealthy after founding an online service for determining the cost of art objects and through other ventures. 
  Together with artists from several countries, Mr. Ehrmann, who occupies the house with his two Great Danes, Saatchi and Reuters, has painted the two-story house and the wall around it black and arrayed them with giant black-and-white portraits of noted personalities, including eight popes, as well as President Bush and Osama bin Laden. 
  The garden is strewn with sculptures, mainly by Mr. Ehrmann, including a crashed helicopter, a wrecked oil truck marked ''Halliburton'' and a model of the jagged steel remains of the World Trade Center. A reproduction of an oil platform perches on the roof, which is draped with camouflage netting.
  Mr. Ehrmann, who is married and has two children, began the project in 1999 as a kind of monument to his eclectic religious beliefs, which range from Roman Catholicism to alchemy. Hence the popes, but also numerous salamanders, an animal sacred to the alchemists, cut in steel and affixed to the walls of the building. 
  He said he had chosen the site because it contained the remnants of a Protestant church and graveyard with the remains of 800 people. 
  But Sept. 11, he said, was a turning point, prompting him to focus his attention on aspects of life like war and destruction and hatred and terrorism. Hence portraits of men like Kofi Annan but also Mr. bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Qaeda leader in Iraq who was killed June 7 by an American airstrike. 
  ''Terrorism in the world has 1,000 faces,'' he said, standing under portraits of Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat. ''Always see the face of the other.''
  Mr. Dumont, 70, a retired electrical engineer, had been mayor of St.Romain for 17 years when Mr. Ehrmann began his project on the peaceful Rue de la Republique. ''It's something that brings nothing to humanity; it's completely hare-brained,'' he said in his cramped office, under a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. ''I paint myself -- I have a certain sensibility. But I cannot understand what someone means by an airplane crash, an oil platform.''
  So Mr. Dumont has taken Mr. Ehrmann to court, arguing that he has violated laws concerning building within the town limits. In June, the court ruled against Mr. Ehrmann, fining him and ordering him to restore the house to its original state. A final verdict by an appeals court is not expected until September.
  When Marc Allardon, a neighbor, peers across from his yard at Mr. Ehrmann's house, he sees the crashed helicopter and the oil platform, but they do not disturb him. He considers Mayor Dumont and Mr. Ehrmann equally stubborn. ''I try to mediate between the mayor and Thierry,'' Mr. Allardon said. ''Both are born hardheads.''
  Indeed, Mr. Allardon has begun parodying Mr. Ehrmann, decorating his own home and declaring it a monument to a mock religion. Atop a stone column in his front yard stands a statue of the Virgin Mary arrayed in a rainbow-colored garment. A serpent made of pipe wraps its curls around her; in its mouth a sign says, ''Let's Be Tempted.'' 
  On the roof of Mr. Allardon's house are signs with uplifting words like ''Tolerance,'' ''Utopia,'' ''Joy,'' ''Hope.'' Artificial flowers sprout from the chimney, which is wrapped in green paper.
  Mr. Allardon said he would do more, but his wife, a historian, brakes him. ''She tells me to slow down,'' he said. And what does he think of ''The Abode of Chaos''? ''At the start it was shocking,'' he said. ''Now I like it.'' 
  But Mayor Dumont says it is not only his own sensibility but also that of other townspeople that has been hurt. ''For older people that house was magnificent, with a farm,'' he said. ''People bear that badly.''
  Nicole Floris, who lives just behind Mr. Ehrmann, said it was a ''shame that he ruined a beautiful house, in stone, in the local style.'' But Marie Dumont, her neighbor (no relation to the mayor), said she was not troubled by the look of the house. 
  ''The most disturbing thing are the visitors,'' she said, who arrive every weekend, sometimes in the thousands. ''This is a private road.'' She acknowledged that Mr. Ehrmann ''gave a chance to many artists to express themselves.'' 
  ''Some did wonderful things,'' she sa"

Text of report in English by Paris-based Sudanese newspaper Sudan Tribune website on 30 January
Sudan and the United Nations have agreed to speed up the deployment of the hybrid peacekeeping troops to the war-torn Darfur region and to finalize the status-of-forces agreement for the mission.
Sudanese government spent months resisting a UN intervention before agreeing to a compromise deal for a ""hybrid force"" that would remain predominantly African. It has since vetoed some offers for non-African units and is blamed for a series of bureaucratic hurdles that are delaying the mission.
Sudanese President Omer Al-Bashir and UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon agreed during a meeting held in the Ethiopian capital to accelerate the deployment of the 26000 troops operation in Darfur in order to restore security and quell human rights violations in the region.
The government is still negotiating the legal framework for the force, and even objects to the colour of their helmets, which it wants to keep green in the case of African troops.
The two parties didn't make statements on controversial issues like the non African troops that the UN wants on the ground like the Nordic units and the Nepalese troops.
Sudan also wants the status of forces agreement to include provisions on communications and the movement of troops and personnel, which the UN considers as obstructions that may paralyse the peacekeeping mission. The silence of the two parties after the meeting might be considered as sign of persistence of disagreement.
International experts estimate 200,000 people have died in the conflict, which Washington calls genocide, a term European governments are reluctant to use. The Sudan government says 9,000 people have been killed.
UN Security Council resolution 1769 establishing UN-AU hybrid force provided for a transition from the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to the force known as UNAMID by December 31st.
Sudan's Foreign Minister, Deng Alor, said President Al-Bashir tackled in a meeting with the AU chief Alpha Oumer Konare the importance of coordination between the government of Sudan, the African Union and the United Nations before taking any decision on the hybrid operation in Darfur.
He added that agreement was reached between the two sides on the necessity of coordination, explaining that in this connection two offices for the AU would be established in Addis Ababa and Khartoum for coordination pertinent to the hybrid operation in Darfur.
He pointed out that further meetings would be held between Sudan and the AU for establishment of coordination and executive mechanisms on Darfur, especially the hybrid operation there.

 The four agitating political parties have criticized the government for failing to protect places of religious worship, media houses and public and private property. Following a meeting of the four parties in the capital today, they claimed that the government had no more moral grounds to stay in power because it had failed to protect and provide security to the people following the barbaric murder of twelve Nepalese workers in Iraq.

Issuing a statement after their meeting, the four parties said the practice of running the government through a nominated prime minister without the mandate of the people had clearly failed.
 The meeting also discussed the Maoists demand to hold talk to the King with the help of United Nations facilitation. However, the four parties have said an official view on the issue will be made public after another meeting of the four parties next Tuesday (7 September). The parties have also decided to launch regional protest programmes in Bagmati from 21 September.

Communist party leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, whom the opposition has named as their candidate for prime minister, said he told King Gyanendra that an all-party government had to be formed to end the stalemate.
""I told the king to nominate a prime minister recommended (by the opposition), and form an all-party government to bring the Maoists to mainstream politics to end the conflict in the country as soon as possible,"" Nepal told reporters.
King Gyanendra fired the elected government in October 2002 accusing it of failure to govern Nepal and to end a bloody Maoist insurgency launched in 1996.
His handpicked prime minister, staunch royalist Surya Bahadur Thapa, resigned May 7 after more than a month of demonstrations against the king.
King Gyanendra on Wednesday met other opposition leaders behind more than a month of noisy protests against the monarchy, although no immediate breakthrough was reached.
Nepal said the monarch was serious about ending the impasse. ""The king is in no mood to prolong the ongoing political deadlock,"" he said.
Nepal's meeting at the palace came on the last day of a three-day strike called by the Maoists in which at least 45 people were killed and millions of dollars were lost in revenue, according to officials and industrialists.
The Maoists, fighting to overthrow the monarchy, ordered all shops shut and all traffic off the roads across the Himalayan state of 25 million people.
They called the strike in part to show solidarity with opposition parties.
More than 9,500 people have died in the eight-year Maoist insurgency.

Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 22 February
Two leading donors - Department for International Development (DFID) and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) - have launched the Rights, Democracy and Inclusion Fund (RDIF) to contribute to ""stable democratic future for Nepal"".
Addressing the launching ceremony at Lalitpur on Wednesday [22 February], Mark Mallalieu, head of the DFID - British government's aid arm - in Nepal quoted His Majesty the King, opposition leaders Madhav K. Nepal and Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist chairman Prachanda underlining their professed commitment to democracy, human rights and multi-party competition.
Mr Mallalieu said the new initiative by leading development agencies like DFID and SDC was a legitimate initiative as their support will not be biased and that they will not be providing direct finance to political parties.
""It is legitimate because effective, capable and accountable state and non-state institutions are vital to development and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Without such institutions, surely progress will continue to be slow and Nepal risks trailing far behind its South Asian neighbours,"" said Mallalieu. 
""RDIF provides a new way for donors to promote such effective and accountable government by supporting creative ideas generated by Nepali organizations and people - not by outsiders,"" he added.
Country director of the SDC - the international aid arm of the Swiss government - in Nepal, Jorg Frieden, said development in Nepal had been halted by weak political institutions. He said many citizens of this country wondered if they still could identify themselves with the Nepali state and questioned, in different forms, its legitimacy.
""The suspension of parliament in 2002 and the autocratic rule introduced by the 1 February declaration in 2005 have just aggravated these historical deficits. Arguably the lack of an effective inclusive democracy, ensuring a fair sharing of power and resources among regions, ethnic groups and social classes is at the origin of the present deep political crisis,"" said Frieden. ""Peace will be attained and development will resume only if those historical grievances are addressed and overcome,"" he added.
Frieden further said 12 years of imperfect but real democracy (1990-2002) have allowed hundreds of civil initiatives to blossom, from the FM radio movement to the proliferation of local newspapers, from the organization of the most discriminated group in society to the creation of large movements of local groups, created for instance around the maintenance and use of community forests. ""Our intention is to support with this fund the more original and promising attempts emerging from a maturing civil society,"" he added.
Guest speaker, former minister and political thinker Nilamber Acharya expressed hope that the fund would be an important contribution to the cause of democracy in Nepal and said it was an expression of confidence that Nepal will return to democracy. ""Building democracy is a multifaceted task. Extremism - both right and left - is hostile to democracy. Democracy is both a goal in itself and a means to solve other problems,"" he added.
Acharya recalled that international community too had failed to support democratic movement of Nepal in the past. ""But it was not always the case. We are happy and satisfied this time at the stand taken by the international community after the 1 February royal takeover,"" Acharya said. ""Anti-democratic elements don't make democracy. Democratic initiatives, democratic process and institutions as well as democratic forces need to be strengthened,"" he added.
The DFID and SDC officials said as much as 2.8m pounds (approx. 350m rupees) will be available under the RDIF for a period of next three years.
""Support within RDIF is available to all constitutional forces trying to work cooperatively for the achievement of a democratic process that is agreed and durable. Project proposals can be submitted by organizations legally operating in Nepal, both national and international,"" said a statement issued by the DFID. 
""Small but respected Nepali civil society organizations and academic institutions are seen as credible and appropriate partners for promoting reform. It is also recognized that initiatives must reach out to all parts of the constitutional spectrum. Activities would, therefore, be in support of the declared HMG/Nepal's policy of democratization,"" the statement added.
Interestingly, no government officials were present at the launching ceremony attended by senior opposition leaders, human rights and women activists and dalit community leaders. The organizers said they had also invited senior officials for the launching ceremony.

 Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, property worth millions of rupees has been destroyed and the Nepalese people have suffered for too long and it is now time to put an end to the state of violence and suffering - these were the words of expression by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. Talking in an interview with Bijay Kumar on Nepal Television last night, the prime minister said the people have suffered for too long and their suffering has crossed all limits.
 He said the government is very committed to establishing peace according to the wishes and hopes of the people, and he said he only hoped that the Maoists would have the courage and the will to understand the sufferings of the Nepalese people and help bring about a permanent peace in the country.
Radio Nepal audio web site, Kathmandu, in English 0215 gmt 12 Oct 04
In often short and crisp answers to Bijay Kumar's questions regarding the peace talks between the government and the Maoists, the prime minister said the prospective peace talks would be kept away from the glare of the media, a view which was emphasized by the government's spokesperson, Dr Mohammad Mohsin, after the first meeting of the high-level peace committee last month.
 When asked about the early stages of the Maoist problem, when the Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai had personally met him to put a 40-point agenda to resolve the insurgency, the prime minister said in a solemn voice that he had never expected the Maoist problem to take such a serious turn as it stands today.
 In an answer to a question regarding why the peace process was not moving forward, he said it would make more sense to delay the peace talks than hold a dialogue that was destined to break down.
 Regarding different views being expressed in public by members of the cabinet regarding arrangements for and against a unilateral cease-fire, the prime minister only went on to say the media was not making things any easy as heard , and he refused to express his opinion.

 Bunia, 1 September: A series of militia attacks on the town of Fataki, 60 km northwest of Bunia, have left 200 people dead, 237 abducted and the town deserted, an official of the Hema militia group Union of Congolese Patriots for Reconciliation and Peace (UPC -RP ) told IRIN on Sunday 31 August .
 UPC spokesman Saba Rafiki said the Lendu ethnic militia began these attacks in mid-July, looting then burning homes and shops. Most of the town's residents had fled to Bule, some 7 km from Fataki, he said. There the displaced were receiving aid from Caritas, a Roman Catholic NGO, Rafiki said.
UN Integrated Regional Information Network, Nairobi, in English 1 Sep 03
Fataki was under UPC control before the attacks, he said, but bands of thieves and other attackers had been raiding and looting the deserted town. The UN mission in the DRC ongo , known as MONUC, sent two reconnaissance helicopters over the town on Saturday 30 August and reported it was empty of its residents and destroyed.
 ""The state of the burnt houses indicated that the latest attack took place on Friday 29 August or Thursday 28 August ,"" Leo Salmeron, MONUC's public information officer, said.
 He said that the attackers were suspected to be Lendu and that ""groups of people"" were seen carrying looted property. He said Bule, to which most of Fataki's residents had fled, was calm.
 French-led multinational force to hand over officially to UN forces on 1 September
 Salmeron was speaking in Bunia after a ceremony marking the handing over of the last checkpoint manned by the interim multinational force to MONUC's Ituri Brigade. The UN has mandated its MONUC force to secure the town and the whole of Ituri District. MONUC troops, totalling 2,500 so far, comprise Bangladeshi, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani and Uruguayan contingents. Salmeron said more troops would continue to arrive until 30 September.
 Maj Mohamud Azad, of the Bangladeshi contingent, and Capt Hubert Beaudouin of France, signed documents on the handing over of the checkpoint after an elaborate military process during which the French flag was lowered and the Bangladeshi and the UN flags were raised.
 The official handing over between the multinational force and MONUC is scheduled for later Monday 1 September . A spokesman for the multinational force, Col Gerard Dubois of France, told IRIN that his men had been handing over their positions to MONUC troops since mid-August, and that all the EU troops were expected to leave Bunia by 15 September.

Speaking at a mass meeting organized by the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party in Janakpur, southeast of Kathmandu on Tuesday, Deuba said he regretted the king had said he was ""inefficient"" and removed him.
Gyanendra dismissed Deuba on October 4, calling him ""incompetent"", and took power for a week before replacing him with an interim authority led by staunch royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
He also postponed elections. The new administration is to serve until elections are held, but no poll date has been announced.
""It is only by bringing back the situation prior to that of October 4 that the present political confusion can be eradicated,"" Deuba said.
The king's action has triggered protests from all the main political parties.
The All Nepal Women's Association has collected more than 400,000 signatures for a petition denouncing the king's moves as ""undemocratic"", sources said on Wednesday.
""We handed over a 450-metre long and one-and-a-half-metre-wide cloth scroll with 400,000 signatures to Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand Wednesday,"" former Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist lawmaker Goma Devkota said.

Deuba also said that his party would cooperate with Maoist rebels to restore democracy if they laid down their arms.
""Deuba said if the Maoists agree to lay down their arms, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) was prepared to cooperate with them for their struggle for the restoration of democratic and the constitutional rights of the people,"" said party spokesman Hom Nath Dahal.
While he was prime minister Deuba held three rounds of peace talks with the rebels, but they stalled in November 2001.
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, in an insurgency that has left dead nearly 7,800 people, according to army figures.

Text of report by Ajay Kaul carried by Indian news agency PTI
New Delhi,StartDateStartDate 13 August: Amid renewed skirmishes between the border guards of India and Bangladesh, [the] home secretaries of the two countries are expected to meet by the end of the month to discuss all issues of dispute besides New Delhi's concerns over in-flow of terrorists through its eastern neighbour.
During the meeting, the Indian side is expected to furnish evidence on how Bangladesh is being used as a route by jihadi terrorist groups to sneak into this country, including the suspects of the 11 July Mumbai blasts.
New Delhi has been pushing for home secretary-level talks for some time and Dhaka has finally agreed, an official told PTI.
The meeting is expected to take place by the end of this month in Dhaka, the official said.
India feels that dialogue is the best way to resolve disputes and so it should be pursued.
Probe into the Mumbai blasts is still on and if there is evidence about involvement of Bangladeshis and use of that country's soil, it will be given to Dhaka.
Mumbai police last month said preliminary investigations into the serial blasts had indicated involvement of terror groups from Bangladesh and Nepal.
""Investigations so far reveal the involvement of terror groups from Nepal and Bangladesh and (this) in turn, points at the direct or indirect involvement of Pakistan,"" K.P. Raghuvanshi, the chief of Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in western Indian state of Maharashtra, had said.
New Delhi is also peeved at continued cross-border activities like infiltration and smuggling which often leads to skirmishes as being witnessed for the past few days.
The BSF [India's Border Security Force] and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) have exchanged fire many times along the border.
In one such incident on Friday last, the BSF claimed that it had shot dead five BDR personnel after the latter fired mortars killing two women at an Assamese village on the Indo-Bangladesh border in Cachar district.
According to BSF, Bangladesh has even deployed army along the border.
Bangladesh has reinforced BDR personnel and deployed the army, BSF Inspector General S.K. Dutta said on Friday citing ""inputs received"".
""About 40 to 50 Bangladesh arymen [as received] in BDR uniform are patrolling the border and asking the villagers to vacate the area,"" he said.
New Delhi says the BSF has managed to curb a lot of smuggling and infiltration.
On frequent allegations by BDR that BSF targets innocent Bangladeshis, official sources here said that the Indian border guards hit at only those people who come into this territory and engaged in some kind of illegal activity.
""All BSF actions are on the Indian territory. If a Bangladeshi national is on Indian soil and that too at night, he has no business to do so,"" an official said.

A few managed to reach the gates of the fortified complex in Katmandu but police detained them, along with about 300 other protesters who had been held back from the gates by a line of security officers, police official Ramesh Thapa said.
Thapa said the protesters would be freed later Friday and that no one would be charged.
There was brief scuffle between the protesters and police, but no one was seriously injured, protesters said. They asked not to be named saying they were afraid of the police.
Nepal has said it cannot allow protests against any friendly nation, including China, and have ordered police to protect foreign diplomatic missions. Protests near embassies have not been tolerated.
Tibetans have been protesting in Katmandu against Chinese control of Tibet almost daily since March.

"5409",20065609,"Title: Nepal mulls using retired Gurkhas in peacekeeping role.rtf; Date: December 7, 2006 Thursday 12:50 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's government, Maoists and the United Nations may use retired Gurkhas, famed worldwide as professional soldiers, to monitor a ceasefire and move forward a peace process, the UN said Thursday.
""Both of them (Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and rebel leader Prachanda) expressed some interest in a temporary arrangement whereby perhaps Nepalis who have served in the Indian or British armies might be able to assist in the early stages of monitoring, particularly in the early stages of storage,"" said chief UN representative in Nepal Ian Martin.
Nepal's government and the rebels have invited the UN to monitor Maoist camps set up to house arms and soldiers in seven areas throughout the country, and an initial deployment of 35 UN monitors was expected to arrive in the next few weeks, Martin said.
""Recruitment of those 35 is going ahead. I can't tell you exactly when they will be arriving but we hope it will be in the next two to three weeks,"" Martin said.
The monitors slated to arrive in late December, however, would not be able to cover all the rebel camps, Martin said, adding that Gurkha soldiers -- special regiments of Nepali soldiers in the Indian and British armies -- had a long history of UN peacekeeping missions.
The rebels and government signed a landmark peace accord last month that will see the rebels enter government in exchange for placing their army and weapons in camps under UN monitoring.
An assessment team from UN headquarters would arrive in Nepal at the weekend to  ""develop an overall plan and concept for the United Nations mission that will deliver the various forms of assistance,"" Martin told reporters.
The agreement that outlines the UN role still needs to be signed by the world body, as it needs some ""minor clarifications in wording"", said Martin, UN chief Kofi Annan's personal representative on Nepal's peace process.
Martin returned from New York Wednesday, where he had briefed Annan and the security council on developments in the peace process.
The former Maoist insurgents control large swathes of the Nepalese countryside and claim to have 35,000 fighters, but other estimates put their numbers at closer to 12,000. In recent weeks they have faced fresh accusations of forcibly recruiting new cadres to swell their numbers.
They have long said they eventually wanted to merge their People's Liberation Army with the 90,000-strong Nepal army.
Under the peace deal signed last week, the Maoists would take 73 seats in a 330-seat interim parliament that would pave the way for fresh elections next year to a constituent assembly.
The assembly is to rewrite the constitution and decide the fate of the 238-year-old Nepalese monarchy.
The Maoists and an alliance of seven political parties led mass protests in April that forced King Gyanendra to abandon 14 months of absolute rule he said was needed to crush the Maoist rebellion.

"137",2003469,"Title: Nepal editorial flays _self-serving_ British stance on Gurkhas.rtf; Date: October 19, 2003, Sunday; Text: Text of editorial headlined: ""Gurkha recruitment""; published by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 18 October
 British Gurkhas bring home 56m sterling-pound annually in the form of remittance and pensions. That is a hefty contribution. But no Nepali can accept that if it comes at the cost of national pride and dignity. British Ambassador Keith Bloomfield, at a news conference organized in the capital on Wednesday 15 October , compared the pension of a retired British Gurkha captain with the salary of the Nepali prime minister to drive home the point that British Gurkhas' pension is fair and adequate. This comparison is unjustified and derogatory, to say the least.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 18 Oct 03
The Nepali prime minister, or any other country's prime minister for that matter, does not work for money. Thus the salary of the prime minister is not comparable with any other job unless one intends to make an insensible comparison aimed at hurting national sentiment.
 The comparison also does not make a good case for disparity in the pension between the British Gurkhas and the British nationals in the British army. The UN does not pay less pension to its Nepali permanent employees simply because cost of living is low er in Nepal than in New York. Nor would Kofi Annan accept his pension based on Ghana's living standard.
 In fact, no-one buys the self-serving British argument for pension disparity based on cost of living and nationality. Foreign nationals serving in the American military, who number around 31,000, do get salary and pension, at par with the locals. There is no discrimination in the salary and pensions based on nationality. The disparity in pensions in the British army is therefore an institutionalized case of discrimination and racism even by the US standard.
 This discrimination has also been picked up by British intelligentsia. Daily Mirror, a respected British daily, in its editorial on the death of Sgt Bala Ram Rai, a British Gurkha who died in June 1999 while clearing unexploded NATO bombs in Kosovo, remarked that the compensation Rai's family would get would be far less compared to the cost of bomb that killed him.
 The British Royal Court judges may have ruled against the case filed by GAESO Gurkha Ex-Army Servicemen's Association citing World Bank's average per capita income estimates of Nepali, but that does not end the struggle for equality and justice for the Gurkhas within and outside Britain now and in future. What one is entitled to is not only just money but also the respect that sweat and blood ask for.
 It is also time for the government and the Nepalis to rethink about the Gurkha recruitment. Nepal was much closer militarily in 1816 to the East India Company. But as a non-aligned country in 2003, it is high time the government and political parties reviewed the process of recruiting Nepalis in the British army to serve and fight for countries who think discrimination is something the ""Gurkhas"" deserve.

"3900",20053157,"Title: Nepal keeps ex-premier in custody for refusing to testify on graft.rtf; Date: April 28, 2005 Thursday 9:24 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's ousted prime minister has been put in judicial custody until Monday after he refused to testify to a powerful anti-graft body set up by the king to tackle widespread corruption, an official said Thursday.
Sacked premier Sher Bahadur Deuba is the most senior politician to be arrested by the anti-corruption commission since it was set up by King Gyanendra following his February 1 power grab.
""The commission has sent Deuba to one week's judicial custody for further investigation after he refused to testify on Thursday ... as there is a possibility of tampering with evidence if he is released,"" a commission official said.
Deuba's lawyers insisted he would not testify and have contested the legal basis of the commission.
""It is a seriously illegal and unconstitutional action of the commission to detain political leaders,"" said Srihari Aryal, senior legal advisor to the ex-prime minister.
""It is not necessary to go to the commission to explain ... any activities that involve legal actions as it was formed unconstitutionally,"" he said.
""If we go there and take the case, it will be seen as legalizing the actions of the commission. So we will not go there and this is our stand, "" Aryal said.
""Deuba will not give his statement since we have advised him not to,"" the lawyer stressed.
Under Nepalese law an accused person should be produced before a court within 24 hours of his arrest.
""The investigating officer can ask for detention of an accused person for seven days or for a maximum period of 30 days,"" the commission official explained.
Dozens of police stormed Deuba's Kathmandu house before dawn Wednesday.
""They also cut telephone and electricity lines to his house before forcefully taking him away,"" Nepali Congress (Democratic) party spokesman Minendra Rijal said.
Deuba, freed last month from house arrest, has accused the panel of waging a vendetta against opponents of the monarch's power grab.
Deuba had ignored a summons to appear before the commission, which is probing alleged irregularities in awarding contracts, including a 13.1-million-dollar deal to build a roadway for a drinking water project for the parched Nepalese capital.
Ex-minister for works Prakash Man Singh has also been arrested for refusing to appear before the commission, which has sweeping detention and punishment powers.
Both men have denied any irregularities in the awarding of the contracts being examined by the commission, which has already questioned six other members of Deuba's cabinet.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the king to restore democracy quickly.
""The UN and myself would want to see a return to constitutional rule as soon as possible,"" Annan told a news conference in New Delhi.
""I think it's important that political parties are allowed to resume their activities.""
Gyanendra seized power saying the government had failed to tame a bloody Maoist revolt and stage general elections.

At a meeting with President Joseph Kabila, the heads of the militias operating in Ituri promised to help facilitate the UN peacekeepers' mission in the district, Petronille Waweka, who chairs Ituri's interim assembly, said in a statement.
The pledge came as heads of Ituri militias met in Kinshasa to discuss peace in the troubled province -- where ethnic clashes have claimed 50,000 lives and displaced half a million people since 1999 -- as part of the overall peace process in the DRC.
A UN peace mission, known as MONUC 2, will take over on September 1 from the UN-mandated, French-led EU mission that has been stationed since June in Bunia, the regional capital of Ituri.
The militias also pledged their commitment to the success of a UN-trained police force to be deployed in Ituri, Waweka said.
MONUC plans to train 1,200 police officers by the end of the year to facilitate political transition in the country.
Some 2,000 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay and Bangladesh, are already in Bunia. A Pakistani and a Nepalese contingent will bring the total to 4,700 over the next few weeks.
The interim French-led MONUC 1 was confined to Bunia and was authorised to fire only in self defence, while MONUC 2 will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower, including attack helicopters.
MONUC 2 hopes that Bunia will be sufficiently stabilized so that it will be able to operate in the rest of the district.

Text of report by Indian newspaper The Asian Age website on 21 June
Bhubaneswar, 20 June: Intelligence reports have long been indicating the nexus between Maoists in India and their counterparts in Nepal. The Orissa police finally have the proof of this nexus.
The police has recovered six CDs during a recent raid on a Maoist hideout near Mandrabaju in southern district of Gajapati. The CDs which are in Nepali language feature many prominent Maoist leaders of Nepal and throw light on their organizational apparatus and training.
The CDs were found along with some arms and Maoist literature a week after the Orissa government banned the CPI (Maoist) [Communist Party of India-Maoist] and seven of its frontal organizations. ""We had intelligence inputs, but no clear-cut evidence of the Nepali nexus. The recovery is significant in the sense that it makes the trans-national connection amply evident. It is also a proof that the rebels on both sides have been helping and strengthening each other,"" Gajapati SP A.N. Sinha said.
The police said the CDs trace the history of Maoist movement in Nepal and provide ideological and strategic inputs.
The police are yet to identify all Nepali Maoist leaders figuring in the CDs but the picture of Maoist chief Prachanda has been recognised.
Mr Sinha said: ""In all 14 CDs, including some in Hindi and Oriya, were recovered.""
They mostly feature inspirational movies to attract people to join their cadres. One of the CDs is titled Balidan (sacrifice) while another is named Lal Salam [red salute].
Meanwhile, the Orissa government has decided to proactively pursue its anti-Naxalite [anti-Maoist guerrilla] operations and last week submitted a 33 crore rupees [about 7.2m dollars] annual action plan to the Centre [Indian federal government].
