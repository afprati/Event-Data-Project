"3203",2004104,"Title: Nepal to eliminate child labor by 2014.rtf; Date: December 21, 2004 Tuesday 11:01 PM EST; Text: The Nepali government has a 10- year master plan to eliminate all forms of child labor by the year 2014, a senior official said here Tuesday.
    The government has also planned to emancipate 127,000 children  involved in the worst form of child labor by 2008, Narayan Prasad  Silwal, secretary at the Ministry of Labor and Transport  Management, told reporters. 
    According to a survey conducted by the ministry, there are 2.6  million child labors in Nepal. The largest number of them, figured 55,600 are engaged as domestic labors, while 4,200 are in carpet  industries, 4,000 in the streets, 46,000 are child porters, 12,000 have been trafficked and 17,000 are bonded labors.
    The survey shows that 14,000 children are involved in unpaid  jobs and 278,000 get paid less than they deserve. Only 6.4 percent of the total child labors have got opportunity for education.
    Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in  1990, one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General  Assembly, and has also signed tow optional protocols on the  involvement of children in armed conflicts and the sale of  children, child prostitution and child pornography, which were  adopted in 2000 and came into force in 2002.

"4435",20067010,"Title: Nepalese communist rebel leaders freed from Indian jails.rtf; Date: November 30, 2006 Thursday 1:36 PM GMT; Text: Two senior Nepalese communist rebels were freed from Indian jails on Thursday years after they were arrested on separate charges, news reports said.
Mohan Vaidya, who is among the top five Maoist rebel leaders, and Chandra Prakash Gajurel, a Maoist member, were freed on Thursday after months of pleading with the Indian government.
The independent Kantipur radio station said the two were expected to reach Nepal later in the evening.
Vaidya was arrested in the northeast Indian city of Silguri while he was receiving eye surgery in 2004 and Gajurel was picked up at the airport in Chennai in South India the same year while trying to board a plane. Gajurel was moved later to Silguri.
Maoist rebels had been asking the Indian government to free them since they declared a cease-fire and began talks with the Nepalese government earlier this year.
Maoist leader Prachanda visited India earlier this month where he urged leaders to help secure their release.
The rebels routinely hid in India during the years when they were fighting the government. Nepalese citizens do not require any documents to cross the border and it was easy for them to slip across the border to hide or get medical aid.
The Maoists are no longer deemed terrorists and are scheduled to join an interim Parliament and interim government soon after they ended their decade-old insurgency.
Under the peace agreement signed between the government and rebels earlier this month, thousands of rebel fighters are to be confined in U.N. monitored camps and their weapons locked up until elections next year.

"1133",20033297,"Title: AP interviews_ Indian air force upgrading bases in case of another war with China.rtf; Date: October 14, 2003 Tuesday; Text: While Indian and Chinese politicians try to settle border disputes and increase trade, the Indian air force worries about China's spreading influence and is installing surface-to-air missiles at bases that would be the first defense in case of war.
Air force commanders in eastern India are wary, but then, that's their job. They told The Associated Press this week about a sequenced plan to deactivate and refurbish the Kalaikunda and Hasimara air bases in West Bengal state and Tezpur in Assam over the next few months.
Squadrons from each base will move to another during the upgrading of runways, installing of precision approach radars and improving of air traffic control equipment. The airmen have already been moved out of Kalaikunda.
The improvements include the induction of surface-to-air missiles at the eastern bases, a top Indian air force officer told the AP on condition of anonymity.
India shares its eastern borders with China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, but it has fought a war with only one of those countries, China, in 1962. There was also a limited frontier clash in 1986.
""We are concerned about the strategical encircling of India by China, which wants to have an influence over the Indian Ocean,"" said Air Commodore K.K. Nowhar, commander of India's Hasimara air base, 700 kilometers (435 miles) north of Calcutta.
""It's important to remember China says often the Indian Ocean is not India's ocean,"" Nowhar said in an interview Monday.
""The Hasimara air base is strategically important as it is the nearest to the Chinese border and can take out the Chinese airfields in and around Tibet the first thing,"" in case of war, Nowhar said.
The improvements of the air bases will ensure that all of India's top-line fighter aircraft can operate from them, he said.
Following their 1962 border clash, India and China remained wary for decades. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said at the time the nation tested nuclear weapons in 1998, that ""China is enemy No. 1.""
Only this year have they have taken important steps in settling one part of their long, disputed border. They agreed to open a highway across the frontier in the Buddhist majority region of Sikkim after a visit by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Beijing in June. China recently dropped from a government Web site a reference to the Indian state of Sikkim as a separate country.
Yet, during Vajpayee's visit to Beijing, the Indian foreign ministry said, a Chinese army patrol had entered Indian territory in the state of Arunachal Pradesh and briefly taken Indian soldiers prisoner.
China claims 90,000 square kilometers (34,750 square miles) of land in Arunachal Pradesh. India says China still holds 38,000 square kilometers (14,670 square miles) of its territory at Aksai Chin in Kashmir.
India and China are among the world's fastest growing economies and both countries aim to double their bilateral trade to US$10 billion by 2004.
India's exports to China are increasing at about 100 percent annually. The two countries are also increasingly co-operating on international issues such as the situation in Iraq and negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
Encouraged by their improving relations, India and China want to start negotiations on a possible free trade area, The Times of India reported this week.

Luanne Freer, who is working at a medical camp run by the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA), sent a message to her headquarters in Kathmandu saying that delays to the clearing of the route to the summit and the fixing of ropes above South Col camp had promped the climber to delay his attempt.
Lhakpa is out to break the record of 16 hours 56 minutes set by Babu Chhiri in 2000.
""Lhakpa is confident of accomplishing the speed climb feat in between 12 and 15 hours,"" Freer said in her message.
The president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), Ang Tshering Sherpa, told AFP he would prefer conditions to be perfect and the route well-trodden by the hundreds of other climbers expected to make an assault on the summit in the next few days before Lhakpa sets off.
""After the use of the route above the South Col to the summit by many climbers, the snow on the passage would be properly set and hardened,"" he said.
Many climbers were Tuesday waiting at camp four, situated on South Col at a height of about 7,985 metres (26,194 ft), waiting for good conditions before heading towards the summit, Freer added.
An official of the mountaineering divison of the Nepalese Ministry of Tourism said other reports from the base camp indicated ropes were being put in place to allow teams to begin their final summit bid late Tuesday night.

"6889",20081054,"Title: Nepal Maoists make public _common minimum programme_.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: August 3, 2008 Sunday
Text of report headlined ""Maoist common minimum programme public"" published by Nepalese newspaper Rajdhani on 3 August
Kathmandu, 2 August [Saturday]: The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has made public a 50-point common minimum programme [CMP] to form a government of national consensus. The Maoists made public the CMP at their meeting with 24 other parties at the Maoist parliamentary party office in Singha Durbar [central secretariat] on 2 August. The parties have said they will first discuss the Maoist proposal before endorsing it. Maoist spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara said the parties will give their view on the CMP at the next meeting of the 25 parties.
Nepali Congress representative at the 2 August meeting, Arjun Narsingh KC, said the CMP does not mention Maoists' responsibilities and is not clear about how the peace process and the constitution writing process will be taken to a conclusion in accordance with the past agreements reached between the Maoists and other parties.
He said his party informed the Maoists that the three Maoist conditions [the alliance among the Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist [CPN-UML] and Madhesi People's Rights Forum should break down; the parties should not topple Maoist government for at least two years; the CMP should reflect majority Maoist agenda are not acceptable. He said the Maoists did not consult the Nepali Congress before making public the CMP.
CPN-UML leader Bhim Rawal, who was present at the meeting said his party will make its view public only after studying the draft CMP presented by the Maoists.
The CMP expresses commitment to national independence, territorial integrity and inclusive multi-party democratic system and lasting peace.
""Nepal's foreign policy will be redefined in line with the changed political situation and the objectives of a democratic republic, and the functioning of the foreign service and Foreign Ministry will be restructured on the basis of the country's current needs,"" the CMP reads.
The CMP also says the property of the former king and his family members that were misappropriated from state coffers and hidden inside and outside the country will be identified and nationalized.
The CMP by Maoists also says radical changes will be made in the judiciary and small loans taken by the victims of natural disaster and the conflict, small farmers, who are below the poverty line, and small-scale entrepreneurs will be waived. The draft CMP also speaks about restructuring the National Planning Commission.
The CMP speaks about strengthening the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority to make corruption control mechanism effective through public cooperation and participation. However, the form of public participation is not clear.
The CMP speaks about revolutionary land reforms, ending feudal ownership of land, bringing about industrial peace and creating special atmosphere for investment and punishing the wilful defaulters.
The CMP says education up to higher secondary level and employment are people's basic rights and the rights shall be guaranteed, the country shall be declared free from ""untouchability"" (caste discrimination) and the disabled and senior citizen aged 70 will be provided allowances.
The CMP also speaks about providing loans without collateral to those aspiring to engage in self-employment. It also speaks about preparing a database of unemployed people in the country and constituting a powerful National Muslim Commission.

"3008",20045207,"Title: A bloody war for power leaves Nepal powerless.rtf; Date: August 26, 2004 Thursday 3:19 AM GMT; Text: Trekking his way up one of the steep forested hills of central Nepal, schoolteacher Lumnath Lamichanne was pounced on by five men with knives and hammers who slashed his body and left him for dead.
Lamichanne knew the aggressors -- Maoist rebels angered he belonged to a rival teachers union. But eight years after the attack, no one has been punished; the police and courts told him they had no power to prosecute suspects in their midst.
Countless stories like Lamichanne's are heard across the Himalayan kingdom, where a bloody war for control between the government and rebels opposed to the monarchy has shattered any semblance of order.
""There are army checkpoints and you feel secure for a moment. But once you move away then all is up for grabs,"" said Lamichanne, whose legs still bear the scars from the attack.
Some 10,000 people have died since 1996 in the increasingly deadly conflict. The rebels, who are inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong and Peru's ruthless Shining Path, claim to have set up parallel governments in the countryside that serve Nepal's impoverished rural majority.
But it remains unclear whether either side is actually in power with skirmishes reported daily throughout the Himalayan nation wedged between China and India.
""There is no parallel government in Maoist areas. The reality is anarchy,"" said Subodh Pyakurel, who heads a leading Nepalese human rights group, the Informal Sector Service Center.
A Western diplomat in the capital Kathmandu said the frequently cited figure that the rebels were present in 80 percent of the kingdom was misleading.
""Eighty percent doesn't mean they're in exclusive control; the army can also move in those areas. Eighty percent is effectively no man's land,"" the diplomat said.
""The only regular activity of these parallel governments seems to be Maoists extorting money. It's not as if they're providing public services of any kind. There are kangaroo courts that hear complaints but there is no systematic form of justice,"" the diplomat said.
But the diplomat said the military also had limited influence in vast stretches of Nepal, whose rugged terrain and vast diversity have always limited central government influence.
The Maoists have attempted to wipe out whatever symbols of Kathmandu were in the countryside, trashing power plants, bridges and government offices.
The rebels also tried with moderate success to show their power in Kathmandu by ordering a blockade against traffic entering and leaving the capital for a week this month.
In a country so hetereogenous that some 120 languages are indigenous, Lamichanne's city of Gorkha is exceptional in its influence.
Besides being the namesake of the kingdom's most famous human-resource export, the Gurkha regiment of the British military, the city 150 kilometers (95 miles) west of Kathmandu is the ancestral home both of King Gyanendra and the Maoists' top ideologue and negotiator Baburam Bhattarai.
Krishna Pokharel, a teacher trainer, was Bhattarai's roommate in the 1960s at a Christian missionary school here. And Pokharel knew an agriculture teacher at a local school named Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- before he went underground and became Comrade Prachanda, or ""The Fierce One,"" supremo of the Maoists.
So who does Pokharel think holds the upper hand in what could be as representative as towns get in Nepal?
""People want to be aloof from both sides. When the king comes, ordinary people attend functions because they're compelled. And when Baburam came in the past, the Maoists forced people into activities,"" Pokharel said.
The lack of order has been felt by Pokharel. He said he has remained on good terms with Bhattarai, who wrote him letters when he was not in hiding.
But in his classroom, Pokharel showed bullet holes from two unsuccessful attempts to kill him. He believed the attacks were carried out by Maoists angered that he questioned the strength of his former roommate's ragtag army.
Despite the bloody attacks carried out by the Maoists, its two top leaders showed little signs of violence before their revolutionary days, according to Pokharel. 
He remembered Bhattarai, who went on to be an engineer, as a quiet perfectionist who would nudge him in class to express opinions he was too reserved to voice himself.
""Baburam was very ambitious. He always wanted to be the best. If he had joined the Nepali Congress,"" a top mainstream party, ""he would have been a small leader but with the communists he can be a supreme leader,"" Pokharel said.
""If the government really wanted to solve this problem, they could kill Prachanda and Baburam. But they don't want to, because so long as this problem is there they can use it to justify their own quest to expand power,"" he said.

 Kolti, Bajura District, far western Nepal , 11 October: After Maoist rebels destroyed the control tower and office buildings of the Civil Aviation Authority here in Kolti on 8 March 2002, the control room has been shifted to a tiny rented room of a local house, causing peril for flights coming in and going out of Kolti airstrip.
 The control room staff has to communicate manually with pilots and the control tower by popping out from a window, from where the view of the runway is not clear at all. There are no instruments to gauge and forecast the weather, nor any safety equipment in case of any untoward incident or emergency.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 12 Oct 04
""We have to inform pilots about weather conditions after looking at the sky, and information on air pressure is provided after checking how much the leaves on a nearby tree shake,"" said an official, revealing the inherent danger of plane travel here.
 With the announcement of the state of emergency in the country, the security forces guarding the airfield were relocated to the district headquarters Martadi. Maoist rebels, who were looking for just such an opportunity to cut off the area from the rest of the country, damaged all the buildings by bombing them.
 Locals heaved a sigh of relief when security force personnel were redeployed for the security of the airfield on 27 April 2003 and flights to Kolti airstrip, though few and far in between, resumed.
 ""Although a few private airlines and chartered flights have risked landing planes here, a hundred per cent safety factor cannot be assured in the lack of required equipment and office building,"" according to one of the office staff.
 ""We have had narrow escapes a couple of times as information we provided was not accurate and quite different from what was actually happening on the runway, which in any case was most often misunderstood by the pilots, "" said Bal Kumar Singh, chief of the control tower office here in Kolti.  passage omitted
 ""The government's apathy towards the gravity of the case has resulted in a worrisome flight for passengers flying in here,"" a local accused.
 Further, to add to the locals' woes they have had to pay very high fares to private airlines companies, as a result of the inconsistent and irregular flight schedules of the state-run Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation.

The protesters, who remained peaceful as hundreds of riot police kept watch, also want immediate parliamentary elections.
Similar marches have ended in violent clashes between police and the demonstrators.
Nepal has been hit by political turbulence since King Gyanendra fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in October 2002, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control an insurgency.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 for a communist state. More than 8,500 people have been killed.

The move follows widespread criticism of the rebels after they blew up a bus two weeks ago killing 36 people -- mainly civilians -- in an incident they later acknowledged was a ""grave mistake"".
""Our party has issued special instruction to its entire party rank and file, the people's liberation army and all organs of the new people's government to halt physical action against unarmed individuals until further decision,"" said Maoist party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda.
""The party has instructed them not to take physical action against unarmed individuals, regardless of whatever crimes they might have committed,"" he said in a statement received here Monday.
""Never has it been our party policy to use force against any innocent and unarmed political workers or general public,"" the statement said. ""We have effective measures to ensure that such mistakes do not recur in the future.""
Prachanda hailed an alliance formed by seven political parties who have been sidelined since Gyanendra seized absolute power on February 1, claiming the elected government had failed to end the nine-year insurgency in which some 11,000 people have died.

The Maoists had walked out of government in September but agreed to return after lawmakers on Friday formally approved an agreement to abolish Nepal's centuries-old monarchy and declare the country a republic.
""The cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the naming of five Maoist ministers,"" Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, minister for water resources, told AFP. 
Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara is to become minister of information and communications, Karki said.
Former rebel leaders Dev Gurung and Matrika Prasad Yadav would be given the ministerial posts for local development and forestry, respectively.
Two women, Hisila Yami and Pampha Bhusal, are to receive portfolios -- Yami will become the minister for planning, while Bhusal will oversee the ministry for women, children and social welfare.
""We will join the government from Monday,"" Mahara told AFP.
The ultra-leftists, who ended a decade-long insurgency by reaching a landmark peace deal with Nepal's mainstream parties late last year, stormed out of an interim government in September demanding greater power-sharing.
The former rebels agreed to return after reaching the deal on the status of the 239-year-old monarchy. Its abolition had been one of their key demands.
King Gyanendra has already been stripped of most of his powers. He was forced to end 14 months of direct rule in April 2006 following mass street protests.
Gyanendra will remain on the throne for the time being as the deal between the Maoists and the government to make Nepal a republic can only be put into effect at the first meeting of a new constituent assembly.
Polls for that assembly are due to be held by mid-April.

The blast came amid large street protests by student unions and activists who oppose a meeting of an advisory council to King Gyanendra. The council is expected to call for greater powers for the king. 
Several thousand protesters swarmed through the streets of the ancient capital for a second day, shouting ""Down with the state council, down with the king! Long live the republic!""
Friday's blast, blamed by police on Maoists fighting to overthrow the monarchy, wrecked the ground floor of the state-run agricultural research plant at Lalitpur and injured four people.
It followed an explosion at a government building Thursday, also blamed on the rebels, that caused damage but no casualties. 
Last week two blasts shook the capital but hurt nobody. Those also were blamed on the Maoists who have been fighting since 1996 in a conflict that has claimed over 10,000 lives.
The Maoists, who control large parts of rural Nepal, plant bombs in Kathmandu as a warning that they can strike anywhere, observers say, but their blasts in the capital rarely cause casualties.
A local newspaper said at least 19 Maoists and four soldiers died in two clashes Thursday but this could not be immediately confirmed by the army. There have been almost daily battles between the Maoists and troops since a nine-day ceasefire in October for a Hindu holiday.
Opponents of the proposal to be considered by the king's council say giving Gyanendra more clout would violate the constitution restricting his role to a ceremonial one. The two-day meeting was due to end later Friday.
Supporters say the king needs more power to help crush the revolt since political parties are in too much disarray to suppress it.
The government has appealed to the rebels to resume negotiations after peace talks collapsed in 2003 due to discord over the king's role.
It has set a deadline of January 13 for the rebels to start negotiations, saying otherwise it will go ahead with elections in mid-April.
The Maoists say they will sabotage the polls. Instead, they want elections for a constituent assembly to draft a constitution that would abolish the monarchy.

"6461",20081203,"Title: Cloud of uncertainty over Everest season.rtf; Date: March 26, 2008 Wednesday 9:21 AM GMT; Text: Climbers hoping to scale Mount Everest are uncertain of being allowed near the peak this season, with the north side in Tibet closed and Nepal expected to also impose restrictions, mountaineers said Wednesday.
Fears that the world's highest peak may be closed off altogether come as China prepares to put the Olympic torch on the summit and seeks to avoid any embarrassing protests following a wave of unrest in Tibet.
Major expeditions planning to scale the summit from the north -- the route China will use to carry the torch to the roof of the world -- have already been cancelled after failing to secure permits from Beijing.
Furthermore, China has banned foreigners from Tibet until further notice following a wave of protests and rioting.
Authorities in Nepal, reportedly under pressure from China to keep the mountain clear from their side, are also holding back from issuing permits.
""We are very worried and confused as we have not yet received any concrete decision from the government,"" said expedition organiser Ishwori Poudel.
Officials in Kathmandu, the nerve centre of Himalayan climbing, said Nepal's government could still allow climbs from the south side of the peak -- albeit with a slew of restrictions that would satisfy China's concerns.
These include stipulating that no climber on the Nepal side of the peak be allowed anywhere near the summit between May 1-10 -- about the time when the Chinese torch team plans to make it to the top.
The problem is that the main Everest climbing season is in May, when a favourable change in weather conditions creates a window of opportunity of only two weeks or less.
""We don't want to see any anti-China protest on Everest when Chinese authorities are taking up the torch on top of Everest from their side,"" Nepal's Tourism Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung told AFP.
Nepal's foreign minister, Sahana Pradhan, confirmed her country was wary of upsetting its giant northern neighbour.
""The Olympic flame is very important for China and we know we have to do everything to help them have a successful Olympics,"" she said, adding the decision was in the interests of ""a good neighbourly relationship"" with Beijing.
Kathmandu appears to be hesitating over a decision on whether or not it will issue permits.
""Government officials at a cabinet meeting will make a decision on Everest, but nobody is certain when that meeting will take place,"" said expedition organiser Poudel, whose firm has 55 clients who have paid tens of thousands of dollars each and are awaiting news.
Time is quickly running out as tackling Everest requires weeks of preparation by Sherpas who have to lay hundreds of ladders across the Khumbu Icefall -- the dangerous maze of ice just above base camp -- as well as lay out kilometres of rope alone the route.
""Sherpas were sent to fix ladders and ropes on the route at the start of March, but tourism ministry officials have stopped them working, and we are still waiting to hear when we can start,"" Poudel added.

 In the wake of the ""blockade"" imposed by the rebel CPN Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the government is escorting convoys of essential goods and passengers, the Home Ministry said Wednesday 18 August afternoon.
 Spokesman at the Home Ministry Gopendra Bahadur Pandey told Nepalnews that the government had increased the mobility of security forces along the major highways and was making arrangements for other security forces.

""We are ready to add more security if the need be,"" he added. Mr Pandey said that there were no reports of any violence on the first day of the blockade so far.
 Some vehicles have started moving in and out of Thankot, the major entry point to Kathmandu, during the day along with the security escort provided by the government, reports said.
 Most of the private transport operators, however, opted off the roads taking precautions. Some vehicles entered Kathmandu from the east of capital, Kavre, in the morning carrying vegetables and milk.
 Two district units of Maoists and its affiliated organizations had jointly called for an indefinite blockade of Kathmandu beginning Wednesday.
 They have demanded a probe into the killing of their senior activists, Bharat Dhungana and Baikuntha Pokhrel, and that the guilty be punished.

About 1000 youths, many of them college students from different parts of the State, would be participating in the run to express their solidarity with the cause of `missing women'.
  The solidarity and awareness run is preceded by a series of road shows on issue of violence against women and gender equality being staged at different parts of the City on December 16 and 17.
  MP tops in rape and molestation
  Madhya Pradesh is one of the States where the perpetration of crimes against women is highest in the country. More shockingly, the State has earned the dubious distinction of recording the highest incidences of rape and molestation in the country.
  As much as 17.7 per cent of all rapes and 21 per cent of all molestations in the country took place in MP (in year 2002). It also contributes 9.9 per cent dowry deaths, 6.3 per cent of cases of cruelty by husbands and relatives, 4.4 pc of abductions and 7.7 pc cases of sexual harassment.
  The State ranks second in the country after younger sibling Chhattisgarh as far as the rate of total cognizable crimes against women goes, the crime figures (for the year 2002) of National Crime Bureau shows. It ranks third in the country on the basis of percentage share of crimes against women.
  The State contributes 10.3 per cent of crimes against women in country (behind Andhra Pradesh that contributes 12.8 per cent and Uttar Pradesh that contributes 10.6 per cent) and the rate of cognizable crimes here is 24.6 per cent (only behind Chhattisgarh with 24.6 per cent rate).
  Addressing a joint press conference, NGO representatives associated with the State level campaign said that the WE CAN campaign has been initiated by Oxfam International, a confederation of 12 organisations, in six countries in South Asia including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The objective is to `create a fundamental shift in women's and men's attitude, beliefs and behaviours that perpetuate gender-based violence in South Asia'.
  By year 2011, the WE CAN campaign hopes to reach and influence about five crore ordinary men and women across the six countries to oppose violence against women and adopt more gender-equal practices in their own lives.
  The campaign would target rural communities and urban and semi-urban youths in higher educational institutes so as to raise awareness about this issue. The youths would be targeted with a view to creating a generation, which is more sensitive to these important issues and thus create a shift of attitude in society in coming days.
  In MP, the campaign would be implemented by Sangini network of about 100 organisations and Samaan network of another 104 organisations of Bundelkhand region.
  The basic work done would be awareness campaign using kala jatthas and providing platform to the youths to discuss the issues and finally create sensitive groups of youths who can advocate the cause to the larger section of society.
  As a run up to the launch of the campaign, a talk show would also be held at Hindi Bhavan on December 17 at 3.00 pm, where discussions between groups of youth would be facilitated by an expert panel.
  Among those who addressed the press conference included Nidhi of Oxfam, Lucknow, Prarthana of Sangini Gender Resource Centre, Bhopal (representative of the state in the national level core implementation group), Kalpana Khare of Mahila Shakti Kendra, Mahoba (UP), Gayatri Devi Parmar of Mahila Samiti, Chhatarpur and Shashi Maurya, Oxfam consultant working in Bundelkhand region.

 The security forces were kept on extra alert during the last few days of Dashain and no soldier was given holidays for the festival. They were further alerted when the soldiers confiscated a large amount of explosives from a rented room in Lalitpur Kathmandu Valley .
 ""If we had failed to confiscate the 6 kg of explosives from a rented room in Patan, the same could have created a lot of casualties during festival,"" Royal Nepal Army Spokesperson Col Deepak Gurung said.
The Himalayan Times, Kathmandu, in English 7 Oct 03
The army team had recovered explosives, a home-made weapon and a few ""important"" documents from the apartment - which was rented by a few suspected rebels from Dhaukhel - in Patan on Friday 3 October . When queried if anyone were arrested from the spot, Col Gurung said, ""Few might have been detained for further investigation.""
 He, however, denied to be specific on the documents seized and the number of people arrested from the spot.
 ""There is the possibility of other such hidden cache of weapons and explosives in the valley and public vigilance is necessary to avoid the expected threat,"" added Col Gurung explaining further that the people should be extremely careful while renting their house.
 About 20 per cent of soldiers used to be given leave during festivals in previous years. ""Our soldiers have been murdered at their homes when they went on leave; we can't trust the armed rebels and did not take any chance by sending the soldiers on leave,"" said an other senior army official, who preferred anonymity.
 Citing the incident at Bhagkhor area of Dolkha district in central region where a soldier's body was found on Fulpati, 2 October (the seventh day of Dashain), he clarified, ""The rebels had declared unilateral cease-fire but considering the past history when Maoists (mis)used as published cease-fire for their own purposes, security forces had to be vigilant.""
 The Maoists had ambushed a patrol in which the murdered-soldier's father was also returning from the spot where the body was found. The rebels' attack triggered a crossfire that resulted in the death of a female Maoist on the same day.

He added that the committee will publish authentic travel information through periodic briefings to the media and the travelers.
Tourism is one of the major foreign currency earner for Nepal, which once earned about 170 million US dollar annually. However, tourists arrival declined sharply due to the anti-government guerrillas' insurgency in recent years.

Burdened by the unending cycle of reaping, winnowing, sowing and weeding, shall I ever have enough of leisure to taste kafals in the jungle while traversing the trail that leads to my mother's home?""
  So sang a Kumaoni bride ages back and trapped in the quagmire of hard life when she lost her life untimely, she became a Magpie, a beautiful bird who, when the Kafal ripens in Himalayan jungles in the month of May and June often sings, ""kafal pakko, meil ni chakkho"" (kafal has ripened but I couldn't taste it yet.)
  Known to the botanists as Myrica Nagi Kafal is an uncultivated fruit of the Central Himalayas. In tourists towns like Nainital villagers may be seen sitting at road sides selling it for any thing between Rs 60 to 100 per kg. However, in the interiors small kids off from their schools, may be generous enough to offer it to you at the rate of just Rs 5 for a glass tumbler full.
  Besides Kumaon Kaphal (or Katphala) trees are found in North Punjab, Garhwal, Khasiya mountain and Silhat up to 2100 metres and also in Nepal and China. Dr. Chiranjit Parmar, a Horticultural Consultant on Lesser Known Indian Plants, feels that this fruit has a potential of a new fruit crop.
  It therefore deserves domestication and may turn out to be a new commercial crop. Never cultivated and propagated by the department of forest Kafal trees with dioecious flowers (individual plants having only one sex of flowers) have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, which form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Much of this nitrogen is used by other plants growing nearby.
  Ayurveda speaks of it as vedanasthapaka - pain killer, sita prasamana - relieves cold sensation on the skin, samjna sthapana restores consciousness, kanthya - beneficial for the throat, sandhaniya - a healing herb and sukra sodhana - purifies seminal fluids. Susruta has mentioned it as visaghna - detoxifier and stambhana- astringent.
  Besides being useful in a wide range of ailments specified decoctions of its fruits, the stone they have and also its bark are claimed to be beneficial in cardiac debility, edema and haemoptysis.A wax covering on the fruit is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water.
  Among the local inhabitants it is said to be used as an application for ulcer healing. Candles made from this wax though are brittle but less greasy in warm weather and are quite aromatic and do not smoke when put out. Dr Prabhat Kumar from Pithoragarh, where it grows in abundance says that keeping an eye on its medicinal properties may become a ""much sought after souvenir from hills.""

Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 2 January: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is carrying out its first exhumation of a grave laid by Maoists in Dhangadhi on Wednesday.
A team comprising two forensic experts and two NHRC officers from Kathmandu reached the far western city of Dhangadhi [headquarters of Kailali District] on Tuesday to dig out the grave believed to be of one Chaman Singh Bam, an NHRC member told the [Kathmandu] Post.
The national human rights watchdog and Nepal Police have exhumed 12 graves - including one mass grave in Doramba, Ramechhap District [eastern Nepal]  - until now to unearth the status of people disappeared during the decade-long conflict and believed to be killed. But all the excavated graves were the ones allegedly laid by security forces to bury people who had been killed in custody.
Neither NHRC nor police had exhumed the graves of people allegedly killed by Maoists in the past, a move that gave rise to questions regarding the motive of the exhumation work carried out in the past.
According to the NHRC member, who preferred anonymity, Maoists had abducted Bam in May 2003 and he had disappeared, a charge refuted by Maoists when the NHRC inquired time and again. But NHRC found the grave believed to be that of Bam's with the help of locals some 70 km away from Dhangadhi. The locals found the grave after they traced the clothes that Bam wore. [passage omitted]

"3042",20044580,"Title: Nepalese rebels say Indian police have arrested six of their leaders.rtf; Date: June 3, 2004 Thursday; Text: Police in India have arrested six leaders of Nepal's Maoist rebel group, the guerrillas said Thursday. The detentions are a major boost for this Himalayan nation's government which has been struggling to contain the growing insurgency.
The six are members of the guerrillas' central committee, its highest decision-making body, said rebel leader Prachanda in a faxed statement.
""We condemn the arrests and urge the Indian police to immediately release them,"" said Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
The arrests are a major blow to the rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives. Fighting has escalated since the rebels withdrew from a cease-fire in August.
The central committee, which has about 45 members, decides on key guerrilla policy and plots insurgents tactics.
Indian police confirmed they had arrested an unspecified number of the rebel's central committee in eastern Bihar state on Wednesday.
Sen. Supt. Nayair Husnain Khan said the committee members were part of a group of nine men and a women detained in a series of raids on hotels in the state capital, Patna, after local authorities received a tip-off from the Indian federal Intelligence Bureau.
Communist literature, 150,000 rupees (US$ 3,300) and weapons were confiscated from the 11, he said.
Nepalese police officers were traveling to India to help identify the suspects, officials said.
In the past year, three committee members have been arrested in India. Two of them have been repatriated to Nepal, where they are in prison. The third is believed to remain in detention in India.
The arrests came a day before India's External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh is scheduled to travel to Nepal on his first foreign visit after taking over last month following India's national elections.
The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

 Kathmandu, 29 September: A plane of Vega Airlines, a private Bulgarian cargo company, carrying arms for Nepal police, landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Wednesday 29 September . TIA officials confirmed the arrival of the plane.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 30 Sep 04
Constance C. Jones, spokesperson of the US embassy in Kathmandu, confirmed the statement of the American embassy in New Delhi that the arms were meant for training Nepal police personnel. The US embassy in New Delhi, denying that it was a US plane, said the US State Department is training the Nepal police to develop anti-terrorist capabilities and that the plane was carrying equipment for this purpose.
 Jones told the Post that it was part of a regular training programme of the US government to train police forces around the world and denied it was meant for the army.
 The New Delhi statement said the plane carrying equipment for the Nepal police left Bulgaria on Tuesday, landed in India on Wednesday and was cleared to leave for Nepal, according to agency reports. However, the Indian daily The Hindu reported that the plane was detained at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, since Saturday before it was allowed to fly to Nepal.

"3722",2005767,"Title: Encephalitis Killing Children in Asia.rtf; Date: August 31, 2005 Wednesday; Text: A Japanese encephalitis outbreak that has killed more than 400 children in northern India and neighboring Nepal could have been avoided with a one-shot vaccination that is routinely used to prevent the disease in China.
The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, began last month and has left more than 1,000 hospitalized, while more children die each day. On Wednesday, Indian health officials said 41 children had died in the previous 24 hours, raising the monthlong death toll to 308.
Across the border in southern Nepal, the disease, which has no cure, has been spreading since April.
But in nearby China, a vaccine that has been proven effective in preventing the disease has yet to reach some of the most afflicted areas in Asia - delayed by a lack of money and competition from other diseases that are higher on priority lists, researchers said.
The Chinese vaccine, which is based on a weakened form of the virus, has not yet been placed on a list of pre-qualified vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, which also could be a potential deterrent for some countries awaiting the U.N. health agency's nod of approval.
The WHO's Joachim Hombach, however, said countries should not base their decisions solely on whether the vaccine is WHO-approved.
""If the product is not pre-qualified, it doesn't mean you cannot use it. It doesn't mean the product is bad,"" Hombach said in Geneva. ""It just means we have not seen it.""
No Japanese encephalitis vaccines have been pre-qualified by the WHO, he said, including a more expensive mouse brain vaccine used widely in the United States and Europe.
Though closely related to West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis isn't as widely known as other mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria or dengue fever. Still, it is the leading cause of viral encephalitis and neurological infection in Asia.
While underreported, about 50,000 cases of the disease are recorded each year, including 15,000 deaths, according to the WHO.
Japanese encephalitis typically targets the poor and the young - children between 1 and 15 who live near rice paddies in rural areas. Blinding headaches, seizures, nausea and high fever usually precede death. Up to 75 percent of survivors suffer a lifetime of disabilities, including paralysis and mental retardation.
Annual outbreaks occur throughout Asia, often after the monsoon rains. Like polio, only about 1 in 250 people infected ever develop symptoms, contributing to a high level of immunity among adults. The disease has also expanded, reaching northern Australia in the 1990s.
The vaccine has been widely used in China since 1988. Last year, about 200 deaths from the disease were reported nationwide, according to the Chinese Ministry of Health.
So far, only South Korea, Nepal and Sri Lanka have licensed the Chinese vaccine, but it is still not widely used in many places there. The other countries, including India, rely on limited supplies of the more expensive mouse brain vaccine.
Dr. Scott B. Halstead, an American who is the research director at the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative, conducted a study on the Chinese vaccine in 1999. The results showed that one injection was effective almost immediately, with no side effects.
""Let's say you're making an AIDS vaccine or TB - they're all in the 'God I wish I could do it category, but I don't know how,""' he said. ""Here with Japanese encephalitis, you've got a vaccine that really works. There's no need to sputter or procrastinate.""
The mouse brain vaccine causes more side effects, requires multiple doses and takes a month after the last dose to be effective, said Dr. Julie Jacobson, director of the Japanese Encephalitis Project at the U.S.-based nonprofit PATH.
In India, the latest outbreak has become so severe that doctors are using makeshift oxygen masks fashioned from cardboard cones and tubing after running out of the real things.
Dr. O.P. Singh, Uttar Pradesh state's director-general of health, said it would cost about $58 million to vaccinate more than 7 million children. The state's entire health budget is only $25 million.
Last week in the state capital of Lucknow, a rickshaw driver's 6-year-old son died in his father's arms, gasping for breath outside a government hospital. There were no beds and not enough doctors to help in the overcrowded facility.
""We can understand the anguish of a father. But what can we do?"" said Dr. Anurag Yadav, a physician at the hospital. ""We do not have space to admit any more children.""
It's stories like this that sadden Jacobson, who is working under a five-year, $27 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to raise awareness about Japanese encephalitis and push for countries like India to license and administer the Chinese vaccine.
One obstacle is convincing leaders that the traditional spraying of houses with mosquito repellant and using bed nets do little to prevent infections because the mosquitos"
"5948",20071062,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists set poll preconditions, not quitting gov't.rtf; Date: August 8, 2007 Wednesday 3:13 PM GMT; Text: The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which ended its 10-year violent insurgency by entering a peace process with seven mainstream political parties last year, concluded its fifth plenary session in Kathmandu on Wednesday after approving party Chairman Prachanda's preconditions for holding a Constituent Assembly election scheduled for Nov. 22.
The assembly is slated to write the country's new constitution.
Prachanda, however, refused to give in to pressure exerted by over 2,000 participants in the plenary session who demanded that the party leadership quit the coalition government and launch a fresh ""people's revolt,"" according to Ananta, deputy commander of the party's military wing. The plenary session had started last Friday.
In the party's Central Committee meeting last week, Prachanda had proposed that the party set to the government the declaration of a republic and a fully proportional election system as preconditions for holding the assembly polls.
Before setting these preconditions, the Maoists had agreed on a mixed election system -- partially first past-the-post and partially proportional -- and also that the first meeting of the elected assembly would decide the fate of the country's 238-year-old monarchy.
""The plenary session unanimously passed Prachanda's proposal,"" Ananta said.
However, Prachanda refused to ask his five ministers in the coalition government to quit the government, stating that the party would first seek a political consensus with seven other ruling parties on the two preconditions set by the Maoists, and then consider stepping out of the government and launching a ""people's revolt.""
According to Ananta, the Maoists have decided that holding the polls in November would be meaningless if these two preconditions are not met.
Nepal's Maoists waged a violent insurgency since 1996. The bloodshed cost the country over 13,000 lives by the time it formally ended in November 2006.
One of the Maoists' major demands was election to a Constituent Assembly to rewrite a new constitution, which, they believed in the past, would end the monarchical tradition in the country.
With the latest preconditions, they are hoping to put an end to the institution of monarchy through the interim parliament itself, in which they are the second largest party, after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's Nepali Congress party.
The Maoists are holding their Central Committee meeting in Kathmandu from Thursday to decide the nature of the ""people's revolt"" they might launch if their preconditions are not met.

"7155",20083213,"Title: NOTORIOUS NOIDA.rtf; Date: June 15, 2008 Sunday 5:50 PM  EST; Text: Noida, June 15 -- The Aarushi-Hemraj murder case may have catapulted NOIDA to national headlines, but its crime graph suggests that the law and order situation is fast receding into anarchy.
Be it murders, road hold-ups, thefts, dowry or rape, heinous crime is on a perpetual vertical climb.
While the number of murders registered in 2006 were 33 came down to 27 in 2007, in just five months of 2008 NOIDA has witnessed as many as 22 murders. Loots, dacoities and burglary are a regular in this part of the NCR. Though the number of such cases remained almost consistent till last year, this year it has gone up. There have been 42 burglaries and 22 chain snatchings since January 2008, as opposed to a zero incidence of such cases in 2006 and 2007.
Not just this, dowry deaths, too, have seen an unprecedented increase. While 2006 recorded three dowry deaths, 11 cases have been registered with NOIDA police since 2007.
Vehicle and other thefts, too, are at an all time high. As many as 225 vehicles were stolen in 2006 and 683 in 2007, while a sweeping 589 have gone missing in just five months this year.
That the cops, on the mat for growing lawlessness and investigation mess-ups, ill-equipped to deal with the situation is amply buttressed by the fact that since 2006 when the Nithari case broke, three SSPs, five SPs and seven SHOs from one police station have been unceremoniously transferred. Three SSPs -- RKS Rathore, Rajiv Sabharwal and the one axed for Aarushi case mess-up, Satish Ganesh, have been transferred for lousy investigations and inability to show results.
Former SP Paresh Pandey had spent in time in NOIDA for just seven months when he was transferred for unknown reasons. Rakesh Gautam joined as Pandey's replacement but was unceremoniously removed within 40 days.
After his exit Prabal Pratap Singh took charge as the new SP (City) but he too was transferred in just seven days. Next came Sadhna Goswami whose duties were terminated within three days ""in public interest"". The next in line Mahesh Mishra was also sent packing in 14 days.
The SHOs, too, were not allowed to spend time, ""owing to their inaction and gross political interference,"" a top cop said.
Though present Senior Suprintendent of Police R K Chaturwedi has taken quick remedial actions, one of them being setting up of servant verification cell, this initiative too is not without loopholes.
As per the verification form drafted by SP (City) Ashok Tripathi, guarantors of domestic helps would be verified.
The column says: ""I take guarantee of the verified help and I will be responsible for any misdeed committed by him or her."" Tripathi says it is an attempt to fix responsibility on the person who helps verify a help.
Naturally, the NOIDA Citizen's Forum is up in arms, saying this clause meant the cops are passing the buck entirely on employers.
""We don't think a relative will take full guarantee of a person. One cannot say if he or she will not do anything wrong in future. This clause might make verification difficult,"" a member said.
But Chaturwedi says this is an essential legal requirement. ""There are so many domestic helps who are from Nepal or Bangladesh. You cannot expect complete verification in such cases.
""So, we want that a person wanting to work in NOIDA should have a local guarantor,"" he said.

 Text of report by Indian Doordarshan DDTV news channel on 30 April; words within double quotation marks in the recorded segments are in English]
 In Nepal, King Gyanendra has lifted the emergency, which was imposed on 1 February 2005. A Royal Palace notice said the state of emergency was lifted effective Friday midnight. And the announcement came hours after the king returned home from his official visit to China, Indonesia, and Singapore. And the king had imposed the emergency after dismissing the Sher Bahadur Deuba government and suspended fundamental rights and press freedom. And the lifting of the emergency came after the Nepal king's statement yesterday that he has taken the suggestions by the Indian prime minister seriously on restoration of democracy in Nepal. Speaking to media in Kathmandu after his nine-day foreign visit, King Gyanendra said he was impressed by the statesmanship shown by Dr Singh.
Doordarshan DDTV news channel, New Delhi, in English 09:00 GMT, 30 Apr 05
[Unidentified correspondent] King Gyanendra had met Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh at Jakarta on the sidelines of the Afro-Asian summit. It appears that the king took the suggestions given by Dr Singh seriously on restoration of democracy in Nepal. On his return after a nine-day foreign trip, King Gyanendra said that he was impressed by the statesmanship shown by Dr Singh. The announcement of lifting of the emergency came hours after the king's return. Nepal's political leaders, however, are not too excited with the king's decision.
 [Rajendra Mahato of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, in Hindi] This mere lifting of the emergency is nothing in itself. This is so because hundreds of workers and leaders are still in jail there, arrests are still continuing, the royal commission is still being strengthened, vindictive actions are being taken, ""censorship"" still continues, and the political parties cannot carry on their activities there. In this situation, it will be totally wrong to say that the mere lifting of the ""emergency"" will lead to the ""restoration"" of ""democracy"".
 [Shekhar Koirala, leader of Nepal Congress, in Hindi] There has been so much ""international"" and ""national pressure"" on the king as he could not ""stand"" it and he has lifted the emergency. Another thing is that in every country that he visited, he has been begging, asking for ""arms"" and ""military assistance"". So, all of those countries have given a categorical answer that so long as he [the king] does not ""restore"" ""democracy"", they will not provide ""military assistance"" to him.
 [Correspondent] Constitutionally, the three-month state of emergency granting the military extra powers of search, arrests, and curfew had to end or be formally extended by midnight on Sunday. It is notable that King Gyanendra's announcements made no mention of him giving up most of the extra powers assumed when he sacked the government, suspended democracy, and took control himself on 1 February in a bid to end a long-running Maoist rebellion. In his proclamation, Gyanendra said he would continue the newly established Royal Commission for Corruption Control set up after 1 February with sweeping powers to arrest, investigate, and prosecute politicians and bureaucrats.
 Bureau report, DD News.
 And New Delhi has welcomed the lifting of the emergency as a first step towards beginning of a new political process. India has also called for the release of all political leaders still in custody and the restoration of civil liberties.

"6415",20072914,"Title: Nepal 's former rebels agree to rejoin government; Monarchy to be abolished.rtf; Date: December 24, 2007 Monday 3:32 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's former insurgents will rejoin the government to end a political stalemate that has stalled crucial elections, but they have yet to decide when, an ex-rebel leader said Monday.
The ex-rebels a communist faction usually referred to as the Maoists signed an agreement Sunday with the leaders of Nepal's six other main political parties to return to the government and abolish the monarchy.
Chandra Prakash Gajurel, a senior Maoist leader, said the questions of when to rejoin and who would get ministerial jobs will be discussed at a party central committee meeting soon.
The Maoists quit the government in September, demanding the immediate abolition of the monarchy and changes to the election system.
The 23-point pact said the leaders also agreed that once a Constituent Assembly is elected by mid-April, its first meeting would declare Nepal a republic, ending its centuries-old monarchy a move that has been widely expected for months.
The Constituent Assembly will rewrite Nepal's constitution and hammer out the details of a new political structure for the country.
""The agreement clears the way for the election,"" Gajurel said, confirming that the Maoists would also take part.
The parties agreed that voters will directly elect 240 members of the assembly, while 335 other candidates will get seats under a proportional representation system, with parties receiving seats in proportion to the number of votes they win.
When the Maoists quit the government three months ago, other parties in the coalition government refused to abolish the monarchy immediately, saying the assembly should be allowed to decide on the issue as had been agreed in a peace agreement signed with the then-rebels last year.
The Maoists began their armed insurgency in 1996. It left at least 13,000 people dead in 10 years of fighting government troops.
The rebels formed links with the main political parties last year, joining pro-democracy street protests that forced King Gyanendra to give up direct rule.
The Maoists later declared a cease-fire, signed a peace agreement and confined their combatants and weapons to United Nations-monitored camps. They joined Nepal's parliament in January and the government in April this year.

"3979",2005599,"Title: King's role should only be ceremonial_ Koirala.rtf; Date: June 14, 2005 Tuesday 12:39 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, June 14 -- VETERAN NEPALI politician and former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's prescription for a return to full-fledged democracy in Nepal differs slightly from India's formulation. He envisages a purely ceremonial role for the King in Nepal.
  New Delhi has consistently championed the cause of a constitutional monarchy as one of two key pillars of the Nepalese polity.
  Koirala's formulation, articulated on Tuesday, appeared closer to the Maoist demand for a republican state. He appeared eager to establish communications with the Maoist insurgents and has been advised by the Indian government to bring about a political solution to the problem, including initiating dialogue with the Maoists.
  Refusing to speak of the Indian government's decision to resume arms supplies to the Royal Nepal Army, he said he did not want to ""embarrass the Indian government on Indian soil."" He would ""not interfere in its policies"", but would increase the levels of political agitation to allow for greater international support to the cause of democracy.
  Addressing a press conference a day before his return to Kathmandu, a frail-looking Koirala laid out a 'road map for full-fledged democracy and permanent peace' in Nepal. Outlining the immediate demands of the seven party alliance of Nepalese political parties, which he heads, Koirala threatened an ""intensification"" of the political agitation after his return and was confident his ""last fight"" would be the victory of people and democracy over the monarch.
  Thanking the monarch for bringing all sections of civil society against ""dictatorial rule"", Koirala seemed confident of victory in the current struggle for restoration of democracy, that he called a ""fight between modernity and feudalism"".
  The political charter of demands, largely supported by India, include, sequentially, the immediate reinstatement of Parliament, which would ""reactivate the Constitution"" and allow the formation of an all-party coalition government.
  Once this ""constitutional body"" is in place, it would initiate contacts with the Maoists and bring them into the political fold. After which elections could be held to the Constituent Assembly, Koirala said.
  During his ten days in New Delhi, ostensibly for medical treatment, Koirala met a wide cross-section of the Indian leadership, including Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Natwar Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and leaders from the Left parties and senior officials.

    ""The suspension of offensive from our side is for an indefinite period of time, so that the rebels would convert their suspension  of offensive into a ceasefire and genuinely come to the  negotiating table for the peaceful settlement of the nine-year- long insurgency,"" spokesman Mohammad Mohsin said.
    The government's announcement comes three days after the  guerrillas announced to suspend all armed operations during  Dashain festival, the greatest festival in the Hinduist kingdom.
    However, Mohsin added, ""There will be no attacks from our side  doesn't mean we will keep mum if they (rebels) attack or try to  disturb the law and order situation of the country.""
    The government forces will be on high alert across the kingdom  so that the people will be able to celebrate the festival without  fear, he noted.
    Talking to mediapersons on Monday evening, Nepali Prime  Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called on the guerrillas to take the  ceasefire as an opportune moment for peace talks.
    ""The general election process will begin in March next year,""  Deuba said, adding, ""The country needs peace first.""
    More than 10,000 Nepalese people have lost their lives since  the anti-government insurgency broke out in the Himalayan kingdom  in early 1996.

In a joint press release made available to media in Kathmandu on Tuesday, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Communist Party of India (Maoist) denounced what they see as efforts by the United States to suppress the Maoist movements in the two countries ""and other countries of South Asia.""
The e-mailed press release was signed by Azad for the Indian Maoists and Satya for the Nepalese Maoists. Both appear to be pseudonyms.
It said: ""As part of their direct intervention in Nepal, the U.S. officers have themselves been training the Royal Nepalese Army and even entering every sphere of society to subvert the ongoing anti-monarchical movement.""
In India, U.S. diplomats have been ""openly visiting"" the northern state of Chhatisgargh and the military-run jungle warfare camp as part of their plan to suppress the Maoists, the press release said.
After fighting a decade-long insurgency, Nepalese Maoists are now engaged in a fragile peace process with the government, while in India the Maoists, or Naxalites, remain involved in hit-and-run attacks on government personnel and installations.
The Indian Maoists are also building what is known as the ""Red Corridor"" across the country, an area in which they exert their influence.
The joint press release also said the Maoist parties of Nepal and India ""also strongly condemn the blatant aggression on Lebanon and call for the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli troops and an end to the bombing of civilian targets by the Zionists.""
The two parties occasionally issue a joint statement pledging to work together against external interference.

The only vehicles to take the street belonged to emergency services, while schools and universities were closed and all stores barring pharmacies remained shuttered, they said.
The country's five main political parties have banded together to launch a programme of action aimed at pressuring King Gyanendra to reverse his decision to sack the elected government in 2002.
The king had accused the squabbling political parties of widespread failures, particularly in not quashing a rebellion by Maoists that has claimed more than 9,500 lives since 1996.
In a bid to defuse the crisis, the king's handpicked prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa stepped down earlier this month. Gyanendra accepted his resignation and said he was seeking a replacement with a ""clean image"" to help rebuild the violence-torn Himalayan kingdom.
Since April 1, the parties' programme has taken the form of daily demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands onto the capital's streets -- action the parties have vowed to continue until the king meets their demands.
They called this two-day strike to test the ""people's response to the five-party political agitation against the regressive actions of King Gyanendra"", Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun Narsingh K.C. told AFP.
""In the past, we avoided frequent strike calls in view of the adverse impact it would have on the people's lives, particularly those in the low income bracket, but this time we called a general strike as we have to know the people's response,"" he said.
The spokesman claimed outlying areas of the capital had also been affected by the strike. Police said no incidents had been reported so far.
The leaders of the two largest parties in the dissolved parliament, Girija Prasad Koirala and Madhav Kumar Nepal, declined invitations for separate meetings Monday at Narayanhiti Palace, saying all parties should be involved in negotiations.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 8 April
Kathmandu, 7 April: Home Minister Kamal Thapa has claimed that the general strike called by the seven-party alliance is beyond the control of the organizers. ""Although the agitation was announced by the seven parties, its reins are at the hands of Maoist rebels,"" he said at a press conference organized at the Home Ministry Friday [7 April]. ""New faces are seen among the demonstrators in the streets. They are not cadres of political parties.""
Claiming that the first two days of the general strike were violent, he said: ""A lot of destructive activities have taken place. One cannot classify activities such as burning documents in government offices, vandalism and brutally beating up security personnel under the definition of peaceful demonstration.""
Stating that no untoward incident took place in the first two days of the general strike due to the restraint exercised by security personnel, Home Minister Thapa accused demonstrators of forcing the government to use force. ""Terrorists are trying to force the government to open fire by carrying out violent activities in an orchestrated manner. But the government is exercising restraint because of the participation of the political parties [in the demonstrations].""
Charging that the general strike is an orchestrated conspiracy to topple the state by instigating a rebellion by the people through sheer violence and terror, Thapa alleged that the seven parties were being used for that purpose. Home Minister Thapa said that although the rebels have not formally extended assistance and support to the general strike, the government could treat the seven parties and the Maoists in the same way. He claimed that preparations were under way to extend the general strike beyond 9 April and also to impose blockades.
He pointed out the need for unity among constitutional forces. ""Parties would do well to stop hoping that the terrorists will bring democracy for them and then they will be able to come to power."" Revealing that the government was using the minimum possible force to keep the agitation of the seven-party alliance under control, he warned that it won't hesitate to explore other options to keep the security situation intact. [passage omitted] 
Some 751 political leaders and cadres have been arrested in the course of the general strike. Among them, 393 have been released, said Home Minister Thapa. Two hundred and fifty-three [253] people are being detained under the  investigation. Out of them, 115 have been given detention warrants, said Thapa.

Authorities imposed a curfew around Jhapa district after a protester was killed in Khekha town on Sunday when police opened fire on a group of activists trying to enforce a general strike by attacking buses. Jhapa is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital, Katmandu.
The chief government administrator in the area, Jayamukunda Khanal, said the key east-west highway had also been shut down by the curfew but convoys of buses and trucks escorted by armed policemen were allowed to cross through the area.
Khanal said general strikes called by several ethnic rights groups had also shut down neighboring districts.
In the southeastern town of Rajbiraj, three small bombs exploded overnight but did not harm anyone or leave any major damage, said government official Himnath Dawadi. Police are investigating but have no suspects, he said.
The curfew and general strikes have left passengers stranded, schools and markets closed and crippled life in the area.
Ethnic rights groups regularly call general strikes to push their demand for greater rights.
Many southerners say the area has been sidelined in favor of Nepal's more populated, mountainous north. They are demanding greater autonomy, more seats in the national legislature, and a guaranteed number of representatives in the administration.
Violence in the region has killed at least 70 people this year.

""My hope is and my cautious expectation is that the US will in the future recognise the authenticity and the non-terrorist nature of the commitment of the Maoists,"" the ex-Democratic president told journalists in Kathmandu.
His comments came after early results showed the Maoists taking an unexpected lead in the landmark elections held to elect a body that is expected to abolish Nepal's monarchy as well as write a new constitution. 
The Maoists are still classed by Washington as ""terrorists"" even though they signed a peace deal with mainstream parties in late 2006 ending a 10-year insurgency and joined mainstream politics, declaring they were ready to embrace democracy.
Carter was in Kathmandu where his human rights organisation helped monitor the polls, whose full results will not be known for at least a week.
""It was a serious mistake for the United States to continue to boycott... consultations and communications with the Maoists,"" Carter said, urging the United States to recognise the peaceful nature of the election.

She had reached Achham far-west Nepal to conduct research on the condition of conflict-affected women of the area for her Master's Degree thesis. She had been filming the folk life of the local people. She was rescued by Kantipur reporter J. Pandey and brought back into contact with her family.
 Four days after they reached the district, the two journalists were asked by the Maoist government chief Sarad, through a letter, to come to the rebel headquarters at Bhatkatiya.

 Kathmandu, 13 July : Close on the heels of the demotion of Kathmandu Valley from UNESCO world heritage sites, a former ambassador to UNESCO today warned that the culturally and architecturally rich valley would face a worse fate next year if measures to limit damage to the sites are not enforced.
 ""Damage control measures are needed to enforce to protect the sites from possible withdrawal in July 2004 when the next meeting of the World Heritage Committee will take place and decide the fate of the Kathmandu Valley,"" warned Dr Keshav Raj Jha, former Nepalese ambassador to the UNESCO.

 UNESCO originally had intended to review the situation in 2004, but did so this year after Nepal was seen as not making enough efforts to protect the sites. passage omitted

Police had already commandeered 30 microbuses and 15 Tata mobile pick-ups and put them on stand by at the No 2 police battalion at Maharajgunj by afternoon. The vehicles were returned in the evening.
The government had ordered the security forces to arrest the political leaders as they did to foil the party's' general strike in January. It has asked the army, Armed Police Force, Nepal Police and the National Investigation Department to stay alert, according to the police.

"710",20032583,"Title: Maoist leader in Nepal comes out of hiding.rtf; Date: March 28, 2003 Friday; Text: One of Nepal's top Maoist leaders, who has been in hiding for seven years, arrived in Kathmandu Friday, party sources said.
Babu Ram Bhattarai is the leader of the rebels' five-member negotiating team for peace talks with the government.
The Maoists and the government declared a ceasefire on January 29 and said they were willing to hold talks.
A date has not yet been fixed, but Bhattarai's arrival has raised hopes that negotiations could begin soon after King Gyanendra returns from a visit to India on Sunday.
Home Minister Dharma Bahadur Thapa said Friday the government was making efforts to start the talks soon.
""There is will be no deception from the government's side and the talks will be held sincerely for peace to prevail in the country,"" he said at a public meeting.
Bhattarai went into hiding in February 1996 after the Maoists launched their ""people's war"" for a communist republic. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.
Bhattarai was accompanied by Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, the head of the People's Liberation Army of the Maoist party, and another senior rebel leader.
The party source said they travelled in a private bus to the capital from the town of Butwal, 390 kilometres (242 miles) west of Kathmandu.
Soon after their arrival, they held meetings with Maoist leaders already in Kathmandu to discuss the proposed talks.

"6441",20072812,"Title: Nepal to set up commission to find information on hundreds who disappeared during conflict.rtf; Date: June 22, 2007 Friday 5:26 AM GMT; Text: Nepal will set up a high level commission to investigate what happened to hundreds of people who disappeared during a decade-long communist rebellion, a senior government minister said on Friday.
The makeup of the panel has not yet been decided, although it will be led by a former Supreme Court chief judge, Minister for Peace and Reconstruction Ram Chandra Poudel said.
""We are still consulting on the names of the people who will be in this high-level commission,"" Poudel told The Associated Press.
Poudel said the commission would investigate the fate of hundreds who were either detained by security forces or abducted by communist rebels during years of fighting in the Himalayan nation and never heard from again.
Maoist rebels gave up their armed revolt last year and joined a peace process to end the decade-long insurgency.
At the height of the fighting from 2001 to early 2006, hundreds of people were detained by the army and many disappeared while they were being held. Emergency laws had allowed for soldiers to pick up suspects and hold them without charge.
The rebels also took captive those who opposed them or were suspected of spying for the government.
The government has been under pressure to reveal what happened to those who disappeared. Earlier this week, about 200 people barricaded the prime minister's house demanding the government do more to find out what happened to their missing family members.
The interim government, which took control in April 2006, has repeatedly said it will investigate the alleged disappearances but has yet to take decisive steps in that direction.
On June 1, Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to investigate the ""large number of enforced disappearance cases.""
Last week, Human Rights Watch urged the government to ""quickly implement"" the Supreme Court's order and set up an inquiry to probe the disappearances.
The New York-based rights group said Nepal's new government has promised to find the truth and ensure justice for disappearances but has been slow to make good on these pledges.
Estimates of the number of people who disappeared vary and the government has not given any figure, but rights groups have said it is in the hundreds.

"4868",20065300,"Title: Nepal holds its first vote in seven years amid rebel threats and opposition boycott.rtf; Date: February 8, 2006 Wednesday 2:55 AM GMT; Text: Nepal held its first elections in seven years Wednesday, with the king squaring off against communist rebels and dissidents who hoped to disrupt the polls and the government threatening to shoot anyone caught doing so.
The municipal elections, billed as a step back toward democracy, were intended by the Nepal's absolute king to quell the long-running power struggle among the monarchy, political parties and Maoist rebels. Instead, they have exacerbated it, with rebel attacks and wildcat protests becoming near-daily occurrences.
As polls opened Wednesday at 8:15 a.m. (0215 GMT) Wednesday, there were only a few voters at a polling station at the Royal Nepal Academy in a densely populated area of central Katmandu.
Other stations were reported to be just as empty, with dozens of soldiers guarding each one and electoral officials waiting behind rusty, green ballot boxes.
""I'm not afraid because I'm voting for peace in the country,"" said Arun Basnet, 51, one of the first two people casting ballots at the academy.
He said he was voting for a pro-king mayoral candidate and attributed the lack of voters at the start of polling to ""confusion"" about were to cast ballots.
But opposition leaders, Western diplomats and even some government officials have said they expected a low turnout because of rebel threats and a boycott by the major political parties, which call the elections a sham to legitimize King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power last year.
The insurgents have threatened to kill anyone who takes part in the vote two candidates have already been slain prompting the government to take out life insurance policies worth up to Nepal rupees 700,000 (US$10,300, euro8,650) for the more than 2,000 candidates.
The leading opposition parties plan to peacefully disrupt the vote, the first since 1999.
""We have instructed all our supporters and cadres to go the polling stations in their areas and do whatever they can to stop voting,"" Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress said Tuesday.
Gyanendra's government has responded by rounding up hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists.
Candidates have registered in less than half of the more than 4,000 races for mayors and local officials nationwide. Among those brave enough to run is a gang leader vying for mayor in the eastern town of Bidur and a street sweeper contending for the top job in the central city of Pokhara.
Votes were taking place in only 36 towns and cities because in the country's remaining 22 municipalities there were no candidates or contenders ran unopposed, Home Minister Kamal Thapa said.
It remained unclear how many of the 1.5 million registered voters would actually get to the 1,040 polling stations after the government ordered all vehicles off the roads, fearing rebel attacks. But officials said tens of thousands of government workers were ordered to vote.
Thapa told reporters that soldiers and police have also ""been instructed to use ultimate force if there are any attempts to disrupt the polls or harm the voters.""
Despite stepped up security, rebels bombed several government buildings in an east Nepal town early Wednesday. A day earlier, rebels killed seven police officers and soldiers in two attacks, one just east of Katmandu, the other far to the southeast. A rebel also was killed.
The Maoists also have called a nationwide strike this week.
The king seized power Feb. 1, 2005, claiming the move was necessary to defeat the Maoists, whose decade-long fight for a communist state has cost 12,000 lives.
But fighting has persisted in this Himalayan land of 27 million people, and the economy has only worsened per capita income is less than US$25 a month.
The insurgency and the near-constant back-and-forth between the king and political parties ""has made it very difficult for us have interest in this election,"" said shopkeeper Saroj Jyoti, echoing a common sentiment in Katmandu. ""What changes?""

He is expected to move to a former hunting lodge on the outskirts of Kathmandu, with his palace in the heart of the city set to be turned into a museum.
""The (former) king will leave the palace on Wednesday, and before leaving he will hold a press conference,"" Phanindra Raj Pathak, the chief of the palace press secretariat told AFP Tuesday.
Nepal's monarchy was abolished on May 28 by the constitutional assembly, which was set up following a peace deal between Maoist insurgents and mainstream political parties.
The Maoists, who have told the king to bow out gracefully or else be put on trial, welcomed the news.
""It's a very positive step that the king has peacefully accepted the decision to vacate the palace. We are thankful to him,"" Krishna Bahadur Mahara, spokesman for the former rebels, told AFP.
""It has started a new era for peaceful political transition, and we honour his decision to live as a common citizen.""
The precise time of the former king's press conference has yet to be decided the palace official said, adding that it would probably be Wednesday evening.
Earlier this week, officials who were conducting an audit of palace property complained that the ex-monarch had failed to hand over the country's jewel-encrusted crown, but the palace official said the national treasure would be handed over before Gyanendra leaves Wednesday.  
""Of course he will hand over the crown before leaving,"" said Pathak, the palace press official.
""How can he take away the crown and sceptre when he is peacefully exiting the palace and giving up all of his royal privileges?""
The ex-monarch has been granted temporary permission to stay in a palace in Nagarjun, close to the capital, and the government of the newly republican country will continue to provide security, a home ministry spokesman said.
""The former king and queen will have 75 security personnel based in Nagarjun palace for their protection, fifty from the armed police and 25 from the army,"" Modraj Dottel, home ministry spokesman told AFP.
""We will give him extra security to escort him to his new residence on Wednesday if he requests it,"" said Dottel.
Gyanendra ascended the throne in June 2001 after a palace massacre in which the then crown prince -- who was drunk and on drugs and furious at being prevented from marrying the woman he loved -- killed most of the family and himself.
Gyanendra went on to sack the government and take direct control of the impoverished Himalayan nation, claiming the move was needed because politicians were inept and corrupt and had failed to tackle a Maoist insurgency.
The move pushed the mainstream parties and rebels into an alliance that led to a peace deal in late 2006 and the abolition of the monarchy last month.

"915",20032854,"Title: UN takes over from French -led force in Congo troublespot.rtf; Date: August 31, 2003 Sunday; Text: The French-led peacekeeping force in the troubled Ituri province of the Democratic Republic of Congo handed over control of its last post to the United Nations Sunday as fresh fighting was reported.
The handover occurred a day before the UN was due to officially take charge of peacekeeping operations on Monday to impose order on a region where 50,000 people have been killed in ethnic violence since 1999.
The UN force, called the Ituri Brigade, will operate under a wider mandate than the French-led European force, who were restricted to Bunia and to firing in self-defence.
The UN soldiers are permitted to engage hostile forces before being fired on and to operate throughout Ituri.
The new UN units went on the alert Saturday when renewed violence erupted.
A UN spokesman said fighting had broken out between The Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) -- the dominant armed group in the region from the minority Hema community -- and militia from the majority Lendu ethnic group, around Fataki, north of the provincial capital Bunia in Ituri, northeastern DRC.
""Two helicopters with the Ituri Brigade went on a reconnaissance mission over the Fataki and Bule areas Saturday,"" spokesman Leo Salmeron told journalists.
The Fataki region is under the control of the UPC, which is also dominant in Bunia, although its power has been considerably reduced since the deployment of the French-led peacekeeping force in June.
The new fighting appeared to have occurred Friday and Saturday.
""We can confirm that Fataki was completely deserted and destroyed and the central market and private dwellings suffered considerable destruction,"" the spokesman said. The situation appeared normal at Bule.
Asked if the Ituri Brigade would intervene, he said it would ""intervene in the very near future in Fataki"".
A humanitarian mission would go to the area in the coming week.
Meanwhile Colonel Gerard Dubois, spokesman for the French-led European Union force, told reporters: ""We have just transferred the last post held by the multinational force to the Ituri Brigade.""
A platoon of 58 Bangladeshi UN soldiers took over the post on a road between Bunia and the airport, relieving a French contingent.
The official handover was set for Monday after a two-week transition that started on August 16.
The EU force, mostly French and called ""Artemis"", was deployed to protect civilians after inter-ethnic clashes in Bunia.
UN peacekeepers in the region at the time were not only outnumbered but also not mandated to open fire to try to quell the violence.
The new UN force will be allowed to open fire and will have more firepower at its disposal, including the use of attack helicopters.
Some 2,400 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Uruguay, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Indonesia are already in Bunia, according to a military spokesman.
A Nepalese contingent will bring the total to around 4,000 from October.
The local population is anxious that the deployment of the stronger UN force will prevent a situation like that in May, when Bunia suffered intense fighting between rival militia, despite the deployment of 700 Uruguayan troops.
Ethnic violence between the majority Lendus and the minority Hema tribe in the region has claimed the lives of 50,000 people since 1999 and displaced half a million.

 The three-day Regional Conference on Poverty Reduction Strategies brings together delegates from Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, East Timor and Vietnam and observers from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka.
The forum, sponsored by development agencies that include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund, the U.N. Development Program and the World Bank, will focus on three major themes -- governance, 'pro-poor' growth, and the challenges of linking specific development goals with strategies that are seen as key factors in Asia's fight against poverty.
 The conference centers on sharing country experience with poverty reduction.
 In an opening address, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told participants his government sees the war on poverty as 'not just a policy, but a passion.'
 'We still have a long way to go and will encounter countless obstacles. We all must recognize that we cannot solve all the issues of poverty in one day or one month or one year,' he said.
 Cambodia is among the world's poorest countries, with about 30% of its 13 million people earning less than $1 a day.
 And with a population of 1.8 billion, East Asia and the Pacific is one of the world's largest developing regions where in 2000 about 261 million people lived on less than $1 a day.
 But the ADB expects regional development initiatives will reduce that number to about 80 million by 2015.

Kathmandu, [Friday] 18 July: Soon after it started a crackdown on ""rebelling"" police personnel on disciplinary grounds, the Home Ministry has initiated works to address genuine grievances raised by lower-rung police personnel. 
Sources at the Home Ministry said they have written to both Nepal Police and Armed Police Force (APF) personnel to develop a special mechanism in all units that would allow police personnel to lodge grievances. 
""The mechanism will facilitate junior police personnel to file their complaints and also help address their concerns immediately,"" said a source at the ministry. 
The source added that a ministerial-level decision has also directed both police forces to suggest necessary measures to ensure proper management of ration facilities and to make the tender process on ration facilities transparent. The ministry has also sought suggestions on ways to address concerns raised by rebelling police personnel about low-quality food. 
The move comes after APF and Nepal Police personnel recently resorted to rebellion in Parbat, and also APF Bageshwari Battalion and Riot Control Battalion of Nepal Police in Nepalgunj, alleging ""ill-treatment"", ""discrimination"" and low-quality food. The Home Ministry has started legal action against all those involved in rebellion on disciplinary grounds. 
The ministry has also directed both police organizations to investigate shortcomings that led police personnel to resort to rebellion and suggest to the Home Ministry necessary changes. 
""We will act as per their proposals,"" the source said. ""We will also see what kinds of changes both organizations bring in their internal management."" 
Meanwhile, Nepal Police on Thursday formed a three-member board headed by AIGP [Assistant Inspector-General of Police] Dipak Singh Thangden, chief of Administration Department at Police Headquarters, to investigate grievances of junior police personnel. The board includes DIGP [Deputy Inspector-General of Police] Ramesh Chanda Thakuri, chief of Training Directorate, and Human Rights Unit Chief SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] Binod Singh.

The state government is endeavouring to create make shift shelters for the people who have lost their houses in the devastating floods.
Many voluntary groups have also come forward to mitigate the miseries of the victims and provide them food.
Dinesh Chandra Yadav, Industry Minister of Bihar, who has been overseeing the setting relief camp in Saharsa district, said that the government is making every effort to provide relief to the flood victims.
""Every one should understand that in a relief camp one couldn't get the comforts of home. However, our efforts are to ensure that no flood victim dies from hunger, diseases or faces dearth of (drinking) water,"" said Yadav.
The flooding, said to be the worst in 50 years, was caused after an embankment of the Kosi River was breached in Nepal, from where it originates. This unleashed huge waves of water which smashed mud embankments downstream in Bihar.
The waters of the Kosi gushed into the state, inundating vast tracts and affecting around two million people.

 Prachanda, chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), said he has recently reached an understanding with seven major political parties to end the insurgency.
He said the rebels and the parties have agreed to jointly launch a struggle against King Gyanendra who took over direct rule of the country in February this year.
 Issuing a 12-point agreement reached with the parties, Prachanda said the two sides have also agreed to do away with the country's autocratic monarchy and establish 'complete democracy' in the Himalayan kingdom.
 The rebels and the political parties have agreed to elect a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution for the country, Prachanda said.
 The constitution would replace the current one, which the rebels believe gives military powers to the Nepalese monarch.
 The rebels' Peoples' Liberation Army and the Royal Nepalese Army would be placed under the supervision of the United Nations in the course of an election to form the constituent assembly, he said.
 They have also agreed to jointly work to render unsuccessful the municipal elections planned by the royal government for February 2006, he said.
 He also added that both the rebels and the political parties have pledged to maintain good and friendly relations with Nepal's neighbors China and India.
 The two sides have appealed to the international community for help in their bid to abolish autocratic monarchy in the country, the rebel leader said.
 The rebels took up arms against the government to replace the Nepalese monarchy with a people's republic.
 More than 13,000 Nepalese have been killed since the outbreak of the communist insurgency in February 1996, according to government figures.

The military said there were no confirmed casualties in the fighting in Mauriya, Dadeldhura district, where 'terrorists' had extorted money and food from villagers.
""The two sides clashed after the security forces overpowered the terrorists' sentry post in Mauriya area, and after two hours' clashes they (the rebels) fled the scene,"" the army headquarters said in a statement.
The army also said the rebels had entered a village school and ""used the school children as human shields"".
""The security forces did not suffer any damage (and) while it is believed that terrorists might have suffered some casualties, it could not be confirmed,"" the army statement said.
The security forces reported they had recovered crudely made explosives from the leftist rebels.
The clash was the first armed confrontation between the Maoist rebels and security forces in far-western Nepal since the ceasefire broke down Monday.
Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Pranchanda called off the four-month-old truce in a statement Monday, blaming continued military action by the army.
He said the rebels would resume hostilities against government forces but not target civilians, a move welcomed by human rights organization.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
Nepal's home ministry said Wednesday that security personnel had been directed to carry out search and security checks to maintain law and order, state media reported.
The move followed recent explosions outside the Kathmandu Valley and ""the confiscation of arms and ammunition hidden at public places in Kathmandu a few days ago,"" state-run news agency RSS said.

Text of unattributed report headlined ""Nepal Maoist chief starts consultations with Terai leaders"" published by Nepalese newspaper Nepal Samacharpatra on 10 July
Kathmandu, 9 July: After the presence of his party remained negligible in the terai [southern plains] districts, Maoist chairman Prachanda has started consultations with workers and leaders of the terai plains.
Chairman Prachanda and senior leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai started consultations with the terai workers and leaders in the capital after different armed groups in the terai region unleashed their attacks on the Maoist leaders and workers. Madhesi People's Rights Forum, three different factions of the Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha [rebel group] and other armed groups active in the terai plains have targeted the Maoists.
Party workers from the terai region have warned that the Maoist presence in the plains would be nil unless strong efforts are made to expand party organization in the region, said a leader participating in the meeting.
Activists of the Young Communist League [Maoist youth wing], who were assigned to carry out development works as per the wishes of the people, have started to flee the terai region due to a feeling of insecurity. Following this, the central leadership started the consultation initiative. There are reports that the Maoist organization in the terai has weakened after the Madhesi Liberation Front [a regional wing of the Maoists] stood on the verge of a split following internal differences. The leaders and workers from the terai region urged the Maoist leaders to take immediate steps to resolve this problem.

"5980",20072554,"Title: South Asia flood victims desperate for clean water and food.rtf; Date: August 6, 2007 Monday 5:12 AM GMT; Text: Many of the millions of people forced from their homes by floods across South Asia were desperate for food and drinking water Monday as relief operations continued.
The flooding, described as the heaviest in 30 years, has affected more than 25 million people and killed at least 1,450 others in Bangladesh, India and Nepal since monsoon rains began pouring down in June.
The disaster has hit India's Bihar state the worst, where some of the growing number of people marooned by swirling, muddy water fought for emergency food supplies.
""The total number of people now affected are 11.5 million,"" said Manoj Srivastava, the state's disaster management chief, adding that more than 6,000 villages were flooded with at least two million people living outdoors.
One teenager in the state drowned Sunday in a fight for a packet of relief supplies, police said.
The skies cleared Monday, but a United Nations official warned that rivers upstream in neighbouring Nepal were still overflowing, making it unlikely the flood water would recede in Bihar soon.
""If there is more water from Nepal then the situation will only get worse,"" Job Zachariah, the head of the Bihar chapter of the child welfare agency UNICEF, told AFP.
Helicopters were dropping thousands of emergency packets containing dry rations, candles, plastic sheets and matches over areas of northern Bihar, but some villagers said supplies were sinking into the flood water.
At least 1,120 people have died in India from causes linked to this season's monsoon. Large parts of northern Uttar Pradesh and northeastern Assam states are submerged.
Officials put the total number of those affected by the flood in the three states at more than 18 million. But many villagers were returning to their homes in Assam as flood waters receded.
Heavy rainfall combined with Himalayan snow melt gave rise to massive floods late July in large parts of South Asia, including southern Nepal, northern India and Bangladesh, where 40 percent of the land has been inundated.
Nearly 250 people have died in Bangladesh, a delta nation prone to floods, since the start of the monsoon. Some 120 of them died in the last 10 days, officials in the capital, Dhaka, have said.
About eight million people have also been displaced in the country, which is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers. Floods cover at least a fifth of its land each summer.
In Nepal, at least 91 people have died in landslides and floods since the beginning of June, officials have said.
Some 270,000 people have also been affected, mostly in the southern plains bordering India's Bihar state. Residents slowly began returning home Sunday as monsoon rains began to ease, Nepali officials said.
The United Nations World Food Programme has started a mission to feed about 60,000 people in the worst-hit areas of the Himalayan country over the next three months.

Three people were arrested at the scene of the blast and the number of injured increased from 45 overnight, Yogeshwor Rom Khami, a senior local police officer, told AFP.
The bombing at late Wednesday's rally is believed to have been carried out by one of around two dozen armed ethnic groups that have emerged in the last year and are fighting for greater representation for ethnic Mahadhesis in national politics.
The rally had been organised by former rebel Maoists and mainstream political parties, who signed a peace deal in November 2006, to prepare the area for April 10 elections that will decide the country's political future.
""Several groups have claimed responsibility. The extremist Mahadhesi groups are using this as an opportunity for publicity,"" the police officer said from Birgunj, 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Kathmandu.
The investigation was ongoing.
Armed Mahadhesi groups have vowed to derail the polls unless the government immediately grants the region increased autonomy.
Scores of people have been killed in unrest that began just over a year ago in the fertile southern plains region bordering India.
Mahadhesis, residents of the southern plains, make up around half of Nepal's 27 million population and say they have long been treated as second class citizens being underrepresented in the government, army and police.

""Unless the problem is addressed on a war-footing in India, the killer disease could become as devastating as in Africa,"" West Bengal Health Minister Surya Kanta Mishra told the conference.
Speaking at an eight-day conference in West Bengal's Calcutta Mishra said: ""HIV and AIDS is not only a health problem, it has a far-reaching impact on the developing economy of India,
The conference has drawn more than 5,000 sex workers from various Indian states and delegates of sex workers' organisations from Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, New Zealand and Canada to look at ways of battling the disease.
An estimated 30,000 sex workers are expected to attend over the course of the week.
""AIDS threatens to become a crisis of alarming proportion in India, undermining public health development unless an urgent action plan is adopted to slow the spread of the disease,"" India's Health Secretary J.V.R. Prasad Rao told an international conference of sex workers.
An Indian government-funded project launched 12 years ago in Sonagachi, housing more than 8,000 sex workers, has successfully slowed the spread of HIV/AIDS, and can serve as an example for similar scheme nationwide, Rao said.
""We must send a message across the country that urgent action, based on the Sonagachi model, is needed to fight HIV and AIDS in India,"" he told the meeting.
The programme combines free distribution of condoms with an education campaign.
There are more than two million sex workers in India who are highly susceptible to the disease because of reluctance by Indian males to use condoms and ignorance about the disease, experts say.
India officially has around 4.58 million people living with HIV/AIDS, second only to South Africa's five million, and a recent study warned that the figure could skyrocket if urgent action is not taken.
According to the World Health Organisation, 95 percent of the 40 million people infected with the virus live in developing nations.
Some 30 million people have died of AIDS while around 14,000 are infected with HIV each day around the world.

"3394",20043334,"Title: India fears lake formed by landslide in Chinese Himalayas could burst, threatening thousands_1.rtf; Date: August 12, 2004 Thursday; Text: Army soldiers and air force helicopters were on alert Thursday in northern India amid fears that a lake created by landslides in the Chinese Himalayas could burst, triggering cross-border floods and threatening thousands of people.
Air force helicopters were ready at bases across northern India in case they need to mount an emergency rescue. Aerial surveys - and a warning by China's government - indicate the lake formed by the blocking of the Parechu River in Tibet is ready to burst its banks and inundate hundreds of villages in India's Himachal Pradesh state.
Chinese engineers Thursday carried out restricted dynamite blasts at the lake to let out controlled quantities of water and prevent a breach in the sides of the lake, a Chinese Embassy spokeswoman said.
""This will reduce the danger of the lake bursting its sides. Water will be let off, preventing overflows,"" the spokeswoman, Yang Shuying, told The Associated Press.
The state has evacuated thousands of people from 50 villages that are likely to be submerged if the lake breaches its banks, said Munish Garg, a top government official in Kinnaur district of the state.
Chinese authorities, who have been monitoring the lake since it was formed after a massive landslide last month, on Wednesday warned India to ""make preparations for disaster prevention,"" Yang said.
The blockage is in a remote region in the Himalayas marked by difficult terrain and poor access,
""The increase in rainfall and water flow from the upper reaches results in continuous rise of water level and the possibility of the dam bursting or overflowing at any time,"" Yang said.
The Indian army and air force have activated their disaster management plan, setting up emergency teams of doctors and medical assistants, and technicians and engineers to help restore telecommunications, roads and bridges, Col. S.K. Sakhuja, the Indian army spokesman, told The Associated Press.
A similar seasonal lake formed and overflowed in August 2000, killing more than 100 people and washing away dozens of bridges and roads in Himachal Pradesh.
If the lake overflows, torrents of water would rush into the already gushing Sutlej River in India, which flows through Himachal Pradesh and Punjab states before draining into the Indus River in Pakistan.
Since monsoon rains and flooding began in June, 2,061 people have died in South Asia, according to official figures compiled by The Associated Press. Most of the death, 1,215, have occurred in India, with 717 killed in Bangladesh, 124 in Nepal and five in Pakistan as a result of drowning, mudslides, house collapses and waterborne diseases.
Aid workers and government departments were Thursday carrying out relief operations In India's worst-hit Bihar state, where hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless by the seasonal floods and 698 have died.
""It is ironical that flood waters have devastated 20 districts while the rest of the state (18 more districts) is in the grip of severe drought,"" said Upendra Sharma, a top official in Patna, the state capital.
Rain swollen rivers in eastern India were receding but remained above the danger mark Thursday, Sharma said.

"1905",20044383,"Title: Nepal government offers to hold peace talks with Maoist rebels.rtf; Date: July 19, 2004 Monday; Text: Nepal's new coalition government has decided to hold peace talks with Maoist rebels who have been waging a bloody ""people's war"" in the Himalayan kingdom since 1996, officials said Monday.
Government officials were in contact with rebel leaders in a bid to smooth the way for peace talks, sources said, amid reports Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara has arrived in Kathmandu.
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting last Thursday, according to a government statement released at a media conference here on Monday.
""The cabinet has decided to call the help of all quarters to help the government to hold a meaningful, reliable and result-oriented peace talks with the Nepal Communist Party-Maoist,"" the statement said.
When asked if a date had been set for the talks, Information and Communications minister Mohammad Mohshin told the press conference: ""We do not want to hold the peace talks in haste but move ahead and make the dialogue successful and effective -- unlike the ones in the past that ended in failure.""
Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari said at the weekend the government's central goal was to get the Maoist rebels to negotiate and end their deadly bid to install a communist government.
The revolt has claimed 9,500 lives since 1996.
Last week, a Maoist leader said the rebels would be ready for a new ceasefire if the government met their key demand of an assembly to rewrite the constitution.
The rebels, who control much of the kingdom, have stepped up violence after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba formed the four-party coalition, which is Nepal's most broadly backed government in two years.
""We are ready to announce a ceasefire and hold dialogue with the present government only if it is ready for constituent assembly elections under United Nations observation,"" Bam Dev Chhetri, a senior member of the Maoist Central Committee, told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location.
The Maoist demand for the assembly scuttled two previous bids to broker an end to Nepal's civil war.
King Gyanendra fired Deuba in 2002 and handpicked a new government, but reappointed Deuba on June 2 after months of pro-democracy protests.
The communists and two smaller parties joined Deuba's cabinet after the premier said he enjoyed full governing powers.

 Meanwhile, the secretary of the Maoist organization in Rautahat, Bipin Rai, said over the phone that the teachers were to attend a pre-planned programme. The Maoists claimed that the teachers will be released in two days.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 30 July
Kathmandu, 29 July: Former Nepalese envoy to the UN, Murari Raj Sharma, has said the visiting UN delegation does not have a ""special mandate"" because of the letter sent by Maoist Chairman Prachanda.
He said this happened because the government and the Maoists sent separate letters after disagreement over key issues. Sharma said the UN delegation had nearly postponed Nepal visit because of Prachanda's letter.
He said the government and the Maoists should forge consensus on the issue of arms management and move ahead. ""Until the parties to the conflict build consensus on basic issues, the UN cannot take the work ahead,"" he said.
""The [UN] delegation came to Nepal just to avoid sending a wrong message. The delegation, however, does not have a special mandate,"" Sharma said speaking at the Reporters' Club, Kathmandu, Saturday [29 July]. [passage omitted: Other speakers also spoke on the occasion]

"5654",20061321,"Title: Maoists to give peace a chance.rtf; Date: November 18, 2006 Saturday 10:45 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Nov 18 -- THE FIRST thing Maoists in Nepal would like to see as they engage in the development of a democratic setup in that country is the abolition of, what they call, ""the monarchical feudal autocracy"".
  Top Nepalese Maoist leader Prachanda made this clear at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit here on Saturday, speaking for the first time at an international public forum.
  The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) chairman, whose cadres fought a bitter battle for over a decade against the monarchy in Nepal, refused to abjure violence and chose to remain ambiguous about the use of violence to achieve political ends.
  Prachanda said the role of violence needed to be viewed in ""relative"" terms. ""Violence can be condemned in absolute terms. We do not see it in absolute terms, but in relative terms, depending on the situation. When there will be a conducive atmosphere for economic growth, there will be no need for violence,"" he responded to a question.
  ""We are sorry for the killing of so many people,"" he said, when asked whether the Maoists were comfortable being labelled terrorists. ""Everywhere, in revolutionary movements, it is the people who have to sacrifice.""
  But he stressed that the Maoists would adhere to the broad time-line agreed to in the comprehensive peace agreement, due to be signed on November 21, and would join the multi-party mainstream of democracy. ""The recent political agreement between the Seven-Party Alliance government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) is aimed at conducting free and fair election to the Constituent Assembly under an interim government to institutionalise the democratic republic,"" he said.
  The main leadership of the Maoists - Prachanda himself, Baburam Bhattarai and Badal - will not join the interim government, but will definitely contest elections. Prachanda also conceded his desire to be the first head of a republican democracy - not for himself, but ""if the party wants it"".
  Speaking on the future of the monarchy, Prachanda said, ""The king will have no hold over anything. Possessions would be nationalised. If the present king is found to have been involved in corruption, he would be tried accordingly.""
  ""He is likely to be removed in the first session. If the people vote for the monarchy to remain, even as a symbol, we would carry out a non-violent campaign. We do not want the monarchy to remain even as a symbol,"" he added.
  On the issue of disarming the Maoist cadres, Prachanda said, ""The arms will be locked up in iron boxes with keys with the United Nations' observers. The cadres would, of course, retain some arms and ammunition for self-defence, according to international standards and under the supervision of international observers.""
  Responding to questions on the future of the army and his armed cadres, he said, ""After the elections, both would be merged into a new national army. The old army would be democratised and the cadres professionalised. They would be jointly trained under UN observation. The new national army would be a small one - between 20,000 and 30,000 personnel.""
  Prachanda dismissed the Indian government's apprehensions of possible links with the Maoists in India. ""There are ideological differences between the movement in India and the Nepalese movement. We never had any working link. There is no link between Pashupati to Tirupati,"" he said.

The team is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal, it said.
Another member of the team, Telecommunications Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, said he hoped talks would begin immediately.
""The formation of the talk team has once again proved that the government is sincere,"" he said.
""His Majesty's government is committed to the ceasefire and to converting it into permanent peace.""
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire in January and have expressed a willingness to hold talks aimed at ending a six-year insurgency that has left more than 7,800 people dead.
A date for talks has not yet been set and the Maoists had criticised the government for the delay in forming their negotiating team.
The rebels announced their five-member team, headed by Babu Ram Bhattarai, in January, a day after the truce was announced.
The two sides had their first formal contact Sunday in a goodwill meeting.
The other members of the government team are Telecommunications Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, Health Minister Upendra Devkota, Physical Planning and Works Minister Narayan Singh Pun, Labour and Transport Management Minister Kamal Prasad Chaulagain and Women, Children and Social Welfare Minister Anuradha Koirala.
Bhattarai said he was delighted that the government had ""finally appointed a negotiating team.""
""We are pleased to hold peace dialogues with the negotiating team headed by Deputy Prime Minister Badri Prasad Mandal along with other five cabinet ministers,"" Bhattarai told journalists.
Previously the rebels had said they would only hold talks with King Gyanendra, because the government, which was appointed by the king after he sacked the elected prime minister, did not have a mandate for negotiations.
But Bhattarai said: ""We have not changed our stand but our expectation is to hold the dialogues. Since the ministers are appointed by the king, we have no objection to holding talks with them.""
""We will try to seek the opinion of all the political parties during the talks,"" he added.
Bhattarai said neither he or other rebel leaders had met the king or approached him for a meeting, but said they were prepared to see him at any time.
He claimed the talks would focus on the setting up of a round-table conference to discuss the formation of an all-party government and constituent assembly elections to redraft the constitution.

The announcement came Tuesday after the local media quoted student union officials as saying plans for the strike had been scrapped following appeals from schools and businesses who said the stoppage would be too disruptive.
The student union described the reports as baseless.
""We have decided to go ahead with our plan to call a general strike from February 25 to 29 and we call upon all to help make our plan a success,"" it said in a statement.
Nepalis often heed the frequent strike calls by the Maoists or groups backing them as much out of fear of reprisals as support for their cause.
The impoverished nation has been in the grips of an increasingly deadly revolt by the rebels who have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and install a communist republic.
The rebellion has so far claimed more than 9,000 lives.
The crisis deepened in 2002 when King Gynanendra dismissed the elected government, saying it was incompetent to tackle the insurgency.

""There was panic at the scene when the bridge fell (on Tuesday) so initial estimates were too high. It's a miracle not a larger number of people died,"" district officer Anik Kumar Pandey said by telephone from the remote area.
Police had earlier said they feared hundreds of people had died when the 500-metre (1,650-foot) bridge plunged into the gorge 380 kilometres (240 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. 
Some 400 people heading for a religious ceremony were on the year-old suspension bridge over the Bheri river when one of its supporting pillars gave way.
But many who fell into the icy water managed to swim to safety, police said. Others scrambled to land after clinging on to the fallen bridge, only one-third of which was submerged.
""We've recovered 16 bodies and 25 people are still missing,"" Pandey said.
Hundreds of police and soldiers were still looking for the missing.
Officials believed the missing might have been swept downstream into the mainly agricultural countryside that surrounds the Bheri, one of Nepal's largest rivers.
The bridge was crowded with locals who going to a Hindu religious ceremony to celebrate the full moon.
Nepal has hundreds of small bridges in the rugged countryside that range from rope or wooden planks to steel and concrete.
The landlocked Himalayan nation is criss-crossed by dozens of rivers across one of the steepest topographies in the world.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 23 April
Kathmandu, 23 April: Leaders of the Nepali Congress are divided over the issue of joining the new government going to be formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist.
NC central leader Shekhar Koirala, who is also nephew of the party president and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, said: ""Congress leaders are sharply divided over the issue and each group has strong reasons to support its stance.""
""I personally feel there is no harm in joining the Maoist-led government if they meet certain conditions, including Maoists' strict adherence to peace agreements, returning of all seized property and dissolution of parallel state mechanisms,"" he said.
""The Maoist leadership must make the Young Communist League cadres renounce violence, which they have been indulging in even after the elections,"" he added.
Dr Shanshak Koirala, on the other hand, has publicly stated that the party should pay more attention on consolidating the its base than joining the government.
NC leaders Minister for Peace and Reconciliation Ram Chandra Poudel and Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat want the NC to be a part of the new government.
""The Maoists have not even secured a simple majority, and the issue of which parties will join the government is trivial. Consensus is the only way out since two-third majority is needed to endorse a new constitution,"" he said.
NC general secretary Gopal Man Shrestha said the party should not join the government led by the Maoists until they fulfil certain conditions.
""It all depends on how they transform themselves. They have to dissolve the YCL, sincerely accept multiparty system and should tolerate opponents,"" he said.
However, other bigwigs in the party, including NC joint general secretary and spokesman Arjun Narsingh K.C. and Laxman Prasad Ghimire are of the view that the party should not join the Maoist-led government.
Ghimire went on to claim: ""If reports pouring in from across the country are anything to go by, 99.9 per cent of the party activists do not want the party to join the Maoist-led government.""
""The Maoists have not adhered to the previous agreements. Now why should we believe that they would accept the conditions? Still, why should it be presumed that they would lead the government in the first place. They have not even secured a simple majority,"" he added.
Vocal critics of the Maoists, including Govinda Raj Joshi, Khum Bahadur Khadka, Chiranjivi Wagle, also do not want the party to join the Maoist-led government, according to the party sources.

The ATS, which has sought details related to the blasts from the district police, will also probe police's role in the investigation as those arrested were acquitted by the court while several other accused are still at large.
Six persons were killed and many others injured in two powerful explosions in Agra in 2000. Confirming this to HT, a senior police official said here on Tuesday, ""Two persons were killed and 18 others injured when a roadways bus on way to Agra from Haathras was blown up in March 2000. Five months later, bombs ? meant to blow up the local stadium during the Independence Day function ? went off in a house at Sadar market. Four youths, who were apparently making those bombs, were killed in the explosion.""
Surprisingly, Md Varish alias Raja, a resident of Gunjrawala in Pakistan, who was held in connection with the bus blast two weeks after the incident, was acquitted by a local court in May 2004.
Not only this, several persons, including Abdul Mobin and Maruf, were for held the Sadar market blast but were given a clean chit by court in February 2005.
The Uttar Pradesh police had, after the arrest, termed the two as dreaded terrorists belonging to the Hizbul Mujahideen.
The then DGP had described the two as a big catch. While Maroof was nabbed from Agra, Abdul Mobin was held from Aligarh. Around 500 grams of RDX was also seized from Mobin during the raid. While Maroof was a resident of Ambedkarnagar, Mobin hailed from Siddharthnagar, bordering Nepal. Maroof was among those making bombs at the time of explosion but he managed to escape. Later, police recovered a huge quantity of explosives and time devices along with the bodies of Hanif, Mohammad Waqar and Sajid from the spot. An ATS official said, ""Md Yusuf is still at large though police have declared a cash reward on his head for his involvement in the bus blast case.

During the second round of negotiations, the government is expected to give its reply to a set of demands -- political, economic, and social -- placed before it by the rebels during the first round of talks on April 27.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for seven years to establish a communist republic in Nepal, and are demanding an interim government be formed and a people's constituent assembly elected to draft a new Constitution.
A roundtable conference of all political forces in the kingdom should precede the formation of an interim government, they say.

Unrest has been mounting in the kingdom over King Gyanendra's refusal to reinstate democratic rule after he dismissed the elected government in October 2002, accusing it of incompetence in tackling a deadly Maoist insurgency.
Last week, some 8,000 protesters marched through Kathmandu to demand the formation of an all-party government before elections that Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, a royalist appointed by the king, has said he wants to be held in November.
The weekend meeting was attended by the Nepali Congress, the country's largest party, the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), the United Front-Nepal, the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party and the pro-India Nepal Sadbhawana Party.
""We have decided to do something concrete to lend more vigor and effectiveness to the protest and disobedience programmes,"" the statement signed by leaders of the five parties said.
The statement said the civil disobedience programme would start April 1 and be highlighted by a massive political rally. The five parties would form a joint task force to chalk out a detailed plan of disobedience programmes.
""A new mode of operation will be adopted to intensify the protest movement against the anti-democratic forces,"" former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who heads the Nepali Congress, told reporters.
NCP-UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, the consensus candidate for prime minister among the five major parties, said: ""From now on, the movement will be fierce and furious.""
His group was the main opposition party in the last parliament.
Meanwhile, Maoist rebels set off bombs in municipal buildings in different parts of the country, including in the rebel-infested far west, police said Sunday.
The Maoists have stepped up bomb attacks following a two-week blockade in 14 western Nepal districts that has disrupted food and other shipments.
The rebels have been fighting to set up a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 9,000 lives.

""A Tibetan security man of the Karmapa (a prominent Tibetan leader) named Zigme Gyatso was found in mysterious circumstances with a young Chinese girl Chen Yuan Hann in a guest house,"" a district official said in Bodhgaya in the eastern state of Bihar.
The man could not explain his presence with the Chinese woman and both were taken into custody, police said.

Police released them, but the Indian authorities are keeping a close watch on the woman, police said.
The Dalai Lama will arrive in Bodhgaya later Tuesday for the Tibetan festival Kalchakra Puja which begins on Saturday.
Four Chinese men were arrested for spying when the Dalai Lama visited Bodhgaya last year, officials said.
Huge security cover has been provided to the Nobel Laureate, who will inaugurate the 10-day festival in the Buddhist holy city.
Indian authorities have said they have received death threats against the Dalai Lama from Chinese militant organisations identified as Sugden and Norge, which have links with Nepal's Maoist rebels.
The Dalai Lama is also facing protests from local Buddhists, who accuse him of being anti-Indian and have threatened acts of violence during the visit.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after an abortive uprising in 1959 and established the government-in-exile in India.
China, which has ruled Tibet since 1951, has been accused of trying to wipe out its Buddhist-based culture through political and religious repression and a flood of ethnic Chinese immigration.

A coalition of the country's seven main political parties shunned Wednesday's elections to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power a year ago. The polling also was marred by attacks from communist rebels, an army shooting of protesters and low turnout.
Results declared by the Election Commission on Friday showed three pro-government parties winning 17 mayoralties: 14 for Rastriya Prajatantra Party, including in the capital Katmandu; two for Nepal Sadbhawana Party; and one for Rastriya Janshakti party.
Independent candidates won 15 mayoral seats.
""I understand the problems faced by the city and my priority will be to tackle these problems,"" Katmandu's mayor-elect Rajaram Shrestha said.
Key international allies including India, Japan and the United States said the elections were highly flawed, with Washington calling it a ""hollow attempt"" to legitimize the king's rule.
Japan said in a statement issued by its embassy in Katmandu that it strongly condemned the slaying of civilians, and said it regretted that the royal Nepal government arrested dissidents ahead of the elections.
On Wednesday, government soldiers opened fire on a group of 150 protesters trying to disrupt the vote in a southwestern town, killing one and injuring another.
Neighboring India said an any credible elections much have the active participation of all the mainstream parties.
""Only then would such elections be able to contribute to the restoration of democracy and political stability. As a close and friendly neighbor of Nepal, India wishes to see an early return to peace, stability and development in Nepal,"" Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said in New Delhi.
The elections were for the relatively powerless posts of mayors and local council members, and the dearth of voters at the polls was considered a serious blow to Gyanendra's direct rule.
Associated Press reporter Matthew Rosenberg contributed to this report.

Kathmandu, 20 December: Minister for Law and Justice Niranjan Thapa claimed on Tuesday [20 December] that the Judicial Council did not take up the issue of constitutional legality of the Royal Commission for Corruption Control. However, in a statement he said the council had decided to take up the corruption charges against Birendra Kumar Karna, the former judge of the district court in Pyuthan [mid-west Nepal].
However, he did not mention that the Judicial Council had termed the prosecution of Karna by the Royal Commission for Corruption Control unconstitutional. A news report on Monday had stated that only the Judicial Council had the rights to prosecute a lawyer and file charges against him. The news was based on a report published by the Judicial Council on Sunday.

The New Delhi-based Fabindia has the option to buy the balance stake and take full control of the foreign retailer within a year, said a top company executive.
Although the deal size could not be independently ascertained, industry insiders peg it between Rs 35-40 crore for 62.5% stake. “With the acquisition, we have the option of getting EAST products into India and also improving our apparel line using their design capabilities and technology,” said Sunil Chainani who represents Fabindia on the board of EAST. He, however, refused to disclose the deal size.
Fabindia, known for its handcrafted jewellery and Kurta made from hand-woven fabric, acquired a 25% stake in EAST, for an undisclosed amount in early 2009 with the option of acquiring the rest in the next three years.
EAST, originally called Anokhi, was started by Clive Pettigrew, Penny Oliver and Jonathan Keating in 1986. The stores were rebranded EAST in 1994. Both Clive and Penny are on the company's board.
Acquisition by Fabindia will, however, see change in the board over the next few months, Chainani said. The UK retailer, with annual revenue of ?40 million, sells womenwear through 64 exclusive outlets and also through the high-end department store John Lewis only in the UK.
Although retail scenario in Europe was going through a tough time, Fabindia's experience with EAST over the last two years has been positive, Chainani said. The foreign retailer is expected to post a marginal growth this year even as profit margins continue to remain under pressure.
“The association with Fabindia is great for us because it gives security and also represents exciting opportunities,” said Suzi Spink, COO, EAST .
Besides garments, EAST offers jewellery as well as accessories sourced from India, China and the South-East Asian countries. It recently introduced two sub brands - EAST Artisan and EAST Boutique. Fabindia, founded by a young American John Bissell in 1960, currently operates stores in 58 cities in India.
It also enjoys a presence in overseas markets such as Italy, Nepal and United Arab Emirates. The company plans to open around 300 small format stores in tier-III cities such as Karnal, Vellore, Rishikesh and Rudrapur.
To fund the expansion, Fabindia has invited bids from PEs for investing around Rs 200 crore and also buying the 8% stake held by Wolfensohn Capital Partners, a private equity fund promoted by former World Bank President James Wolfensohn. Fabindia posted net profit of Rs 40 crore on a standalone revenue of.`420 crore in 2010-11, while its EBIDTA was around 16%.

"5197",2006720,"Title: Nepal government orders citizens to ignore Maoist strike call.rtf; Date: February 5, 2006 Sunday 1:47 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's royal government has ordered citizens to ignore a Maoist rebel call for a week-long general strike due to begin Sunday as part of a guerrilla drive to derail controversial polls.
Authorities threatened to arrest anyone taking part in the shutdown declared by the rebels in a bid to thwart next Wednesday's local elections.
The municipal elections were announced by King Gyanendra, who seized power a year ago, as part of a plan to restore democracy.
""The security forces on duty would have to take action as per the law if anyone is found involved in closing down the bazaar forcibly, obstructing traffic or indulging in vandalism"" during the strike, the Home Ministry said.
A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police were on high alert and added ""more security personnel will be mobilized."" 
The home ministry also told people to carry identification papers ""to help the security forces presently involved in a strict security search."" 
In the past, Maoist strikes and blockades have paralysed the ancient temple-studded capital of 1.5 million people and disrupted delivery of goods. 
Military convoys have been forced to accompany vehicles to prevent rebel attacks.
Police, meanwhile, reported no deaths or injuries in Nepalgunj, a town near the border with India, after a Maoist attack late Friday -- the latest in a series the rebels have vowed as part of their efforts to foil the polls.
The polls are part of the ""road map"" to democracy announced by Gyanendra, who has pledged they will be followed by general elections in the next 15 months. 
But the municipal elections are opposed by the Maoists and opposition parties, who have formed a loose alliance against the king. They condemn the polls as a sham aimed at legitimising the king's power grab. 
The recent killings of two candidates meant turnout on Wednesday was likely to be tiny, the head of a human rights organization said.
""People have been terrified after recent incidents so turnout will be very thin,"" said Subodh Pyakurel, chairman of the Informal Sector Service Centre.
The polls are also facing a dearth of candidates -- just over 3,600 people registered to stand for 4,146 available posts.
By holding the polls, ""the king is trying to give legitimacy"" to those who ""do not represent the actual voice of the people,"" said Dhurba Hari Adhikari, president of the Nepal Press Institute. 
The Maoists have been fighting to establish a communist republic for the last 10 years -- a conflict that has claimed at least 12,500 lives.
Gyanendra said he seized power to quell the insurgency but analysts say his moves have left him politically stranded and he is far from achieving his goal.

 Naxalbari, Siliguri (India), 4 April: An official of India's investigation agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has ruled out immediate extradition of the arrested top Maoist leader Mohan Vaidya alias Kiran to Nepal.
 An official who did not want to be named said Saturday 3 April that since there was enough evidence to prove that Vaidya and his companion Narayan Bikram Pradhan were involved in ""anti-social work on Indian soil"", they would be tried in Indian court and could be jailed for at least six months or more as per their offence.
Kantipuronline.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Apr 04
He claimed that with the discovery of evidence that Vaidya had established contacts with Indian militant organizations the KLO and ULFA Kamtapur Liberation Organization and United Liberation Front of Assam , the case could become more ""complicated and sensitive"".
 Vaidya has not yet given his statement to the police, citing poor health condition.
 The Maoist leader, believed to be second-in-command after party chairman ""Prachanda"", was arrested along with Pradhan at the latter's house in Darjeelingmode in Siliguri last Monday. Vaidya was recuperating after a recent eye surgery.
 The official also claimed that about 150 fighters of the KLO entered east Nepal to help the Maoists. He added that in the last two years, the Maoists had been increasing their influence in the Nepali-speaking populace in the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal.

 Kathmandu, 29 September: A plane of Vega Airlines, a private Bulgarian cargo company, carrying arms for Nepal police, landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Wednesday [29 September]. TIA officials confirmed the arrival of the plane.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 30 Sep 04
Constance C. Jones, spokesperson of the US embassy in Kathmandu, confirmed the statement of the American embassy in New Delhi that the arms were meant for training Nepal police personnel. The US embassy in New Delhi, denying that it was a US plane, said the US State Department is training the Nepal police to develop anti-terrorist capabilities and that the plane was carrying equipment for this purpose.
 Jones told the Post that it was part of a regular training programme of the US government to train police forces around the world and denied it was meant for the army.
 The New Delhi statement said the plane carrying equipment for the Nepal police left Bulgaria on Tuesday, landed in India on Wednesday and was cleared to leave for Nepal, according to agency reports. However, the Indian daily The Hindu reported that the plane was detained at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, since Saturday before it was allowed to fly to Nepal.

 The total number of disappearances from the state and the Maoist rebels in the last four years has alarmingly crossed 700, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said in a press meet on Thursday 4 December .
 Of the total disappearances (717), 587 were from the security forces and 111 from the rebels, said the national rights watchdog.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 4 Dec 03The rest, 18 disappearances, were made from unknown people, the NHRC said. ""Details of one more disappeared could not be known.""
 Of the total disappeared people, the commission said, 651 were men and 66 women.  passage omitted
 ""It is a matter of grave concern that disappearances are frequently occurring in a democratic country like ours,"" Nain Bahadur Khatri, chairman of NHRC, said on the occasion.
 Khatri further said the commission has plans to make the state and the rebels aware of the disappearances.
 ""For this, our main agenda for the upcoming international human rights day (on 10 December) will be disappearances,"" he said. ""With the increasing number of disappearances, it seems that both the warring sides are seeking military' solutions.""
 On formation of Human Rights Promotion Centre by the government, Sushil Pyakurel, an NHRC member, said the NHRC will not work under the coordination of any rights bodies formed by the government.
 A separate act has authorized the NHRC to work independently for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country, Pyakurel said.
 Khatri, Pyakurel and other NHRC members were critical of the annual budget being allocated to the NHRC. ""The NHRC cannot function effectively with the meagre budget it receives,"" they said.

Armed police and soldiers patrolled the streets of the ancient temple-studded city and security was boosted in sensitive areas but authorities said the situation was calm.
""There have been no reports of violence today,"" home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey told AFP.
The end to the curfew imposed last Wednesday coincided with a religious public holiday in the mainly Hindu kingdom and people flocked to temples.
Customers flooded shops that reopened for business.
Authorities ordered the curfew last Wednesday after demonstrators ransacked the main mosque, recruiting company offices and Muslim businesses to protest the killings of the 12 Nepalis by Islamist militants in Iraq. 
A crowd also tried to storm the Egyptian embassy that represents Iraqi interests in Nepal. At least two people were killed and over 50 wounded in clashes between protestors and police.
Passions were inflamed after a statement claiming responsibility for the deaths was posted on an Islamist website by an Al-Qaeda-linked group, the Army of Ansar al-Sunna, accompanied by pictures of a captor holding up the severed head of one hostage like a trophy. A video showed the others being shot.
The 12 Nepalese hostages had flown to the Gulf in search of work as cooks and cleaners. Nepal, which is not part of the US-led coalition in Iraq, is one of the world's poorest nations, resulting in an exodus of tens of thousands of young people to low-level and often risky work overseas.
Muslims account for 3.8 percent of the 27 million people in Nepal which until last week had seen little of the inter-religious violence that has scarred other South Asian nations. Hindus make up 86 percent of the population.
The curfew had been eased for brief periods since Wednesday to allow people time to stock up on food but Monday was the first day it was fully lifted.

 After the arrest of our party's standing committee member and senior leader Comrade Kiran (Mohan Baidya) from Siliguri by the Indian reactionary regime, it has created a big outcry in national and international level. Enemies of revolution have been encouraged by this arrest, while this has created an anger and a feeling of revenge among the leftists and patriotic forces. Also this incident is seen to have created important questions and curiosities in various circles.  passage omitted
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 7 Apr 04, p4
After all what could be the reason behind the arrest of Comrade Kiran at this very period? Does this have any relation with the attack by People's Liberation Army on Bhojpur on 2 March and on Beni on 20 March, grand preparation for Nepal banda general shutdown on 6, 7 and 8 April by party, army and front? We think there is a relation . Because especially after the Beni operation, the dream of the reactionaries to militarily crush us has been shattered.  passage omitted: Beni operation is a milestone in the strategic counterattack of the people's war.
 In the new phase of revolution, it should not be difficult for anyone to understand that Kiran's sudden arrest is the sum of the real situation of the development of people's war and exigency.
 And the happening of this incident on the eve of the anti-monarchy movement of parliamentary parties that started from 1 April and the speedy advancement of the revolutionary movement has once again helped reveal the plot that there is an unholy alliance between the reactionary rulers of Nepal and India.  passage omitted
 At a time when the pro-parliamentarian and republican forces are readying for a decisive movement, if Comrade Kiran has been manhandled with an internal agreement to sign anti-national agreements on important rivers including Karnali and other issues of military importance, then the rulers of Nepal and India will have to pay a good price for that.  passage omitted
 In sum, however painful the arrest of Comrade Kiran may be for us now, it is an indication that Nepal's people's revolution has attained a new height and in that sense, we must pay enough heed to changing this negative incident into positive revolutionary energy. The arrest of our senior comrade has created hatred and anger against national and international enemies; it has created hatred and anger among not only our party rank and file but also among the general populace. And it is sure to add fuel to the flame of people's revolution. As Comrade Mao said the boulder lifted by the reactionaries against people will ultimately fall on their own feet, and here also it is sure to happen. No history tells us that revolutionary ideology can be murdered and jailed. Though Comrade Kiran, who is physically not well, is in the hands of enemies, his revolutionary ideology will always provide energy to our movement.

"976",20032952,"Title: Killings and bombing leave Kathmandu in state of fear.rtf; Date: January 28, 2003 Tuesday; Text: The brazen killing in Kathmandu of a police chief and the daylight bombing of a customs building packed with workers has left residents of the Nepalese capital grappling with a new reality -- living with fear.
""For the first time in my life I am scared to walk down the street,"" said a woman in her mid-20s who would only give her name as Kabita.
""We feel threatened even though there is a police post nearby,"" she said Tuesday, clutching her three-year-old daughter Sanjita to her bosom as she tended a herd of goats on scrubland next to a busy highway.
Further down the road, wreaths of marigolds marked the spot where police chief Krishna Mohan Shrestha, his wife and his bodyguard were gunned down by an armed group while taking an early-morning walk on Sunday.
Until now, Kathmandu has been spared the brunt of the violence linked to a seven-year-old Maoist rebellion. But police blame Maoist rebels for the attack on Shrestha.
The bombing in another part of Kathmandu Tuesday of a government customs house -- despite a huge security dragnet -- injured no one but damaged the already fragile sense of safety of ordinary residents.
""Nobody is safe in Kathmandu anymore,"" said worker Ajaya Sharma, who was sent fleeing from his office by the early afternoon blast.
Many Kathmandu residents were reluctant to speak, fearing they would be singled out by the rebels, while those who did agree to be interviewed refused to give their names or offered pseudonyms.
One man, who tends a shrine to the Hindu god Ganesh directly opposite the place where Shrestha was killed, admitted to AFP his peace of mind had been shattered by killings so close to his front door.
""If the police chief is not safe, no one is safe,"" he said. ""I am really scared, but I have nowhere to go -- I have to stay here.""
Another man called for better security and more police and army patrols in Kathmandu.
""People are no longer safe,"" said a woman sitting in the pale wintry sun peeling piles of garlic cloves in preparation for a feast linked to an upcoming Hindu ritual.
""We don't let our children out at night,"" she added. ""And we don't stay out late at night either,"" added her husband.
""We have never felt this insecure before,"" he added.
At the nearby Paradise private school which accommodates 275 pupils, teachers' coordinator Deepak K.C. said that since Sunday, arrangements had been made so that children using the school bus would be dropped right outside their houses.
Children in rural areas are often rounded up at schools by the rebels and forced to join the ""people's war"" which has already claimed some 7,800 lives. However, such abductions seldom occur in the capital.
""The government doesn't take it too seriously -- when there is an incident they send reinforcements, but then quickly take them away again. We need security to be constant,"" he said.
Constant security is what the commander of the nearby ramshackle police post says he is trying to provide.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told AFP that an extra 50 police personnel had been deployed in the district since Sunday's assassinations.
""The crucial time for terrorist strikes is between 4:00 am and 8:00 am and between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm,"" he said. ""During these hours we do intensive patrolling, along with the army.""
""We want to give people a sense of security,"" he added. However, his police post on top of hillock, protected only by a few sandbags, looks anything but secure.

Speaking at an interaction programme here in the capital today, Nepal claimed that it was his fellow leader and PM Khanal's personal decision to grant home ministry to Maoists and that the party has nothing to do with the decision. ""So the PM himself should be responsible for its long-term consequences,"" he warned.
The former prime minister also said there has been a serious discussion going on at the party's politburo meeting that kicked off on Thursday and added that the Central Committee meeting on a following date would come up with the party's clear stance on the PM's 'unilateral' decision.
Describing Maoists' preference for home ministry as their disguised tactics to launch the people's revolt, the former prime minister said allocating home portfolio to UCPN-Maoist  meant handing a 'clean chit' to its cadres for 'committing crime and spreading terror' in society.
""Giving Maoist home ministry is tantamount to giving them free rein to commit human trafficking and robbery and to allow them to clear forests and spread violence,"" he said, adding that there is no knowing how many cadres of YCL have  visited police by now to give them their instructions.""
Nepal however opined that the Khanal-led government should not be toppled unless a clear foundation for a consensus government is created first. "" Let there be no confusion about me. I am not the revenge seeking kind of person,"" he said.
Nepal further said the tenure of the Constituent Assembly should not be extended in the existing situation. He however said the CA's term could be extended by some three/four months given there emerge sufficient reasons to believe that the peace and statute drafting processes could be completed within that time.

"6711",20083471,"Title: FLOOD NOURISHES BIHAR POLITICS.rtf; Date: September 17, 2008 Wednesday 5:50 PM  EST; Text: Patna, Sep 17 -- Although the Bihar flood proved to be a bane for about 30 lakh people, it came as a boon for politicians. Leaders across the political spectrum are trading charges against each other.
Meanwhile, the floodwater receded a bit but the fear of another flood haunts the victims. Even Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has warned people against going back to their houses, as, according to him, there was a danger till October 15. Hapless people who have taken shelter in 321 relief camps are reportedly losing patience and cursing their fate.
Destruction and devastation have inflicted a permanent scar on the minds of the people. Many have migrated to other places but those could not move out remain psychologically vulnerable.
The children and the old are the worst sufferers. Every time food packets are distributed in their camps, the mothers with children in their laps, stretch out their hands. The fortunate manage to grab one or two while others wait for their turn next time.
The elder one sitting outside the camp tent with a thin stick seemingly could not withstand the rush for food. They too try to stretch their hands a bit but that was hardly noticed in the rush of maddening crowd. Before they were noticed, the food stuffs got finished. They sit as last person in the last row when food was served in the camps.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister is fighting many battles to tide over the crisis. Everyday he meets a number of people, institutions and organisations to receive cheques or relief materials for the flood victims.
On Tuesday, he met Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda and discussed issues related to the flood. Already Rs 90 crore have been spent. Besides, NGOs, organisations and individuals have extended their helping hand.
About 31.40 per cent of the total 94,41,702 lakh population of five districts of Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Purnea and Katihar have been badly hit by the flood. According to official records, total 984 villages have been hit. Over 3 lakh people have taken shelter in 321 relief camps.
The Government records further said altogether 1229 hand pumps have been installed while 180 health camps, 190 animal medical centres were set up in the area. However, the Opposition RJD, LJP and Congress are leaving no stones unturned to push the Government to the corner.
""Nitish Kumar should resign as he was responsible for the flood. We've already filed a chargesheet against him and the quantum of punishment is yet to be decided,"" said RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday.
Lalu also sought details of money spent, including the fund given by the Centre and other agencies, from the State Government. ""The Chief Minister should give us all details as the State Government is the implementing agency,"" he said.
The Railway Minister, who was in the thick of the land-for-job scam, has apparently got an opportunity to deflect the public attention. During the last one month, he visited many times the affected areas and tried his best to make people believe that Nitish Kumar was responsible for the flood.
But, he visited the area, met the people, played his politics and left. Close on the heels of his departure, facilities in the relief camps organised by the Railways too vanished. Similarly, LJP and Congress leaders too blamed the Government for the flood and tried their best to score brownie points . ""In the last 15 years of RJD rule, there were firing incidents during flood relief in which over 19 had lost their lives. Lalu Prasad has no moral right to blame the Nitish Government,"" said Shivanand Tiwari.

Excerpt from report by Suraj Kunbar, published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 13 April
Lalitpur [city adjacent to the capital], 12 April: The administration has prevented inmates held at the Women's Training Center [currently used as a detention center] at Jawalakhel [near the capital] from donating their blood for the treatment of those injured in the [ongoing protest] movement.
Sixty inmates at the center had submitted their names to the Red Cross on 12 April for donating their blood. But a team from the blood transfusion service which went to the center was turned back by police who said no permission had been given.
Acting Chief District Officer of Lalitpur District Ramesh Kumar Shrestha urged the team of health workers who had come to collect the blood to return, citing an order from the Home Ministry.
The team led by Dr Manita Rajkarnikar, which reached the center at noon to collect the blood, waited there for two hours. [Passage omitted]
""This is the first time a team that has gone to collect blood has been turned back like this,"" Dr Rajkarnikar said, adding, ""There is no policy under the Geneva Convention requiring the Red Cross to take permission from the state or the rebels when seeking humanitarian assistance.""
According to leader of the Nepali Congress Govinda Pudasaini, who is being held at the center, those who had submitted their names for donating blood had been waiting for the Red Cross team since morning without eating. According to him, the names of 60 blood donors and the donation program had been given to the head of Lalitpur police Madhav Joshi through assistant sub-inspector Dev Bahadur KC who is assigned to the detention center.
With the start of the general strikes, demand for blood at the blood transfusion center has grown. [Passage omitted]

Baburam Bhattarai, the No. 2 leading figure in the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), told Nepalese businessmen and industrialists the peace talks aimed at resolving a decade-long armed insurgency are stuck in a very crucial phase and are unlikely to move ahead.
Bhattarai accused seven mainstream political parties of dragging their feet in implementing a 12-point understanding signed in November last year earlier between the Maoist rebels and the political parties.
In June this year, they also signed an accord allowing the participation of the rebels in the government, but it has yet to be implemented.
Bhattarai accused Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala of taking orders from ""unseen forces"" and trying to protect King Gyanendra and the army.
The rebel leader said Koirala has no moral right to call for a ceremonial king for Nepal in the future.
On Sunday, Koirala told the same industrialists and businessmen, who are holding a national convention, ""If we don't give any space to the king, he will be frustrated.""
Bhattarai accused the prime minister of conspiring to save the king, contrary to the mandate of last April's successful popular revolt aimed at ending monarchy in its entirety and ushering in a people's republic.
""We caution and warn him (to leave the king). He has to once again decide whether he is on the side of the king or of the people),"" Bhattarai said.
He said the government is trying to delay the peace talks by insisting that the rebels first disarm.
""We will not lay down arms to the Nepalese army, but will do so to the people after the election of a constituent assembly"" to write a new constitution, he said.
Bhattarai said the rebels will not unilaterally walk out of the peace talks and return to the conflict of yesteryears, but would rather launch a new peaceful protest.
The protest, which would be the country's third popular revolt in recent times, following the first and second ones in 1990 and in April this year, would be held in towns and cities across the country and would be intended to end monarchy and get rid of all those who side with it, Bhattarai added.

 Tehran, 15 February: Deputy Foreign Minister for education and research affairs Ali Reza Mo'ayyeri said here on Sunday 15 February that regional peace and stability can only be materialized through cooperation and mutual understanding among countries.
 He added that to attain such an objective, various potentials in the region should be used.
 Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the second International Indian Ocean Region (IOR) Conference held at the Foreign Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies, he further noted: ""Indian Ocean is located in a sensitive and geopolitical region, which has long been appealing to world powerful countries.
IRNA news agency, Tehran, in English 1221 gmt 15 Feb 04
""The region has been the scene of rivalry between the Americans and the ex-Soviet Union during the Cold War era to access its diverse resources and advantages,"" he said.
 Turning to the region's major oil and gas resources as well as its transportation facilities, human resources and other privileges, he noted that despite its high potential, they have not yet been used to the optimum.
 ""Some 75 per cent of the world's total oil reserves lie in the Indian Ocean and if the Caspian resources are added to them, the high significance of the region will be revealed.
 ""However, though the Indian Ocean region houses almost a quarter of the world's population, its available economic opportunities have not yet been used properly,"" he added.
 Referring to the fact that disarmament is the main objective for promotion of security and peace in the world, he reiterated the belief that the Middle East should be converted into a region free from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and that Iran has always been in favour of annihilating nuclear arms there.
 Pointing to terrorism as a global issue, he reiterated the need for campaign against it by all world states, with the exception of one country which cannot have any claim to such a campaign.
 ""After the 11 September terrorist event as well as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Americans' approach towards the Middle East and Indian Ocean regions changed into one of security concern and the US military presence there has made the conditions still more complicated,"" he added.
 Mo'ayyeri referred to the proposal on establishment of a tripartite gas pipeline by Iran, Pakistan and India as one way for economic cooperation among the three neighbouring states which could be greatly profitable.
 The second two-day International IOR Conference entitled ""Security, Energy and IOR"" which opened at the Foreign Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies on Sunday is attended by experts and professors from Australia, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Canada, South Africa and Nepal.
 ""Perspective of Security in the IOR"", ""Concept of Energy Security in IOR"", ""Extra-regional Powers in IOR"", ""Gas Transmission Pipelines in IOR"", ""Environmental Security in IOR"" and ""Regional and Extra-regional Cooperation in IOR"" are among the focal points on the agenda of the two-day meeting.

Text of report by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)
[(Current politics) Report by reporter Sui Xiaofei: ""All-China Journalists Association Issues Statement Strongly Condemning Some Western Media's Distorted, False Reportage on Lhasa Incident""]
Beijing, 26 Mar (Xinhua) - An incident of beating, smashing, looting, and burning happened on 14 March in Lhasa and Western media followed it with great interest. While some of the Western media made relatively objective reportage on it, others made distorted, false reportage in various ways. A few days ago the All-China Journalists Association [ACJA] issued a statement strongly condemning this ugly act of making distorted, false reportage.
The ACJA statement says: The violent incident of beating, smashing, looting, and burning in Tibet's Lhasa was an organized, planned event of serious violent crimes elaborately engineered and incited by the Dalai clique. However, some Western media with ulterior motives, in their reportage of the Lhasa incident, openly violated the most basic journalistic principles of truthfulness, objectivity, and impartiality by writing distorted, false reports. They essentially breached the professional integrity of journalists.
The ACJA statement points out: Truthfulness is the life of news as well as the bounden duty of all journalists. Journalists have always regarded the truthfulness of news as even more important than their lives. Yet, some Western media grossly violated the truth of the matter when reporting the Lhasa incident. When carrying on its website a report entitled ""Tibetans Describe Continued Disturbances,"" for instance, a noted medium abroad used a photo of Chinese public security and armed police officers assisting medical and ambulance men in rescuing wounded common people and, in total disregard of the eye-catching characters ""ji jiu"" [first aid] on the ambulance, matched it with the caption: ""There are many troops in Lhasa."" Another medium described Nepalese police's arresting of Tibetan protesters as ""a new incident that happened in Tibet.""
The ACJA statement points out: Likewise, the objectivity of news is a criterion of value flaunted by Western media. In their reportage of the Lhasa incident, however, some Western media with ulterior motives did not balk at technically manipulating the photos. On a foreign medium's website, a photo of thugs assaulting a military vehicle was cropped into an image of a military vehicle threatening passersby. Some mainstream Western media even made a fuss about figures; for instance, they either gave a vague representation of the casualty figure in the incident of beating, smashing, looting, and burning in Lhasa by adopting the phrase ""it is said"" or exaggerated the fact by saying ""hundreds were wounded or killed"" and ""hundreds of Tibetans were killed."" These rumours were widely broadcasted.
The ACJA statement stresses: Truthfulness, objectivity, and impartiality are the basic principles of journalism. By damaging the truthfulness, objectivity, and impartiality of news, one would essentially be breaking the most basic bottom line of journalism and thus inevitably causing an enormous damage to the media's reputation and public credibility.
The ACJA statement says: As a self-discipline organization of Chinese journalists, the ACJA has all along attached high importance to building journalistic professional ethics among Chinese journalists and been making unremitting efforts to this end. Yet, some foreign colleagues had openly gone against the journalistic spirits of truthfulness, objectivity, and impartiality and the basic professional integrity of journalists in their reportage of the Lhasa incident. The ACJA expresses strong condemnation of this.

"7274",20092460,"Title: Bangladesh mulls one-time transit to India as _test case_.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: October 17, 2009 Saturday
Text of report by Bangladeshi privately-owned newspaper New Age on 17 Oct
Dhaka considers allowing New Delhi to use its territory to carry goods to the north-eastern state of Tripura as a ""test case"", giving a positive nod to India's pending requests for transit, officials said.
Officials of the foreign affairs, shipping and communications ministries said they would want to seek how the decision would be implemented and how it could benefit both the neighbours.
""We consider allowing India transit once as a test case and its result will decide the fate of other proposals floated earlier by New Delhi,"" said a senior official involved in the process.
Officials said once the decision of giving transit to India once for heavy equipment through the Ashuganj Port was done successfully, Bangladesh would then move with other proposals for transit of various modes for the next-door neighbour.
New Delhi in September agreed to provide Dhaka with connectivity to the land-locked Nepal and Bhutan in exchange for access to Bangladesh's Ashuganj port.
Dhaka, during a meeting between the foreign minister, Dipu Moni, and her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna in New Delhi on 8 September, agreed to allow India to use the Bangladesh territory to carry heavy equipment for a power plant at Palatan in Tripura through the Ashuganj port and use the Akhaura-Agartala Road.
The two countries are scheduled to sign a deal on India's access to the Ashuganj Port in May 2010.
The issue of transit will come prominently when the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, will hold talks with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh in New Delhi later this year.
As it did on other occasions, New Delhi will again ask Dhaka for connectivity to its north-eastern states through the Bangladesh territory.
As the country has decided to get connected to the Asian highway network, Bangladesh will request India to divert the route of the Asian Highway through the Aushtagram border, instead of connection through Myanmar [Burma].
Bangladesh does not have any arrangement or talks to have direct access to Myanmar to connect to the Asian highway.
The country has hardly any scope to directly enter Myanmar if and when Dhaka joins the Asian Highway Network in keeping with its already identified and primarily agreed routes connecting India from both sides of the Bangladesh territory.
The three proposed Asian highway network routes are Benapole to Tamabil via Jessore, Dhaka, Kachpur and Sylhet; Banglabandha to Tamabil via Hatikumrul, Dhaka, Kachpur and Sylhet; and Mongla to Myanmar via Jessore, Hatikumrul, Dhaka, Kachpur, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Teknaf.
Asked whether the government will accept India's proposal for infrastructure development for the transit, an official said, without any elaboration, that New Delhi had expressed its willingness to develop Bangladesh's transport network.
The official said: ""They (Indian authorities) have not made any offer of financial packages of benefits when they offered to invest in building the required infrastructures.""
New Delhi has for long been pressing for a transit route through the Bangladesh territory to carry goods from one part of India to another and has offered to invest in transport infrastructures in Bangladesh.
Foreign policy experts, however, feel that allowing India to build infrastructure in Bangladesh for transit might invite New Delhi's unwarranted control over the transport system here and suggest the country should rather mobilise its own resources to invest in road, railway and port development.

"7878",20116807,"Title: England take commanding lead of India Test.rtf; Date: August 1, 2011 Monday; Text: NOTTINGHAM, Aug. 1 -- England century-maker Ian Bell admitted he had been ""naive"" after a bizarre mix-up still ended with him leading his side into a commanding position against India in the second Test.
England, in their second innings, were 441 for six at the close of the third day at Trent Bridge on Sunday, giving them a lead of 374 runs.
Bell made a superb 159, but only after being run out when on 137 off the last ball before tea.
Having completed three runs with Eoin Morgan following a misfield by Praveen Kumar, he sprinted off the field believing the ball had gone for four and was consequently 'dead'.
In fact it was still 'live and, after calling in the third umpire, the on-field officials gave a stunned Bell out.
England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss went to the visitors' dressing room at tea to ask India, whose coach is ex-England supremo Duncan Fletcher, if they wanted the appeal to stand.
And minutes later India withdrew their appeal.
Umpires Marais Erasmus of South Africa and Pakistan's Asad Rauf emerged after tea to boos from spectators, unaware the decision had been reversed, as did India before the jeers became cheers when Bell resumed his innings.
Although Bell made only 22 more runs following the reversal of a decision which was quite correct, he added an additional 69 with Morgan in what turned out to be a fourth wicket partnership of 104.
Bell's eventual 159 included 24 fours and was made in nearly five-and-a-half hours at the crease.
He was finally out when his cut off part-time left-arm spinner Yuvraj Singh was caught by Venkatsai Laxman at slip.
""I was a bit naive to automatically walk off and assume the ball had gone for four,"" Bell admitted after stumps. ""I think the right thing's happened for the spirit of the game.
He added: ""Morgan hit it off his legs and we thought it was probably four, with the way the fielder reacted after he got up.
""I put my bat down after the third and it looked like we were just meandering off for tea.
""I had to wait and the decision was made, (then) the captains and coaches met to see if the decision was going to stand or if they wanted to change it.
""I was in the back room trying to figure out what had happened and whether I was going back into the middle. The umpires had walked out, there were a few of us with pads on and the message got passed on to me.""
India star Rahul Dravid said skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had led a team decision to withdraw the appeal.
""Under the rules he was out, but there was not a nice feeling in the dressing room,"" said Dravid.
""We knew it was not in the spirit of the game. There was unanimity that we should reinstate Ian. The team was led beautifully by Dhoni.""
Left-hander Morgan went to a 60-ball fifty, featuring seven fours, with a straight six against off-spinner Harbhajan Singh before he was one of two wickets that fell to Praveen Kumar with the new ball.
However, wicketkeeper Matt Prior again proved a thorn in India's side with the bat, hooking fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth for six on his way to an unbeaten 64.
He received excellent support from Tim Bresnan, 47 not out, in an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 102.
Bell, 84 not out at lunch and scoring briskly, went to 98 with a fluent cover-driven four off Kumar.
Then a leg-glanced two off Sreesanth saw the 29-year-old Bell to his 15th hundred in 67 Tests and fourth this year.
England scored 417 runs in the day after resuming on 24 for one, still 43 behind despite Stuart Broad taking a hat-trick on Saturday on his way to Test-best figures of six for 46 on his Nottinghamshire home ground.
India's first innings of 288 also saw Dravid make 117 - his 34th Test century and second in as many matches after his 103 not out during England's 196-run first Test win at Lord's.
England will replace India at the top of the ICC's Test Championship table if they win this four-match series 2-0 or better. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

"2971",2004193,"Title: Nepalese official slams ministry's response to Iraq hostage crisis.rtf; Date: September 8, 2004, Wednesday; Text: An unidentified Nepalese Foreign Ministry official has heavily criticized the government's response to the Iraq hostage crisis, saying that Kathmandu must learn from the Indian experience. (Three Indians were released after 42 days in captivity in Iraq, just days after the murder of 12 Nepalese hostages.) The official said communication was never effectively established with the hostage-takers, and that the government was completely unable to convey a coherent message to the hostage-takers either through the media or diplomatic channels. He blamed a shortage of linguists within the ministry, as well as a shift in focus in recent years from political to economic diplomacy, and said diplomatic appointments in recent years have been made as awards for service to a political party of family rather than on the basis of experience or qualifications. The following is the text of a report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 8 September
 Kathmandu, 7 September: Unless total reform is brought in the working system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is the possibility of the recurrence of the incident of 31 August. Foreign affairs experts have expressed the opinion that the Foreign Ministry need to propel itself with special programmes and upgrade its competence level and skills to save the Nepalese abroad from possible difficulties.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Sep 04, p1
""If we had diplomats with the knowledge of Arabic language, we could have communicated our position to the Iraqi terrorists. After hearing what we had to say, there was ample possibility of securing the release of the hostages, said a high level official at the Foreign Ministry to Rajdhani, remorsefully. The high-level official, who did not want to be named, said we could not save them even when the conditions set by the terrorists had been met.
 The kidnappers Ansar-al-Sunnah had wanted the Nepalese not to be sent to Iraq to cooperate with the Americans. Of course, the government has no policy of sending its citizens there. Those who went there secretly had gone there as ordinary workers rather than for assisting the Americans. The government could deliver this message to the underground kidnappers within the country through some television channels but it failed to deliver the it to the weapon-wielding terrorists standing beside its abducted citizens. ""Just as all of the Maoists living in the rural areas cannot watch Nepal Television, Ansar-al-Sunnah too could not possibly hear our message through Al-Jazeera and Al Arabiya television channels,"" says the high level official. ""What is the meaning of the message that does not reach its target?""
 Just one day after 12 Nepalese fell victim to the murder due to inadequate efforts of the Nepal government on 1 September , neighbouring India demonstrated its diplomatic skills by securing the release of its three citizens. ""We have to learn from the Indian diplomatic efforts that secured unharmed release of its citizens who went through distressing 42 days in captivity,"" he says.
 Like Nepal, India too has no embassy in Iraq. Like the Nepalese, the Indian civilians had entered Iraq illegally. Though it has been stated that they Indians had been freed after their employer manpower company paid ransom demanded by the Muslim extremist captors, it is known that the amounts were paid by the Indian government itself.
 To secure the release of its citizens, India mobilized its ambassadors in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt. The families of the three abducted citizens and the whole nation could cheer in joy because India had taken initiative by sending to Iraq its ambassador with knowledge of Arabic language that the kidnappers spoke. ""We could bring the same joy in our country also,"" says the high level Foreign Ministry official.
 On 25 August, four days after the Nepalese were taken hostage in Baghdad the government had, through a letter to the interim government in Iraq, reportedly requested for mediation to secure the release of the citizens. But the Iraq government, which is itself in crisis, greeted the request by arresting 14 other Nepalese rather than mediating. The diplomatic meaning of all this was do not let your citizens enter Iraq, that is the solution of the problem.
 Meanwhile, the Nepalese ambassador in Pakistan who also looks into Iraq affairs, Pushkar Man Singh Rajbhandari, and the ambassador in Qatar, Shyamananda Suman, seem to have made some efforts. But their efforts were limited in dialling telephones from their office and writing letters. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Prakash Saran Mahat on Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya television channels said: ""I request for the release of the innocent Nepalese."" This is only the physical effort made by the government.
 The government could not seek a local mediator with the knowledge of Arabic, or make a request through a Muslim country with which Nepal's diplomatic ties are strong, and to which the Iraq's militants give importa"

 Khadka added that the government is ready to arrange any type of security measures for the Maoists, if they agreed to come to the negotiating table.

"6435",20071701,"Title: Woman linked to Nepal royal massacre to wed in India.rtf; Date: February 21, 2007 Wednesday 12:05 PM GMT; Text: Devyani Rana, once the girlfriend of Nepal's crown prince Dipendra who killed himself and nine family members in a 2001 palace massacre, is due to marry into an Indian family, an official said Wednesday.
Rana, 34, who is related to India's aristocratic Scindia family, fled Nepal after the bloodbath in which a drunken Dipendra shot his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, and seven other royals before killing himself.
Unofficial reports said the crown prince's shooting spree was probably triggered by his parents' opposition to his plans to marry Rana, whose family had been at loggerheads with the kingdom's monarchy.
Devyani, who belongs to the Rana clan that ruled Nepal until 1951, will marry Ashwarya Singh, a grandson of India's human resources development minister and Congress party loyalist Arjun Singh, according to media reports.
Officials at the Scindia family house in New Delhi, where two days of ceremonies will take place beginning Thursday, confirmed that wedding preparations were on.
Rana's father, Pashupati Shamsher Rana, has been one of Nepal's most influential politicians, heading a faction of the Rashtriya Prajatantrik Party.
The June 1, 2001 killings threw Kathmandu into turmoil, and several people were injured in rioting.
Dipendra, who studied at Britain's exclusive Eton College, was proclaimed king while in a coma, before he succumbed to his self-inflicted gunshot injuries two days later.
His uncle, Gyanendra, took over as king and moved to take direct control of the government in February 2005, but was ousted in April 2006 after weeks of massive street protests.
Top Indian politicians, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, have been invited to the wedding, which is expected to be a lavish affair.
The nuptials will be one of the three most keenly awaited Indian wedding ceremonies this year.
Indian media have reported that British model and actress Elizabeth Hurley and Indian businessman Arun Nayar plan a celebrity-packed ceremony at an 18th century heritage hotel in the desert state of Rajasthan.
Bollywood beauty and former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai, and her boyfriend Abhishek Bachchan -- son of acting legend Amitabh Bachchan -- are also reportedly planning to wed in Rajasthan.
Both weddings are said to be scheduled for March.

 Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 4 July
 Kathmandu, 3 July: Individuals and other organizations affiliated with the diplomatic missions here have become aware of being direct or indirect targets of possible ""extortion racket"" of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists). The attention of the diplomatic missions has been drawn to this possibility following a recent letter from the rebels demanding 100,000 rupees from Modern Indian School, which is being managed under the aegis of the Indian embassy in Kathmandu.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 4 Jul 03Similarly, other Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions have received information that Maoists have been extorting money from ex-British and Indian Gurkha soldiers residing in Maoist-dominated areas.
 ""The British Welfare Scheme is directly related to the issue but we have adopted a policy of not giving any donations to the Maoists,"" a high-level official at the British embassy in Kathmandu told The Kathmandu Post. According to sources, two officials from the Indian embassy, who met Maoists leaders Dr Baburam Bhattarai and Matrika Yadav some weeks ago, urged the Maoists not to maintain any links with violent Indian militant organizations.
 Although the Maoist duo is reported to have clarified that they had only ideological links with the Indian outfits, the embassy officials were not convinced, it is learnt. More than a week ago, a top PWG People's War Group leader said that they had links with Nepal's Maoists, as among other such organizations in Asia.

"7583",20113850,"Title: Nepal climbs 5 places but continues to suffer from ills of transition.rtf; Date: September 8, 2011 Thursday; Text: KATHMANDU, Sept. 8 -- Nepal climbed 5 places and ranked 125th in the global competitiveness index out of 142 countries in 2011-12, compared to a year ago - thanks to improved macroeconomic outlook and health and primary education - two major pillars of competitiveness.
But the country still bleeds on extortion, organized crime, violence, bureaucratic maze and poor infrastructure as they have been adding huge cost to businesses, says the latest report of World Economic Forum (WEF).
Of all the factors that have been eating away country's competitiveness, Global Competitiveness Report for 2011-12 released on Wednesday tags poor infrastructure (ranked 141) as one of the key constraints to Nepal's competitiveness. Still worse, Nepal ranked last (142) on quality of electricity supply - key factor for production and competitiveness.
The report developed through global survey of top executives in 142 countries has ranked competitiveness of each country, evaluating factors like basic competitiveness, efficiency enhancers and innovation and sophistication.
Under the basic competitiveness, indicators like institutions (governance), infrastructure, macroeconomic environment and health and primary education were covered. Efficiency enhancers considered indicators like higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness and market size while the highest parameters of competitiveness evaluation included business sophistication and innovation.
In these three broad indicators, Nepal ranked 121 in basic competitiveness requirements. However, it ranked low at 127th rank in terms of efficiency enhancers and still fared badly (132th position) in terms of innovation and sophistication.
The survey reveals Nepal is least competitive among all South Asian countries, with Sri Lanka being the most competitive (ranked at 52), followed by India (at 56), Bangladesh (108) and Pakistan (118) in 2011-12.
Moreover, opinion survey that covered 102 executives from Nepal cites almost 22 percent of entrepreneurs operating in Nepal feel government instability as the most problematic factor for doing business.
As the country remained in political transition for long, top executives feel they are not confident over the protection of the property rights, including financial assets, according to the report. Protection of intellectual property remains vulnerable and irregular payments and bribes, costs of terrorism, crime and violence have been eating away competitive potentials of the country.
Of the total respondents, about 12 percent tagged inefficient government bureaucracy as second most problematic factor for doing business in Nepal. The report cites policy instability, corruption, inadequate supply of infrastructure, restrictive labor legislations, access to financing and poor ethics in national labor force as other major problems for doing business.
Regional comparison shows efficiency of labor in Nepal (rank 128) is poorest among all South Asian neighbors. And the picture is still worse when it comes to cooperation in labor-employer relations (Nepal ranks 139th among 142 countries).
The report ranks Switzerland at the top of the global ranking, followed by Singapore, Sweden, Finland and United States at the second, third, forth and fifth place. China is positioned 26th in global competitiveness ranking. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

""As of this morning, I stopped all my trucks from entering Iraq,"" Ghassan Jasim Abbel, owner of the Kuwait Falcon Co. , told The Associated Press.
Abbel said he had not yet had any contact, directly or indirectly, with the kidnappers.
Kuwait Falcon contracted with a Turkish transport company, Renay International based in Antakya, southern Turkey, for some hauls in Iraq. Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported that Renay, also was ending its Iraq work.
""Our company is ending activities in Iraq. We hope that our driver is safely returned to our country and to his family,"" Anatolia quoted Edip Rende, a partner in Renay as saying.
Anatolia identified the captured Turk as Mithat Civi, a 48-year-old father of three who had been working in Kuwait but left for Iraq a month ago.
A videotape aired Saturday on al-Arabiya television demanded Kuwait Falcon Co. cease its operations in Iraq within 48 hours or a Turkish truck driver employed by the company would be beheaded. The tape showed a man it said was the driver sitting in front of a banner with the militant group's name, the Islamic Resistance Movement-Al-Noaman Brigades, in gold lettering.
Militants waging a violent 16-month insurgency in Iraq increasingly have turned to kidnapping foreigners in an effort to drive out coalition forces and contractors.
In a separate kidnapping case last week, a tape showing three Turkish hostages being killed was sent to Al-Jazeera TV from the Tawhid and Jihad militant group, which is linked to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant held responsible for a string of bombings, kidnappings and other attacks in Iraq. Militants recently also have killed an Italian journalist and 12 Nepalese workers; seven truckers from India, Kenya and Egypt were released after their Kuwaiti employer paid a $500,000 ([euro]415,000) ransom.

 The Raj Parishad Council of State central regional conference began in Kathmandu today. The three-day conference is expected to discuss constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy; contemporary political situation and the constitutional context; the inter-relationship among the king, democracy and nationalism; and the role and responsibility of the Raj Parishad. It is also expected to discuss the improvement of backward and marginalized communities; the relevance and need for the peace zone; politicization of every sector and its unwanted impact; and the rampant corruption and ways to control it.
Radio Nepal, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 6 Dec 04
Inaugurating the conference, the Raj Parishad Standing Committee chairman, Parashu Narayan Chaudhari, said that the 1990 constitution had forced the Raj Parishad to provide advice to His Majesty if he sought it. The regional conferences were just a process of studying the situation to provide such advice to the king, he said. He also said that the conference is non-political in nature and should not be looked at with a political eye nor should anyone fear it. Chaudhari said that the Raj Parishad was not a political organization and was not involved in competition with any political organization.  Passage omitted: other details of the speech
 Chairing the inaugural function, former Prime Minister Kirti Nidhi Bista said that some people were just wasting time by demanding a reinstatement of the parliament, as that was not possible. Even if it were it would be meaningless and would create further problems, he said. Bista said that elections should take place even if it means seeking international help to do so. If Afghanistan can hold elections, so can Nepal, he said.  Omitted passages: remaining part of his speech
 Member of the council Sachit Shumsher Rana said that the monarchy was the only power that could hold the diverse people of the country together.

Dipak Gurung, 12, was killed by a bomb that went off in a public toilet near his school outside Nepal's central bank, which is about 200 metres (660 feet) from the prime minister's residence, police said.
The blast also injured Department of Labour and Employment deputy director Dhana Dhoj Basnet, police said.
A police spokesman said the Maoists set off seven bombs in quick succession near government offices.
Six people were injured outside the land revenue office at Lalitpur on Kathmandu's outskirts and five others at a similar office in another suburb, Bhaktapur, a home ministry official said.
Two people were injured in a blast outside the Kalanki government offices and another two at the Ekantakuna offices.
The Maoists have stepped up violence after they withdrew from a seven-month ceasefire last month and pulled out of peace talks because the government refused to set up a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
""It's a really sad thing that the Maoists are killing innocent people like Dipak Gurung,"" said the boy's teacher, Bhim Ghimire.
""Let them fight against the army or police for a republic or democracy, but don't kill like this.""
On Monday army sources said as many as 100 Maoist rebels could have been killed in a major battle with security forces in western Nepal.
The sources, quoting witnesses to Sunday's clash near the village of Sini in Achham district, said the bodies of 35 insurgents had been carried away, while altogether as many as 100 rebels could have been killed.
There is no way of independently verifying the death toll from the clash which took place in a remote part of the Himalayan kingdom.
Separately, the state-run Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS) news agency said one of its reporters, Gyanendra Khadka, was killed Sunday by rebels who slit his throat with a traditional curved knife, known as a khukri, in the eastern Sindhupalchowk district.
Federation of Nepal Journalists vice president Gopal Budhathoki denounced the killing.
""The murder of Gyanendra Khadka comes at a time when we are fighting for the right of journalists to report freely,"" Budhathoki said.
The Nepalese government has given special protection to 217 prominent figures said to be on a Maoist hit-list including current and former government and army officials.
An army official said extra security has also been put around telephone exchange centres and electricity distribution stations around the kingdom.
The Maoists in the past have demolished rural infrastructure projects which they argue benefit only the Kathmandu-based elite.
They have been fighting to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and to install a communist republic since 1996. The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.

Excerpt from report by Rakesh K.Singh and Somendra Sharma, carried by Indian newspaper The Asian Age website on 15 July
New Delhi/Mumbai [Bombay], 14 July: The Intelligence Bureau [IB] and state police forces have detained eight persons so far, two each from Delhi and Gujarat and four others from Maharashtra, for suspected involvement in the recent serial blasts in Mumbai.
Acting on leads provided by persons already detained, the IB has also established that two terrorists have fled to Pakistan via different routes, pointing to the use of unrelated modules for carrying out the blasts, intelligence sources said.
While a suspect, Mohammad Fayaz, went to Pakistan via Iran, an accomplice, Zuber Ansari, went to Pakistan via the porous border with Nepal after carrying out the blasts, the sources said. Ansari had been in Mumbai for over a month prior to Tuesday's [11 July] attacks, the sources said.
In Mumbai, meanwhile, the police on Thursday night arrested Mohammad Ilyas Wali Ahmed, 35, for entering the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in disguise. He was found loitering in Terminal II-A, the departure area of the airport, dressed in a burqa. ""When Ahmed arrived at the airport at around 11.15 p.m. [1745 gmt] on his motorcycle, he wore a plain shirt and pants. After a while, he was noticed in a burqa, slippers and sauntering about in the departure area. This instantly aroused our suspicion. When he refused to disclose his identity, we arrested him,"" senior police inspector Chandrahas Chavan of the Sahar police station told this reporter. Ahmed was taken to the Sahar police station for questioning.
The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) [Anti-Terrorism Squad] of the Mumbai police and the Delhi police jointly detained two persons late on Friday night. There were being interrogated, including by the IB, till the filing of this report. Their identities are yet to be established and the extent of their involvement in the Mumbai blasts is being probed, the sources said.
ATS teams fan out
ATS teams have been sent to Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat and Delhi.
Different specialised cells of the IB, including the security group, tech (technical) group and Ops (operations) group, are investigating the incident. A special group of 20 to 25 persons are analysing various leads gathered so far, the sources said.
The IB is also trying to probe the role of one Niyaz Mohammad, a Taleban operative, in the recent terror blasts. Niyaz was detained by intelligence sleuths at Indira Gandhi International Airport on the intervening night of July 8 and 9, the sources said. Niyaz, an Afghan national, was using a fake passport in the name of Islam Khan and had been in India for the last two months. Interrogation by the IB also revealed that he toured different parts of the country, including Ranchi. He was here to establish a terror network and was trying to return to Afghanistan, but was caught by the security agencies. Immigration officials have also interrogated him and have concluded that his passport was forged, the sources pointed out.
Mystery e-mail
The special cell of the Delhi police and IB are also probing an email sent to a media house in New Delhi immediately after the blasts on Tuesday. A person calling himself Javed sent the email claiming that he was part of the terror module for the Mumbai blasts and, after realising the extent of the damage, he wished to save the country, an official investigating the email said.
The sender of the email also claimed to have planted a bomb that ripped apart a train in Mumbai on Tuesday. He claimed to have been working on the specific orders of one Arjun D'Souza and signed off as a citizen of the country, sources said. The email was forwarded by the media house to the police for investigation. The police advised the media house against using the email because of its sensitive nature. The police and IB are tracing the source of the email.
Money plays big role
Intelligence agencies apprehend more such strikes in the rest of the country over the next one month following the interception of a call in which a Pakistani contact cleared 15 crore [150m] rupees [3.24m US dollars] for terrorist commanders in India for carrying out a ""month-long operation"" in the country. The sources said the blasts were an alarming pointer to the conspiracy that had been given effect by the terrorists.
The sources said money played a big role in the Mumbai blasts, as it did in the Srinagar blasts, where security forces found that youth were paid to plant bombs in different places. While terrorists are promised 1 lakh [100,000] rupees [2,000 dollars] for killing a solider, for soft targets, such as the Mumbai suburban trains, the payment could have varied from 10,000 rupees [215 dollars] to 50,000 rupees [1,080 dollars] for a person planting a bomb and 1 lakh rupees [2,170 dollars] to 2 lakhs rupees [4,330 dollars] for a group commander.

Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was reelected to head the interim government charged with overseeing an assembly election in June this year.
The Maoists enter the interim government under a peace deal struck with mainstream political parties last November.
The current interim Constitution adopted in January facilitated the Maoists' participation in the government. They have already joined the interim parliament created under the temporary charter.
In the interim government, announced by Koirala at the parliament, the former rebels have been given control of five ministries, including the Information and Communication Ministry.
Krishna Bahadur Mahara, spokesman for the Maoists, has been given the information portfolio.
Top Maoist leaders, including Chairman Prachanda, did not join the interim government.
In the interim government, Koirala has kept for himself and members of his Nepali Congress Party the key defense, interior, and finance portfolios, while the Marxist-Leninist Party, the second-largest coalition partner, takes control of foreign affairs.
There is no portfolio of deputy prime minister in the interim Cabinet, but a new Peace and Reconciliation Ministry has been established.
Koirala, 85, was unanimously reelected prime minister of the interim government by the 329-member ""parliament-legislature"" on Sunday, speaker Subash Nembang announced.
Earlier, Koirala resigned from the premiership which he had obtained in the aftermath of a popular revolt that ended King Gyanendra's direct rule in April 2006.
In brief remarks after being sworn in, Koirala called for help from all quarters in maintenance of law and order and creating a atmosphere conducive to the planned election.
The interim government is expected to announce the date of election shortly.
The Maoists are joining the government for the first time since they waged a decade-long armed insurgency that claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people.

 Kathmandu, 17 January: The government today announced it was lifting the long-standing ban on Nepali women travelling to Gulf countries for work. The announcement was made here today by Kamal Prasad Chaulagai, the minister for labour and transport management.
 ""Despite our restriction on sending women to Gulf countries, we have noticed a big outflow of Nepali women through Indian airports. We therefore have decided to allow women workers to go to Gulf countries for work,"" said the minister during a press meet at his office.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 18 Jan 03
Though a policy decision to this effect had been made, the ban would be lifted ""within a couple of weeks,"" Chaulagai said.
 Minister Chaulagai on the occasion, however, stressed that women would be allowed only to be engaged in the organized sector. Jobs as housemaid would still be restricted for Nepali women, he said.
 The ban on Nepali women travelling for work in Gulf countries was imposed in 1998 after reports of hardships and abuse emerged from returning women. However, rights groups and women's organizations have ever since argued that the ban is discriminatory and renders women unequal.
 Today, Minister Chaulagai said that the government is still concerned about violence against Nepali women abroad and would continue to monitor such cases.
 ""Any violation of rights of Nepali women from their employers abroad would now onwards be closely monitored for which the government is going to set up a mechanism,"" he said.
 Meanwhile, the minister also spoke at length on other plans to boost foreign employment opportunities for Nepali workers. Towards this end, the government is also planning to set up a separate Employment Promotion Department, added Minister Chaulagain. Additionally, a cell is to be established within the ministry to promote foreign employment.
 To minimize chances of suffering and disadvantages which the Nepali workers usually face while working abroad due mainly to lack of orientation, the ministry has also decided to restrict those foreign job-seekers that fail to attend any orientation class, he said.
 Apart from various promotional measures, the ministry would also be initiating steps to protect rights of those Nepali workers that are currently engaged in various jobs abroad. ""We will very soon appoint labour attache at least in the UAE and Malaysia, which have a large concentration of Nepalis,"" said Chaulagain.
 Much to the delight of foreign employment entrepreneurs, Minister Chaulagai also said that the government would turn the ""manpower entrepreneurs"" into ""manpower industrialists"" soon. ""With the new classification, the present entrepreneurs would enjoy additional facilities as that of industrialists, which in turn would encourage them to promote foreign employment,"" he said.
 Foreign employment is a huge source of revenues for the government as it brings in billions of rupees in remittances. However, large chunks of remittance enter the country through unauthorized route, dodging revenue. The minister said that the government is determined to control this with the assistance of the central bank.
 According to independent estimates, over 70 per cent of the total remittance enters the country through unauthorized channels.

""The ceasefire and the promise of an all-party talks have provided a ray of hope for Nepal's 11 million children, who have been increasingly affected by violence and fear, especially in these last several months,"" she said.
The Maoist insurgency, launched in 1996 to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, taken a direct toll on children, with hundreds killed and thousands orphaned, injured or traumatized, Bellamy said.
The insurgency has claimed more than 7,800 lives.
""Not even schools have provided a safe heaven for children. This is unacceptable,"" she said.
""As they gather around the negotiating table, I urge all the political parties to keep Nepal's children at the forefront of their considerations,"" she said.
""By focussing on their shared responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, leaders can find common ground and an undeniable imperative to build a lasting peace.""
Bellamy said she had been ""moved"" by private meetings she had held with Nepali children affected by the conflict.
""I was troubled by their stories and the obvious pain they've suffered, but I was even touched by the fact that none of these children expressed desire for revenge, they simply called for peace,"" she said.
Bellamy was also in Nepal to attend a two-day conference on HIV/AIDS in Kathmandu attended by health ministers and health experts from South Asian nations and Afghanistan.
She met King Gyanendra and Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.

    In Nawalparasi district, some 160 km southwest of capital  Kathmandu, activists of the Joint Madhesi Front (JMF) comprising  the Madhesi People's Rights Forum, Nepal Sadbhavana Party led by  former minister Rajendra Mahato and a few other groups clashed  with the police on Monday which left more than a dozen people  injured.
    The clash ensued after the police tried to clear the blockade  created by the agitators at the Barta section of the East-West  highway in Nawalparasi.
    The police used batons and fired 13 rounds of tear gas to  disperse the enraged protesters following the clash.
    The injured were rushed to a local hospital.
    The JMF had called for a two-day strike on Sunday to pressure  the government to immediately implement the 22-point agreement the government had reached with the MPRF.
    On Aug. 30, 2007, Nepali government and Madhesi People's Right  Forum (MPRF, also called the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, MJF)  reached a 22-point agreement in Kathmandu.
    MPRF agreed to the constitutional provisions of mixed electoral system for the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) elections and to call off its strikes. 
    Former report revealed that in return, Nepali Interim  Government would provide compensation to the families of all  Madhesi activists killed during the Madhesi movement since January, 2007 and free treatment to all the injured in the movement, and  agreed to withdraw cases against the Madhesi leaders and activists and further agreed to ensure representation of all Madhesi  minority communities in all state institutions. 
    It was also reported that Nepali government agreed to a federal structure with autonomous states without affecting national  sovereignty and integrity, and agreed to give national recognition to dress, language and culture of the Madhesi communities,  sanction public holidays during Muslim festivals and formulate  laws to protect people's religious rights, provide free education  up to primary level to Madhesis, give preferential treatment to  Madhesis in education and employment and provide land to the  landless within the Madhes region.
    Madhesi people are the Nepalese living in the south Terai  plains (also called Madhes region), most of which are culturally  close to the bordering Indian people.

Text of report in English by South Korean news agency Yonhap
SEOUL, March 19 (Yonhap) - A group of South Koreans and migrant workers held a candlelight vigil on Wednesday night to extend sympathy to the Tibetan people under China's rule and denounce the ongoing crackdown on their independence movement.
""The world knows. Tibetans are not an ethnic minority of China,"" Tenzing, 31, a migrant worker of Tibetan descent from Nepal, who goes by only one name, said during a rally near Gwanghwamun, a major intersection in downtown Seoul.
""China says Tibet is an ethnic minority, and then it's destroying the culture, the language and everything of Tibet. It wants only the Chinese culture to prevail,"" he said.
Brushing off the biting cold winds of early spring, the group of about 40 people sat down on the street, waved a Tibetan flag and chanted slogans - ""Free Tibet"" and ""Stop killing"" - in the Korean, English and Tibetan languages. Many Koreans said they could relate to the Tibetans, with the ongoing crackdown in Tibet evoking their historical pain from the 1980 Gwangju Democracy Movement and the 1910-45 colonial rule by Japan.
""Hearing the Chinese announcements, I thought 'How they could say all the same things as the Korean government said in 1980?'"" Oh Gi-yeol, a Tibetan language teacher in Seoul, said, referring to the democracy uprising in the southern city of Gwangju. The Korean military regime at that time called the protesters rebels, denied that its military used lethal force, and banned foreign and local journalists from entering the city.
""It seems that those who want to steal promote all the same public causes,"" he said.
Migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries called for solidarity among other Asian people, calling China ""the United States in Asia."" Those from Burma, also called Myanmar, said the Tibetan crisis resonates with the situation at home, where the democracy movement is suppressed by the military junta with support from the Chinese government.
""China supports the Burmese government, rather than the democracy activists, as that serves its assimilation policy,"" Thu Ra, president of Burma Action Korea, a group of Burmese activists in South Korea, said.
""The Tibetan cause is not just about Tibet, but it's about the Asian region,"" he said, ""I came here to offer small help, believing that we should join hands to stop China from 'China-izing' Asia.""
The protesters called on Beijing to give greater autonomy to Tibet, over which the Chinese government has exercised control since 1950, when its troops invaded the region. China claims that Tibet had been part of its territory for a long time before the invasion.
Tibet's government-in-exile has put the death toll from the week-long unrest at 99. China has rejected the death toll, saying only 16 were killed.
A group of human rights and Buddhist organizations in Seoul, such as the Centre for South Korea-Tibet Community and the Korean House for International Solidarity, marched in protest to the Chinese embassy on Tuesday.
The Chinese embassy in Seoul defended Beijing's crackdown on the Tibetan protest.
""As you might have seen on television, the separatists are attacking Chinese institutions and schools. They are using violence, but our government is not using violence in response to them,"" Car Yan-bong, an embassy spokesman, said by telephone on Tuesday.

"6823",20082240,"Title: Nepal 's Maoists take a wary step out of India -China shadow.rtf; Date: September 20, 2008 Saturday 1:32 AM GMT; Text: Landlocked, impoverished Nepal has always struggled to punch above its diplomatic weight, but its new Maoist leader has lost no time in shaking up ties with giant neighbours India and China.
In office for barely a month, Prime Minister Prachanda, a former warlord,  has already visited both countries, signalling his desire for closer ties with Beijing and a stronger voice in dealings with traditional ally New Delhi.
In an apparently calculated snub to India, Prachanda broke with long-standing precedent by visiting China first.
Past Nepali leaders have always made New Delhi their first port of call and Prachanda's move ruffled official feathers in India which is extremely wary of any regional shift that might complicate its difficult relations with China.
""His China visit broke a long tradition and sent a message that the Maoist-led government wants to change position,"" said Gunaraj Luitel, an editor with New Republic, an English language daily in Nepal.
Although Prachanda insisted that his attendance at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games did not constitute an ""official"" visit, he did meet with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.
His subsequent official visit to India was a warm one, but on his return to Kathmandu, Prachanda explicitly laid out Nepal's aspirations for a diplomatic realignment.
""In the past Nepal has had closer connections with India ... I am of the view that Nepal will now build equal relations with both neighbours,"" said the prime minister, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal but who prefers his nom-de-guerre Prachanda, meaning ""the fierce one"".
While in New Delhi, Prachanda also pushed for the re-negotiation of a treaty that has governed bilateral relations for more than half a century.
Many Nepalis argue that the 1950 Indo-Nepal pact allows India an excessive say in their country's political and economic affairs -- most notably a clause preventing Nepal buying arms and weapons from a third country without Indian permission.
Some analysts say Prachanda's efforts to project the image abroad of a more assertive Nepal are largely aimed at appeasing nationalist sentiment at home, and that his overtures towards China are little more than an unsubtle bid to gain more leverage in dealings with India.
""Playing India off against China ... has never really worked in the past,"" said one Western diplomat here.
The fact is that Nepal's landlocked status makes it hugely dependent on India, which supplies all of the Himalayan nation's oil products and the vast bulk of its consumer goods.
This severely restricts Prachanda's room for manoeuvre, and provoking any serious rift with New Delhi could result in a repeat of the crippling economic blockade imposed by India in the late 1980s following a dispute over transit rights.
""The Maoist-led government may try to decrease Indian dominance in Nepal but it won't happen anytime soon because we are not yet politically stable and we are economically dependent,"" said researcher and political analyst Basker Gautam.
Gautam also suggested that the new prime minister's pro-China leanings were partly motivated by a desire to underline his party's ""revolutionary image"".
For the 20,000 exiled Tibetans living in Nepal, however, they pose a very real threat. Last week, the Nepalese Ministry said any Tibetan who did not have any official refugee papers would be deported.
The move followed large protests by the exiles in Kathmandu over a Chinese crackdown in Tibet.
""This is one area where the new government has made a change to keep China happy,"" said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the weekly magazine, Samay.

"3436",20044896,"Title: New U.N. resolution calls for tough measures to prevent use of child soldiers.rtf; Date: April 23, 2004, Friday, BC cycle; Text: The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution calling for tough measures to prevent the recruitment and use of child soldiers after Chechnya and Northern Ireland were dropped from a list of ""armed conflicts"" where youngsters are given weapons to fight.
The resolution had been held up for months, initially because Britain objected to the inclusion of Northern Ireland paramilitary groups on a list of armed groups called on to halt the practice, and then because Russia objected to the inclusion of Chechen insurgency groups. Both nations rejected the use of the term ""armed conflicts"" to refer to the disputes.
The resolution adopted Thursday calls for armed groups in six civil wars on the council's agenda - Afghanistan, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Congo, Liberia and Somalia - to prepare ""concrete time-bound action plans"" within three months in cooperation with U.N. experts to halt their recruitment and use of child soldiers.
The Security Council said it would consider imposing ""targeted and graduated measures"" such as an arms embargo or ban on military assistance on armed groups that refuse to start a dialogue, adopt an action plan, and implement it.
The resolution is based on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last November which said children are being recruited and used as soldiers ""on a massive scale"" around the world, with groups in 15 civil wars handing weapons to youngsters.
Despite international efforts to ensure that children under the age of 18 do not take part in hostilities, the report named 22 new groups found to be recruiting or using children as fighters, along with three dozen previously identified groups.
In addition to the six civil wars on the Security Council's agenda, it listed nine other ""armed conflicts"" not on the council's agenda where parties recruit or use children - Chechnya, Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, Northern Ireland, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Uganda.
To satisfy British demands, a correction was issued on Feb. 20 stating that the situation in Northern Ireland ""is not an armed conflict within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions."" The same correction was issued Monday at Russia's insistence, along with a change in the name of those recruiting children to ""Chechen illegal armed groups"" - not ""Chechen insurgency groups.""
The resolution adopted Thursday calls on ""parties in other situations of armed conflict"" mentioned in Annan's report to halt the recruitment and use of children immediately and expresses the council's intention ""to consider taking appropriate steps to further address this issue.""
Since Chechnya and Northern Ireland are no longer considered ""armed conflicts,"" however, this would not apply to groups there - only to the groups named in the report from Colombia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Uganda.
The resolution makes no general call for an end to the use of child soldiers. It strongly condemns the recruitment and use of child soldiers ""by parties to armed conflict"" and other abuses against youngsters caught in fighting including abduction and sexual violence.
It asks Annan to develop a system to monitor and report on the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and to propose measures to control cross-border abductions, recruitment, and illicit trade in natural resources and weapons, preferably within three months.

"3054",20043986,"Title: In F.B.I., Innocent Detainee Found Unlikely Ally.rtf; Date: June 30, 2004 Wednesday; Text: Late Edition - Final
It took no more than a week for James P. Wynne, a veteran F.B.I. investigator, to confirm the harmless truth that only now, more than two years later, he is ready to talk about. The small foreign man he helped arrest for videotaping outside an office building in Queens on Oct. 25, 2001, was no terrorist. 
 He was a Buddhist from Nepal planning to return there after five years of odd jobs at places like a Queens pizzeria and a Manhattan flower shop. He was taping New York street scenes to take back to his wife and sons in Katmandu. And he had no clue that the tall building that had drifted into his viewfinder happened to include an office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
  Yet by the time Mr. Wynne filed his F.B.I. report a few days later, the Nepalese man, who spoke almost no English, had been placed in solitary confinement at a federal detention center in Brooklyn just because of his videotaping. He was swallowed up in the government's new maximum security system of secret detention and secret hearings, and his only friend was the same F.B.I. agent who had helped decide to put him there.
 Except for the videotape -- ''a tourist kind of thing,'' in Mr. Wynne's estimation -- no shred of suspicion attached to the man, Purna Raj Bajracharya, 47, who came from Nepal in 1996. His one offense -- staying to work on a long-expired tourist visa -- was an immigration violation punishable by deportation, not jail. But he wound up spending three months in solitary confinement before he was sent back to Katmandu in January 2002, and to release him from his shackles, even Mr. Wynne needed help. 
 The clearance process had become so byzantine that the officer who had set the procedure in motion could not hasten it. Unable to procure a release that officially required signatures from top antiterrorism officials in Washington, Mr. Wynne took an uncommon step for an F.B.I. agent: he called the Legal Aid Society for a lawyer to help the jailed man.
 Now, for the first time, the F.B.I. agent and the Legal Aid lawyer, Olivia Cassin, have agreed to talk about the case and their unlikely alliance. Their documented accounts offer a rare, firsthand window into the workings of a secret world. 
 Within 10 days of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Justice Department instructed immigration judges that all cases designated as ''special interest'' were to be handled in separate closed courtrooms, without visitors, family or reporters, and without confirming whether a case was on the docket. The secrecy left detainees with little access to lawyers.
 Visa violators would be held indefinitely, until the F.B.I. was sure the person was not involved in terrorism. As a visa violator under suspicion, Mr. Bajracharya was among hundreds placed in the special interest category, and his case was wiped from the public record. 
 Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said that though he was unfamiliar with the case, the system of secrecy Mr. Bajracharya encountered is lawful and necessary. ''The idea that someone who has violated our immigration laws may be of interest on a national security level as well is an unfortunate reality, post-9/11,'' he said. Closed hearings are legal as long as due process is provided, he said, and all abuses will be dealt with.
 But Ms. Cassin, of Legal Aid, argues that under this secret practice, there is no way to know whether other noncitizens are even now being unfairly detained. ''By its very nature,'' she said, ''it can happen again without our knowing about it.'' 
 Mr. Bajracharya was finally returned to Nepal on Jan. 13, 2002. By then he had spent almost three months in a 6-by-9-foot cell kept lighted 24 hours a day. The unit of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he was kept has become notorious for the abuses documented there by the Justice Department's own inspector general, who found a pattern of physical and mental mistreatment of post-9/11 detainees. Videotapes showed officers slamming detainees into walls, mocking them during unnecessary strip-searches, and secretly taping their conversations with lawyers.
 Mr. Wynne would not comment on detention policies, and said that he should not be ''held out as the one lone person who did the right thing.'' But during an extended interview approved by his F.B.I. superiors, he read aloud from phone logs documenting desperate messages from the man's family in Katmandu, his efforts to reassure the weeping detainee, and his own dawning recognition that no resolution was in sight.
 ''I told Purna that I would try to help him, that I wouldn't forget about him,'' Mr. Wynne explained. ''I felt some -- not responsibility, but I felt that there was no one else.'' 
 By telephone from Katmandu, Mr. Bajracharya recalled the fear, humiliation and despair he had experienced in prison. ''I had nothing but tears in my eyes,'' he said through a translator. ''The only thing I knew, I was innocent, but I didn't know what w"
"6353",20072955,"Title: King out, Everest in for new Nepal bills.rtf; Date: February 9, 2007 Friday 12:39 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's government said Friday has decided to replace the image of embattled King Gyanendra with an image of Everest, the world's highest mountain, on 10 rupee (13 cent) bills.
The decision comes amid moves to remove the unpopular king from public view ahead of an election scheduled for this year that will decide the makeup of a constitutional council to determine the fate of the 238-year-old monarchy once and for all.
""The cabinet meeting on Thursday decided to replace the king's picture with the picture of Mount Everest on 10 rupee bills,"" Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat told AFP.
Late last month, a finance ministry spokesman said the government planned to remove the monarch's image from all denominations and replace it with ""images of national figures,"" like the Buddha or the Himalayas.
""We have not taken any decisions on what images will go on the other denominations yet,"" Mahat said.
Gyanendra was forced to end his absolute control of the country in April last year after massive protests organized by sidelined political parties and rebel Maoists.
Since then, the king has had his executive powers removed, as well as his control of the 90,000-strong Nepal Army.
Late last year, the Maoists and government signed a peace deal obliging the former rebels to place their arms and armies under UN supervision. In return, the fiercely republican leftists have been granted 83 seats in a new 330-seat, interim parliament.

King Gyanendra had fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in October 2002 for ""incompetence"" and handpicked a new government, but reappointed Deuba on June 2 after months of pro-democracy protests.
Deuba, however, has been unable to bring any parties other than his own into the government as they insist the king must explicitly renounce any role larger than a constitutional monarch.
Deuba told a student conference that the king had approved a bill presented by the government to restore the full rights of the cabinet, which at present has only three members.
""The decision of the council of ministers that it should be vested with its executive rights has been approved by the king,"" Deuba said.
A cabinet official said the move meant the cabinet would be able to appoint and dismiss public servants, including officers in the military, whose supreme commander is King Gyanendra.
""With the restoration of executive rights, the other political parties should join the Deuba government at the earliest,"" the official said.
Gyanendra in his June 2 announcement of Deuba's reappointment also said he planned to give the government ""executive rights"" but the king has not expressed regret for dismissing the elected leadership in 2002.
The king had accused Deuba two years ago of failing to put down Maoist rebels, who are fighting to overthrow the monarchy and have taken over much of the countryside.
Deuba has appealed to political parties to join the government so it can relaunch a peace process with the Maoists, who have rejected calls for talks with the reappointed premier.

The flooding in South Asia caused by the June-to-September monsoon has been described as the worst in decades, with more than 2,200 people killed by floods and rains in India since it started.
In neighbouring Bangladesh, the number of people killed by flooding topped 1,000 on Saturday, the government said.
Monsoon-swollen rivers have burst their banks, submerging thousands of villages across more than a third of the impoverished country, the Bangladesh flood centre said.
The floods have hit about 10,000 villages in India's northeastern Assam state, where three people died in landslides triggered by pounding rains, taking the death toll since July in the region to 77.
""The overall situation is still grim with an estimated 11 million people displaced by floods since July,"" state rehabilitation minister Bhumidhar Barman told AFP.
The Brahmaputra river was flowing above the danger mark in 17 places in the tea-and-mineral-rich state.
On Saturday, five people were hurt when the propellers of a relief helicopter caused a freak ""storm-like situation"" that knocked down 25 huts, another official said.
""So many people have lost their homes and these are mostly the poorest of the poor,"" said Vinoy Ohdar, who heads anti-poverty agency ActionAid's office in the eastern Indian state of Bihar.
Bihar is still recovering from flooding earlier in the monsoon season that affected 15 million people.
Bangladesh's agriculture ministry said crops worth at least 290 million dollars had been damaged in the flooding.
The government flood centre said the flood situation would improve in northern districts but the receding water would submerge more areas in the central and southern region.
The devastation in India also threatens an entire season's crops in some areas, raising fears of food shortages.
Flood victims have also been suffering from diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases, with clean water in short supply.
Bangladesh has sought an initial 150 million dollars from donor agencies with 60 million dollars already pledged in immediate food and medical help.
In Nepal, landslides and floods have killed at least 185 people since the start of monsoon, the home ministry said.

Text of report by privately-owned Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via eKantipur website on 2 July
Kathmandu, 2 July: Two major coalition partners - UCPN (Maoist) and CPN-UML - failed to find common ground on government policy and programmes owing to differences over providing relief package to the family members of those bracketed as martyrs by the Maoists.
The Maoists have urged Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal and Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari to incorporate their demand in the government policy document, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament on Sunday [3 July].
Each family of the ""martyrs"" should be given 900,000 rupees aside from adequate compensation to the wounded cadres.
The Maoist-led government in 2008 had declared it would provide 100,000 rupees to family members of martyrs. Of them, only a few family members of those killed in the decade long insurgency received the relief. According to the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, some 13,000 Maoist cadres were killed by the state and the Maoists killed 3000 individuals. The Maoists have proposed that the state provide compensation to their kin.
""There should be relief packages for family members of the disappeared, murdered and wounded leaders and cadres,"" said Maoist Vice-Chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who was present in the two rounds of bilateral talks.
The Maoists have also demanded special programmes for conflict-hit districts.
Gorkha, Rukum, Jajarkot, Rolpa, Sindhuli and Salyan are recognised as base areas of the Maoist war.
The demand put forth by the Maoist party has made the prime minister postpone Friday's talks for Saturday. Two rounds of talks held at the prime minister's office ended without concrete decision.
""The Maoists have been demanding relief package for their cadres,"" a UML minister said.
A Maoist minister said Finance Minister Adhikari has been denying incorporating Maoist demands including relief package to the conflict victims.
""The budget is not only a matter of introducing and using as per the necessity of coalition partners. The government wants to incorporate the demands of the main opposition parties too,"" said the minister.
Minister for Prime Minister's Office Affairs Ghanshyam Bhusal said more discussions were needed for understanding between the ruling and opposition parties. ""We have not yet started preparing the draft. Most probably, tomorrow's meeting will give some headway,"" said Bhusal.

Kathmandu, 3 June: Central leader of the Communist Party of Nepal- Unified Marxist Leninist Janardan Sharma (Prabhakar) has disclosed that the seven party alliance and the Maoists during their 12-point agreement had agreed to revive the House of Representatives for seven days at the most.
The House of Representatives has not been dissolved even after 35 days of its revival. It violates the agreement, the Maoist leader said.
Speaking at an interaction held by Reporters Club in the capital, Prabhakar said, ""It was agreed during the finalization of the 12-point agreement that the House of Representatives would be revived for two to seven days' time and go for the process of constituent assembly.""
Prabhakar, who is also the western regional commander of the Maoists, said that the Maoists were ahead of the government to declare ceasefire, form talks team and putting forward political agenda. He charged that the government was lagging behind to take such decisions. The government should explain the people the reason of such delays. Prabhakar said that it is not possible to lay down arms until new constitution and government are formed.
""We cannot hand over arms until the election of the constituent assembly is held, new constitution is written and a new government is formed,"" said Prabhakar.
President of People's Front Nepal Amik Serchan said that the peaceful meetings and demonstrations have posed hurdles for national and international power centres.
Leader of the Communist Party of Nepal- Unified Marxist Leninist Yuba Raj Gyawali said that his party was working to go for constituent assembly through an interim constitution.
Government negotiator Ramesh Lekhak said that the sole aim of the government is to hold the election of the constituent assembly.

Two weeks of bloody opposition protests and a general strike against the rule of King Gyanendra have paralyzed Nepal, leaving the country at its most volatile since the monarch seized power 14 months ago. At least 10 people have been killed during the demonstrations.
Officials claimed security forces in Chandragadi, about 310 miles southeast of Katmandu, opened fire after being shot at by protesters, who also hurled bricks and debris. The government has made similar claims during the past two weeks, but those accounts have not been confirmed independently.
The region's chief administrator, Bhola Siwakoti, also said the protesters defied a ban in the town and were sacking government and private property.
The were conflicting reports of how many were killed. The Defense Ministry said two people were dead, but another Nepali official said four were killed and a U.N. official said five were killed. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the sensitivity of the situation.
The latest deaths bring to at least 10 the number of people killed by security forces during the protests. Since the opposition campaign began April 6, ordinary Nepalis have joined rallies alongside students and political activists.
The royal government has responded harshly, claiming that Nepal's communist insurgents who are allied with the political opposition had violently infiltrated the rallies. Police have beaten, tear gassed and arrested thousands of protesters.
""Democratic rights do not exist,"" said Ian Martin, Nepal-based representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""The opportunities for peaceful protests have been closed down.""
So far, he said, close to 4,000 people have been arrested, and about 700 are still detained.
The king dismissed an interim government and seized power in February 2005, claiming a need to restore order and crush a communist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people over the past decade.
Many of Nepal's 27 million people initially welcomed the king's power grab because they were fed up with the corrupt and squabbling political elite. But the worsening communist insurgency and a faltering economy have fueled discontent.
Hours before Wednesday's shootings, the royal government freed two top opposition leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal and Ram Chandra Poudel of the Nepali Congress who had been jailed for three months.
No reasons were given for their release, and both pledged to join the protests.
""We will launch the protest (against the king) in an effective way until full sovereignty is returned to the people,"" Kumar Nepal told reporters.
Many here saw the releases as an attempt by Gyanendra to show flexibility on the day an Indian special envoy arrived to press him to compromise with the opposition.
""I am always optimistic,"" said envoy Karan Singh, who began talks with the opposition Wednesday and was to meet Gyanendra on Thursday.
Later Wednesday, the government imposed an 18-hour curfew in Katmandu and surrounding areas an attempt to scuttle opposition plans to bring 100,000 people Thursday onto the ring road skirting the capital. Such a rally would dwarf all earlier ones.
The government said the curfew would run from 2 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday in Katmandu, the suburb of Lalitpur and in areas 650 feet beyond both.
On Wednesday morning, the government imposed a daylong curfew in the resort town of Pokhara, the scene of daily protests the past two weeks. Security forces were ordered to shoot violators on sight.
Despite the curfew, some 250 professors took to the streets of Pokhara and were arrested.
There also were protests of a few thousand people each in Katmandu.
The United States, meanwhile, again urged Gyanendra to restore democracy, with White House press secretary Scott McClellan saying in Washington that the unrest in the country ""will only worsen.""
""Arrests and violence accompanying the pro-democracy demonstrations only add to the insecurity and compound the serious problem facing Nepal,"" he told reporters.
The royal government summoned U.S. Ambassador James Moriarty on Tuesday to protest the envoy's remarks that the king could end up fleeing the Himalayan nation if he did not compromise with the opposition.
Aside from the protests, the strike has closed shops and forced vehicles off the streets and highways for 14 straight days, causing shortages of food and other necessities in Katmandu.

"4150",20051871,"Title: Report_ Indian police arrest three suspected communist guerrillas from Nepal.rtf; Date: June 19, 2005 Sunday; Text: Indian police on Sunday arrested three suspected communist rebels from Nepal who had sought medical treatment in India, a report said.
Acting on a tip, police raided a house rented by the suspected guerrillas in Nawtolia, a town in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
The three were wounded in a recent battle with Nepal's army, PTI quoted local police as saying.
The Maoist Communist Center, a militant group that operates in five southern and eastern Indian states, supports the communist insurgency in Nepal, which has killed more than 11,500 people in the Himalayan state since 1996.
Last week, local police arrested another suspected rebel from Nepal at a private hospital where he was being treated for injuries.
Officials in Nawtolia, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of New Delhi, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Travel is quite easy between the two countries as Indians and Nepalese don't need passports to cross the long, porous border.
Nepal has complained that communist rebels take refuge in the bordering Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal after carrying out attacks on government forces in the Himalayan nation.
In India, communist rebels often attack police, landlords and politicians in what they say is a fight for the rights of the poor.

"2226",20044870,"Title: Nepal gov't says no party mediation in peace talks soon.rtf; Date: August 4, 2004 Wednesday 200408040856; Text: The Nepalese government said Wednesday it is keen to make one more attempt at direct peace talks with Maoist rebels fighting an armed insurgency in the kingdom before requesting third-party mediation.
 'We want one more shot at talks by ourselves (the government and the rebels) and call in the third party later if need be,' Information and Communication Minister Mohammad Mohsin, who is also the top government spokesman, told reporters.
 While this does not mean the government is not open to third-party mediation in a new round of dialogue, the planned third round of talks with the rebels would begin without a third party, the minister said.
The minister was explaining the government's position amid reports of concern shown by the United Nations on Nepal's ongoing conflict as well as its offer to mediate in restoring the peace process.
 According to reports in the local media, two senior U.N. officials are visiting Nepal later this week to explore ways of initiating a new round of dialogue.
 The minister also expressed skepticism over the outcome of peace talks held with U.N. involvement, saying, 'The U.N. too is no panacea. They have had problems in resolving conflicts elsewhere.'
 The most the government can offer at this juncture is U.N. involvement after the two parties commence the round, Mohsin said.
 The rebels have said no peace parley is possible with the current government headed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, but would consider negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.
 Rebels walked out of the second round of peace negotiations last August after the government declined to consider their demand of revoking the Constitution of 1990, which provides for parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy.
 Meanwhile, insurgency-related violence continues to hound the country, with the rebels killing two army soldiers Wednesday in an ambush in Lamjung district in central Nepal, about 90 kilometers southwest of the capital. The rebels also shot dead an assistant police inspector in Morang district Wednesday, local media reports said.

King Gyanendra replaced eight ministers, including some controversial figures, and put in place members of the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra, or National Democratic Party.
Gyanendra removed a home minister who was blamed for security lapses last week when the motorcade of Crown Prince Paras was hit by stones from protesters. The minister for women and social welfare, who allegedly had been found misusing state property, also was dismissed.
Both were replaced with royalist ministers. Nepal has 36 ministers and junior ministers.
Maoist rebels last month announced a 12-point agreement to work with Nepal's major political parties to pressure Gyanendra to restore democracy in this Hindu nation of about 27 million people bordered by China and India.
The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and the civil war has killed about 12,000 people.
The king seized absolute power Feb. 1, suspending civil liberties, jailing hundreds of politicians and activists and banning criticism of the government and security forces. He said the move was necessary to fight the insurgency and reduce corruption but he has faced wide criticism and ongoing street protests.
The Maoists announced last week they would extend their three-month unilateral cease-fire by another month. They said the move would increase the chance of achieving peace in Nepal.
The rebels have stopped major attacks but have continued to skirmish with government troops and kidnap people for indoctrination.
Wednesday's announcement came after Gyanendra's return from a three-week tour of Africa.

The rebels were meeting in the jungle in Parsa, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of the capital, Katmandu, when soldiers surrounded the camp around midnight.
The 19 rebels killed in a three-hour gunbattle that followed, police officials said on condition of anonymity.
The army reported no casualties.
The guerrillas, who say they're inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state.
More than 8,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Fighting has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August.

Cadres of All Nepal Trade Union Federation (ANTUF) assaulted Shailendra Lal Pradhan, the owner of Shree Textiles, after the latter refused to allow workers to participate in the awareness program.
According to Pradhan, a group of 40-50 workers carrying banner and flags of ANTUF barged into the factory and physically assaulted him. He said the workers were affiliated with ANTUF's Lalitpur Unit 2 committee.
""They aggressively thrashed me after I refused to send my workers to attend their program. Activities like this deteriorate investment climate in the country,"" said Pradhan, who is also the president of Nepal Plastic Manufacturers' Association.
FNCCI President Kush Kumar Joshi condemned the incident in strong words and warned that the business people would be forced to close industries across the country if the government failed to bring the culprits to book within a week. ""How can we continue industrial activities amid violent activities of workers and non-cooperative attitude of the government?"" Joshi wondered.
Ganesh Regmi, central general secretary of ANTUF, however, denied the involvement of his cadres in the incident. ""This is just an attempt to distract the ongoing negotiations between representatives of trade unions and FNCCI,"" Regmi added.
Meanwhile, Lalitpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Patan Industrial Estate Welfare and Security Committee and Nepal Industrial Estate Industry Federation have condemned the incident.

Sources said there was a sense of discomfort during the meeting between Prachanda, who used to criticize the army chief in public functions by name, and the army chief, who is known for his anti-Maoist remarks. During the meeting that lasted for about half an hour, Prachanda had repeatedly asked about the army's organizational structure.

He claimed that the front took to an armed struggle after the government blocked its path while carrying out an ideological movement. He denied that the front's activities such as killings and abductions were directed against hill people living in Terai [southern plains] and would hurt communal harmony. ""This government has not been able to even touch the issue of rights of the Madhesis [indigenous people of Terai]. We are not killers of hill people. We are not murderers,"" he said. ""We are engaged in an armed struggle against a unitary hill people-dominated state authority, and the struggle intends to exert pressure.""
He also warned of intensifying the struggle if the government adopts a policy of suppression. He believes hill people have been exploiting the Madhesis on communal grounds for the last 238 years. The front is not in favour of disrupting communal harmony and splitting the Terai, he said. ""We have launched an armed struggle to ensure our rights,"" he said.
Claiming that it was wrong to think that a faction led by him had split from the front led by Jayakrishna Goit, he said: ""The front has not split. Its first general convention honoured him (Goit) and because of his advanced age and ill heath I was given the responsibility as chairman. However, there is some difference of opinion in the leadership.""
Asked whether acts of abducting hill people and releasing them in exchange for ransoms were not similar in nature to the robberies that take place in Bihar [India], he said: ""We have not arrested or abducted hill people. We have only captured those people in Terai who deprive us of our rights. We don't release them for ransom but by charging fines and taxes.""

The front made its demands public on 4 January.

Text of report by Nepalnews.com website on 12 June
The government has decided to withdraw all the cases filed under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance (TADO) and not to file cases under this ordinance.
The meeting of the council of ministers held Monday morning [12 June] at the prime minister's residence at Baluwatar took the decision to this effect.
Talking to Nepalnews, Spokesperson of the Home Ministry Baman Prasad Neupane said that the government made the decision to withdrew cases filed under TADO and not to file cases under the TADO.
The decision was made to release Maoist detainees, who were detained under TADO at a time Maoists are pressurizing the government to release all political detainees before the second round of talks.
The TADO allowed security forces to detain persons accused of terrorism for a year without taking them to court. The ordinance had permitted such detention for 90 days when it was first promulgated in 2002.
The TADO is due to expire on the third week of October.
Earlier, reports had said that the cabinet scrapped the TADO with effect from Monday.
Speaking at a programme in the capital on Monday Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara informed that more than 350 Maoist cadres are being detained under TADO and will be released soon.
Likewise, the cabinet also took decision to form a Media Council under the chairmanship of the member of the National Assembly and senior advocate Radheshyam Adhikari.
Members of the council will include president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ), coordinator of Save the Independent Radio Movement (SIRM), and presidents of Nepal Press Union, Press Chautari Nepal and Sancharika Samuha. The director-general of the Information Department is member secretary of the council. The council will hand over its first report after two months.
The government also decided to appoint Kul Chanda Wagle, former president of Nepal Press Union, as the advisor at the Ministry of Information and Communication.
Similarly, the cabinet meeting finalized regulations regarding functioning of the council of ministers, radio reports said. It is expected to be tabled at today's session of the parliament, after which the parliament will be in recess.
On the occasion, Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula informed the cabinet about his meeting with Maoist chairman Prachanda on Sunday.

The shooting occurred Wednesday in the village of Kasenyi, where U.N. peacekeepers were searching for a group of militiamen who local residents claimed were planning to attack a local market, said Leocadio Salmeron, spokesman for the U.N.'s Congo mission at Bunia, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the west.
""As they were retreating, the militiamen opened fire on part of our battalion, wounding one officer,"" Salmeron said. The U.N. troops returned fire.
""He was lightly wounded. It was nothing serious,"" Salmeron added.
Peacekeepers immediately surrounded the area, detaining 13 militiamen along with several Kalashnikov assault rifles and ammunition discovered in a house.
In a separate incident on Wednesday, Salmeron said, armed militiamen in Kasenyi stopped a riverboat carrying 20 tons of food for the German-based aid group Welthungerhilfe, or Agro Action. The militiamen loaded two sacks of corn onto a canoe and fled.
On Feb. 12, a U.N. military observer from Kenya was shot dead while investigating reports of fighting between rival tribal factions in the northeast. He was the fourth member of the U.N. mission to die in Congo since the United Nations began deploying troops to the vast country in November 1999.
Tribal militias in northeastern Ituri province - mainly minority ethnic Hemas and majority Lendus - have continued to battle each other despite the presence of around 4,700 U.N. peacekeepers and military observers in the region.
The peacekeepers are in Ituri to stabilize the province and protect residents, U.N. staff and aid workers from tribal fighting in which at least 50,000 people have been killed and 500,000 others forced to flee their home since 1999.
The Hema and Lendu traditionally fought for land and other resources, but formed murderous militias when they were armed by neighboring Uganda and Rwanda during the six-nation war that broke out in Congo that began in 1998.
The U.N. peacekeepers include troops from Bangladesh, Uruguay, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia and India.

Text of report by Radio Nepal on 11 April
[Presenter] Minister of State for Information and Communications Srish Shumsher Rana has said that the seven party agitation is not peaceful as being claimed by the parties and that the parties are bent on creating an abnormal situation in the country. The government's claim about Maoist involvement in the agitation has come out to be true, Rana said, and added that working together with terrorists and organizing agitations would not provide a resolution to the problems. Rana said that the government was alert regarding the present awkward situation in the country.
[Rana] The parties first said they will give continuity to their agitation. Then came a statement published by terrorists saying that they too are involved in it. The statement was published several days ago. [And it has led to] a duet that has been going on about who owns the agitation. On our part, we have remained steadfast in our stance - that terrorists have infiltrated the seven-party agitation. Guns were fired from the back [of a demonstrating crowd] right here in Gongabu [in Kathmandu]. [Similar firing was witnessed] in Tandi [of Chitwan] yesterday. Today in Banepa [neighbouring town of Kathmandu Valley]. Such is the situation, which is not normal. And in these abnormal times we have been trying to mobilize the police in some places, declaring curfews in others, all for the sake of providing protection to people's life and property so that the losses borne are minimal. We are treading with care.
[Presenter] Rana said that there was no change in the way the government viewed the seven parties but promised that the government would fulfil its responsibility if the agitation went out of control. The curfew, he said, was a measure forced upon the government but that it would be gradually lifted as the situation turned to normal. He said that the government would not bow down to terrorism. He appealed to the mass media to cooperate in bringing the situation to normal. Rana also clarified that the government had made arrangements for media persons to do their work without hindrance.

Eve Conant has written about foreign policy, science and health for Newsweek and other magazines.
In a deeply disturbing essay in The New York Review of Books in 1990, the economist and future Nobel laureate Amartya Sen laid bare some brutal math. Because of biological advantages in fighting disease, women typically outnumbered men in fully developed countries, with about 105 women for every 100 men. And yet in developing countries like China and India, there were only about 94 women for every 100 men. The women seemed to have vanished into thin air. What was happening? As a first step toward unraveling the mystery, Sen decided to compute how many women would have been alive in parts of Asia and North Africa had their countries' sex ratios matched those of the developed West. The math shocked the world: more than 100 million women were missing.
Sen did not tell sensational stories about newborn girls being left out in the cold or of freezing buckets of water by the birthing bed. He simply wrote that his numbers told ''a terrible story of inequality and neglect leading to the excess mortality of women.'' But his calculations helped shape a widespread assumption that misogynistic abuses were rife in Eastern societies -- ranging from infanticide to fatally neglectful health and dietary care. While the 100 million figure was subsequently lowered to 60 million by the Princeton demographer Ansley J. Coale, Sen's findings continue to guide the work of governments and NGO's to this day.
  But what if something else, beyond a preference for sons, was responsible for the ''missing women''? In the summer of 2004, a 24-year-old Harvard graduate student in economics named Emily Oster was reading Baruch S. Blumberg's book ''Hepatitis B: The Hunt for a Killer Virus.'' Oster, a tireless number-cruncher, has published research on everything from the decision-making of Powerball players to the correlation between witch trials and rotten weather in Medieval Europe. She was intrigued by several small-scale studies in the Blumberg book that suggested that if either parent was a carrier of the hepatitis B virus, the couple were more likely to have male children. What if nature, wondered Oster, and not the lack of nurture, was behind Sen's 100 million missing women?
  At the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Oster began searching for data on hepatitis B and sex ratios. She found that among Alaska natives in the 1970's, there were both a high rate of hepatitis B and an overwhelming number of boys born. With the help of statisticians, she confirmed that when the hepatitis B vaccination became available in Alaska in the early 80's, the gender balance was restored. Inspired, Oster crunched the data available for hepatitis B in China, India, Pakistan, Egypt and Bangladesh. Those countries with higher rates of hepatitis B in the 80's, she found, also tended to be the countries with the highest number of missing women. She decided that she had the fuel for what was bound to be a controversial paper.
  In December, Oster unveiled her research in The Journal of Political Economy. Working under the assumption that carriers of hepatitis B had 1.5 boys for every 1 girl, she concluded that ''hepatitis B can account for about 45 percent of the 'missing women': around 75 percent in China, between 20 and 50 percent in Egypt and western Asia, and under 20 percent in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal.''
  Her figures, intriguing as they are, still don't solve the entire mystery: even accounting for hepatitis B, 33 million female births did not occur. Clearly, there are other explanations for the missing women.
  Several economists have suggested that Oster's research illustrates how seemingly tedious number-crunching can significantly challenge cultural myths. Yet others fear that such findings are based on flimsy data and could help governments turn a blind eye to gender discrimination. Amartya Sen argues that when it comes to hepatitis B and the gender gap, Oster is ''saying that a connection exists, rather than testing it''; he suggests a more thorough statistical analysis that would take closer account of regional differences and variation over time as well as the notable fact that when families already have a child, their additional children are especially likely to be boys. Siri Tellier, the United Nations Population Fund representative in China, warns, ''We should not draw shaky conclusions, which could lead to ill-advised action.''
  It's true that Oster's research might lead some to play down the extent of Asia's gender troubles. Yet she stresses that her work applies only to the 1980's -- when the initial missing-women calculations were made and before the hepatitis B vaccine was widely distributed. You might expect that once it was distributed, the vaccine would have reversed the sex ratio imbalance -- as it did in Alaska. But in fact, the male-female imbalance in Asia has only become w"

Those taking part in the procession called for religious tolerance following rioting directed at Muslim targets in response to the grisly killing of 12 Nepalese hostages by Islamic insurgents in Iraq, said one organiser, Hemanta Sharma.
""The peace marchers included Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists,"" Sharma said.
Demonstrators carried placards with slogans reading ""Religious tolerance and national unity are Nepal's present need,"" witnesses said.
A group of people from various walks of life including artists, journalists, members of civil society and human rights activists separately held a peace meeting in the capital, lighting candles and praying for harmony.
The events were held after the Nepalese government further eased a curfew imposed last week to quell the rioting.
After initially announcing a 10-hour let-up in the curfew to allow people to buy food and get on with their normal business, the home ministry later extended it for another five hours until 10:00 pm. Authorities had relaxed the curfew for eight hours on Saturday.
""During the curfew period in the two cities, there were no reports of violence from any quarters,"" a police spokesman said.
The curfew has been in place in Kathmandu and Lalitpur on the southern outskirts of the capital since Wednesday to stop angry mobs that had attacked mosques and Muslim businesses after 12 Nepalese youths were killed by Islamic   militants who had held them hostage since August 19.
During the unrest police opened fire to disperse an angry crowd that tried to storm the Egyptian embassy, which represents Iraqi interests in the Himalayan kingdom.
At least two people were killed and more than 50 injured in the clashes between demonstrators and riot police.
However, there were no reports of violence overnight Saturday, police said.
People were seen walking to the markets to buy food and other essentials on Sunday, witnesses said.
Armed police and soldiers patrolled the streets of Kathmandu while security was heightened in sensitive areas of the capital.
Nepal's king, the prime minister and religious leaders also appealed for restraint.
Nepal, the world's only officially Hindu state where 86 percent of the population is Hindu, has experienced little of the inter-religious violence that has scarred neighbouring India. 
Muslims account for around four percent of the 27 million population.
A statement claiming responsibility for the killings of the Nepalese workers was posted on an Islamist website by an Al-Qaeda-linked group called the Army of Ansar al-Sunna.
It was accompanied by grisly pictures of the beheading of a blindfolded hostage and one where his bloodied head was held up like a trophy by a hooded captor. A video showed the other Nepalese being shot.

 Kathmandu: As the internal conflict has escalated in the country, all three wings of security forces - the Royal Nepalese Army, Armed Police Force and Nepal Police, have been modernizing as well as recruiting new manpower. Despite acknowledgement by the prime minister and other responsible officials that a growing defence budget was chipping away at investment in development and social services, the change in the shape and size of the security forces has continued unabated.
 Just over a month ago, the Royal Nepalese Army inducted 200 women soldiers and now it has opened up vacancies for women officers in non-technical posts. Although no exact number has been revealed, sources said around one hundred female officers will be recruited and several new positions will be opened up. Nepal Police, meanwhile, has started accepting applications for 600 new vacancies since Wednesday 22 September . In April, the government had passed a proposal by the Nepal police to open vacancies for 800 posts, including two assistant inspectors-general of police.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 22 Sep 04, p 1
Similarly, by recruiting 1,600 new members last year, the Armed Police Force is planning to increase its strength to 25,000 soon. A source said following the government approval of a proposal to form two new division headquarters and seven brigades, the Armed Police force is currently carrying out studies to recruit more manpower. The security forces have adopted a strategy to increase their strength by phases, as the Finance Ministry declined to provide required money in one instalment.
 The Royal Nepalese Army, since its deployment two years ago, had added nearly 28,000 soldiers to its strength. In late 2000, the strength of the Royal Nepalese Army stood at around 50,000.
 During the same period, Nepal Police has added 7,000 personnel. Armed Police Force, too, added another 7,000 personnel to its strength during the same period.
 In the fiscal year 1997/98 the defence budget was 5bn rupees. In 2000/2001 the defence budget rose to 13bn rupees.

Radio Nepal regularly refers to the Maoists as terrorists.
The federation also said reporter Som Sharma, who was abducted from the same area in May, is still in captivity and his conditions is unknown.

Since King Gyanendra sacked the government and took absolute power in February, the media has been restricted from freely reporting on the insurgency, the king, the government or the security forces.
Hundreds of journalists have been detained or arrested and about half dozen still remain in jail.

Zimbabwe missed a cluster of chances to pile the pressure on Pakistan, dropping five catches with a fielding fumble also costing them an easy run out.
The day was also marked by two batsmen passing the 1000 Test run landmark, with Mohammed Hafeez reaching 115 and scoring his third century and Umar Akmal, when he had reached 12.
However neither pair went very far afterwards.
Hafeez was out at lunch for 119, which included a six and 17 fours - a career highest.
Umar was out for 15 off the last ball of the day. He hit Greg Lamb hard onto a close fielder's shoulder and Brendan Taylor took the rebound.
Azhar Ali moved his overnight 27 to 75 before giving a nick to Tatendo Taibu off Lamb. It was his ninth Test 50 and his third in succession.
Captain Misbah ul Haq made a fluent 66, remarkably his ninth half century in his last 11 innings.
Predictably remaining to fight another day in partnership with the incoming Adnan Akmal is Younis Khan, who is on 61 after securing his 24th fifty.
Pakistan will be looking to these two to take them past the Zimbabwe total on Sunday.
There have been two significant partnerships for the tourists - Hafeez and Ali put on 188 for the second wicket and Khan put on 100 with Ul Haq for the fourth.
For Zimbabwe it was a generally successful day in difficult flat-pitch circumstances, due largely to the spinners Raymond Price and Lamb.
Price was economy supreme, conceding 39 runs in 34 overs with 18 maidens but without any wickets. Lamb disposed of three tourists for 85.
However the pacemen Chrisopher Mpofu and Brian Vitori drew blanks in conceding 148 runs between them.
Pakistan will need another good partnership Sunday to gain the advantage while Zimbabwe will need two more wickets to get into the tail and that could give them pole position.

The five women who have stood on its 8,611-meter (28,251 feet) peak before Pasaburn have all met their deaths at high altitude -- three of them while descending K2 and two of them on mountains in Nepal six years after their K2 feats.
Pasaban scaled the peak on Monday afternoon with three Spanish compatriots and four Italian climbers, including the grandson of one of the two Italians who first conquered the world's second highest summit on July 31, 1954.
Towering over the Karakoram ranges at an uninhabited border stretch between Pakistan and China, K2 is second only to Nepal's Everest, (8,848 meters/29,028 feet) in height, but mountaineers consider it more treacherous, and more striking for its isolation and almost perfect pyramid shape.
""K2 is a very difficult mountain. It is called the 'mountaineers' mountain' because of its difficulty and real challenge,"" veteran expedition organiser Naiknam Karim told AFP.
The ascent to its peak is riddled with slippery, sheer slopes of ice, including the feared ""bottleneck"", a 100-meter slope with a gradient of 80 to 90 degrees close to the summit.
""The 'bottleneck' is very steep and the danger of slipping is very high. It's here that the three women died,"" Karim said.
K2 is statistically deadlier than Everest.
It has a fatality rate of 27 percent, three times that of Everest. Until this week 198 people had scaled K2 since its conquest by Italian pair Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli. Fifty-three people died on its slopes.
Everest has claimed 179 lives against 2,000 summiteers, giving it a fatality rate of nine percent.
The first woman to scale its summit was Poland's Wanda Rutkiewicz, considered the greatest woman mountaineer. She stood on top of the mountain on June 23 1986, just hours ahead of Frenchwoman Liliane Barrard.
Liliane, 37, and her husband Maurice disappeared in a snowstorm on descent, and her body was found a month later at the foot of the mountain.
Rutkiewicz was lost in 1992 aged 49 while attempting to summit Nepal's Kangchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain.
Britain's Julie Tullis was the next woman on K2, reaching the summit a few weeks after Rutkiewicz and Barrard. But she was caught in a storm on descent and died, aged 47, from exhaustion and exposure.
In August 1992, Chantal Mauduit of France scaled K2. She came down successfully but died six years later aged 34 in an avalanche on Nepal's Dhaulagiri.
Britain's Alison Hargreaves, 33, stood on K2's summit in August 1995, but she too met her demise on descent.
""I knew Chantal Mauduit. She was a very strong woman. I never met Alison but I heard a lot about her, people used to say she was a very strong woman,"" said Karim, director of Adventure Tours Pakistan, one of the biggest K2 expedition organisers.
""Very few women attempt K2, less than 10 percent of the number of men who try to climb it.
""I don't think it's harder for women. In my personal opinion if one woman can climb, another can. Maybe women take less risks than men, in terms of mountaineering only.""
Three other women, Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, Nives Meroi and Eva Zarzuelo are also bidding for K2's peak this season.

"713",20031596,"Title: China refuses to say what it will do with 18 Tibetans deported from Nepal.rtf; Date: June 5, 2003 Thursday; Text: China refused Thursday to say what it will do with 18 Tibetans recently repatriated from Nepal, calling the decision an internal affair.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said the issue should not be ""politicized,"" calling it a simple case of ""illegal immigration"" because the Tibetans left China and entered Nepal illegally.
""Recently the Nepalese police seized 21 illegal immigrants from China. They left China illegally via Tibet. And according to the normal practice of handling illegal immigrants in the world, after verifying their identifities, 18 of them were repatriated to China on May 31,"" Zhang told a briefing.
""The Chinese side attaches great importance to, and has actively participated in international and regional cooperation in this field, so we maintain that the handling of illegal immigration should not be politicized or adopt a double standard on this question.""
The 18 Tibetans, eight aged under 16, entered Nepal in April hoping to reach the north Indian base of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.
They were arrested for entering the country without valid travel documents and held until they were handed over to Chinese embassy officials on Saturday, despite appeals by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Tibetan activists expressed fear that the Tibetans would be punished, perhaps in a labor camp, upon their return.
""As to how China will handle this case, it's a domestic issue and I'm not so clear about it,"" Zhang said Thursday, adding she had no details about the backgrounds of the 18 Tibetans or whether they had committed any political crimes.
Officials in Tibet refused comment on the case Thursday, calling it a ""state secret.""
""This is all state secrets. Even if there was such an incident, state security would handle it, we wouldn't know,"" said an official at the communist party's office in Shigatse city, near Lhasa.
State security officials in Tibet also refused to comment.
Both the United States and Britain have condemned the deportation as a violation of international norms and practices dictating the humane treatment of asylum seekers.
But a statement from the Chinese embassy in Nepal said the matter was ""within Nepal's sovereign jurisdiction and common international practice.""
As many as 35,000 Tibetan refugees have settled in Nepal, but the kingdom is careful not to anger Beijing and has refused to let the Dalai Lama visit.
The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize three decades later for his non-violent opposition to Beijing's presence in Tibet.

The Chairman also asked the government to give a statement on her murder. The entire opposition joining hand to assail the government for its failure to arrest the killers of Mehar, demanded CBI probe into the case.
  While rejecting the adjournment motion moved by the Congress members Nasib Pathan and Ranjit Singh Judeo, the Chairman said the matter was serious and a statement should come from the State. The leader of the House and Minister for Family Welfare Ahmad Hasan rejecting the demand for CBI probe, said that the police had been investigating all aspects and divulging further details at this moment would only affect the probe.
  The minister said police had been probing reason for criminals' stay in Dilip Tower where Mehar was shot at on February 28. The minister asking the members not to politicise the case said the government had taken action against the police personnel for their apathy towards the case. Saluting Mehar for her courage to take on the criminals in the city the minister said all efforts were being made to arrest the main accused Amit Singh and Sachin Pahadi.
  While Nasib Pathan and Rajit Singh Judeo (Congress) expressed concern over deteriorating law and order situation, the Opposition leader Dr Nepal Singh said women were not safe under the present dispensation in the state. Sheema Rizvi (BJP) said there was glaring police apathy towards this case. She said when Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had been feeling threat to his life, the plight of the common people could understand. KK Gautam (BSP) also supported the demand for CBI probe. However, Ahmad Hasan said the government was concerned about the issue and stern action would be taken against the culprits.

 Chitwan, 1 May: Conservation officers of the Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) have revealed that two American nationals killed a ""man-eater"" tigress in the buffer zone of the park while carrying out an unauthorized darting last month. The incident was kept secret till now by park officials, fearing public outcry by the people inhabiting in the buffer zone of the park.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 2 May 04[passage omitted$
 The officials have concluded that they were fake tiger experts since they did not possess even a thermometer during the darting. They were staying in Tiger Tops Jungle Resort nearby.
 The cause of death was kept secret at the beginning. The park officials had told the public inhabiting in the buffer zone of the park that ""the tigress was a man-eater and was killed while trying to dart it"" since the park officials did not know about the darting by the Americans. The tigress died the day after the darting.
 Meanwhile, a cub was shot dead by a local at the maize field of Sinsubar of Divyanagar VDC [village development committee area$ . According to Kunwar, the dead was the one of the three cubs of the killed tigress. The remaining two are roaming here and there suffering from hunger as they cannot prey even a kid. [sentence as published$
 Twenty people had lost their lives to the so-called man-eater tigers within last four months in this area. Three tigers that were believed to be man-eaters were killed in Divyanagar, Madi and Kumroj last month.

"4780",20063089,"Title: Nepal Maoists call for drastic land, army and social reform.rtf; Date: May 29, 2006 Monday 3:28 PM GMT; Text: Drastic land reforms, army restructuring and more social inclusion for women and ethnic minorities are needed in Nepal, a senior Maoist said Monday.
Nepal's King Gyanendra ended 14 months of direct rule in late April after weeks of pro-democracy protests by sidelined political parties in concert with the rebel Maoists.
""After the historic people's movement, the country has an immediate and important task of institutionalizing a democratic republic,"" said Baburam Bhattarai, the rebel's second in command.
""To achieve this goal, restructuring of the army, revolutionary land reforms and special privileges for women and marginalized groups among others are necessary,"" he said in a statement.
Since the king handed back power to the coalition of parties, the new government has clipped the king's powers, matched a rebel ceasefire and met a key Maoist demand for elections to a body to redraft Nepal's constitution.
""Free and fair elections to a constituent assembly should be held as soon as possible,"" said Bhattarai in the statement.
The rebels are calling for Nepal to become a republic, but two of the country's three biggest political parties have said that the king could be given a ceremonial role.
The Maoist leader said the new parliament and the government should be scrapped and the 1990 constitution abandoned.
""We have stressed the dissolution of parliament, the constitution and the government and the establishment of a new interim people's representative organization, interim constitution and interim government reflecting the new reality of the country,"" he said. 
The new government and the Maoists have agreed on a code of conduct for the ceasefire, and the government has released hundreds of rebel prisoners.
Gyanendra sacked the government and took direct control of the impoverished nation in February 2005. 
He said the takeover was needed because the political parties were corrupt and had failed to tackle the bloody Maoist insurgency that has killed at least 12,500 people since 1996. 
Once former foes, the ousted political parties and the rebels formed a loose alliance late last year.
The mass protests that crippled Nepal for weeks in April were organized by the political parties and the rebels, and preliminary peace talks have already begun.

"7730",20117420,"Title: Uncertain global climate negotiation.rtf; Date: November 1, 2011 Tuesday; Text: Nepal, Nov. 1 -- Climate change has drawn global attention. Enunciation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC, 1992) is testimony to this, which is desperately trying to save the world from impending climate catastrophe through deliberations at annual Convention of Parties (COP) meetings. This is conceived both through mitigation (direct reduction of green house gases (GHG) and including their offsets) and adaptation (i.e. supporting toward adapting to the effects of climate change). The first round of initiatives started through Kyoto Protocol (KP) in 1997 where the majority of developed countries (annex I party) agreed to reduce overall GHG by 5.2 percent over 1990 level.
Realizing the inadequacy of the protocol, the world in 2007 conceived to fill the shortfall through Bali Action Plan (BAP). BAP followed a two-track approach to address the issue: The first concentrated on more ambitious targets from annex I party; and the second focused on what has been called Long-Term Cooperative Action (LCA). The purpose of LCA remained more encompassing in that it aspired to bring all countries of the world on board irrespective of whether developed or developing or the signatory of KP or its abstainer.
UNRESOLVED DEBATES
The world was supposed to seal a deal over both tracks in Copenhagen (COP15) in 2009. However, debacle persisted even in COP 16 held one year later in Cancun. The desperate world is now aiming for an agreement at COP 17 scheduled in Durban, in December 2011. The world has met many times in between both formally and informally so as to do homework on the matter, the last being in Panama between October 1-7 this year. It may, however, be noted that controversies persisted on a number of issues including mitigation and adaptation themes and the subsidiary agendas complementing those such as 'technology transfer' and 'finance'.
BONE OF CONTENTION
While many countries have ceded for a 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperature (compared to the preindustrial era), some countries such as the Small Island States are still reluctant to give up their position. They posit that the world cannot afford to cross the limit of 1.5 degrees: A possible safe limit indicated by science. In any case, countries such as the US and emerging economies such as China and India are 'locking their horns'. While the former group insists on virtual uniformity in future emissions, the later emphasize that the developed world should essentially take the major burden on emission reduction owing to their 'historical responsibility'.
Controversies are rife also in 'financing'. Though an agreement was reached in Cancun for establishing Green Climate Fund under the direct control of UNFCCC, there is skepticism among the developing world that the developed counterparts would really allow to make it functionally happen. The current environment of international debt crisis is feared to create further adversities. Thus, allocation of a sum of 100 billion to finance climate change initiatives in developing countries by 2020, a sum promised during Cancun, is seen as an 'empty promise' on the part of developed world.
The desperate world is aiming for an agreement at COP 17 scheduled in Durban, in December 2011. It may, however, be noted that controversies persist on a number of issues including mitigation and adaptation themes and the subsidiary agendas complementing those such as 'technology transfer' and 'finance'.
Large-scale controversy also lies on dividing this indicative sum into mitigation and adaptation. While the developing world would insist on secured funding through government financing, the developed counterparts would like put the burden on the market/ private sector. The US is once again shirking away from the Kyoto Protocol by saying that 'condition is not ripe' for it. Complexities are exacerbated by the fact that Japan, Canada and Russia, the signatory of the KP, have now decided to pull out. Developing countries, which thus far had a united voice, have now split. While the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) wants a comprehensive agreement under the convention, India and China, in particular, are not supportive of the idea for fear that this might force them as well to contribute toward emission reduction. These are some of the complicated issues, which lend to an inference that chances of sealing a deal in Durban are rather slim.
NEPAL'S GROUND REALITY
The country has drawn its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) with due realization that its role in climate adaptation is much more urgent and meaningful compared to mitigation. However, confusion abounds in terms of implementing the same. While NAPA enshrines decentralized philosophy as a modus operandi for intervention, several factors tend to impede the process.
Six sectoral ministries are assigned individually to lead the nine 'Combined Profiles' each of which seriously lack knowledge regarding intervention. Th"

The blockade, to protest the disappearance of activists in army detention, has halted traffic on Kathmandu's main north and west arteries for all vehicles, including those carrying tourists northeast to the Tibetan border and west to scenic Pokhara.
Two soldiers were killed and two injured while clearing mines planted to block a highway at Dandakhola west of the capital, an army source said.
Kathmandu residents facing their second rebel blockade in five months have begun hoarding essentials, which has led to a scarcity of food and petroleum products, a consumer group said.
""The prices of vegetables, sugar and other edible goods has almost doubled since the blockade began,"" said resident Ram Devi Sharma.
On Thursday the rebels burned 18 trucks, causing transport firms to halt operations on the blockaded roads for fear of further attacks. The insurgents have also felled trees and planted mines and other obstacles to close the roads.
""There is enough stock of petroleum products for three months but people are on a buying spree, fearing acute shortages in the near future,"" said home ministry spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey.
A third highway, the Mahendra which heads east from the capital and links the country to India, is partially blocked in the southeast of the country, transport owners said, adding that most traffic to and from Kathmandu had been brought to a halt.
The move by the rebels -- who are fighting to topple the monarchy and create a communist republic -- comes as King Gyanendra cancelled a scheduled 11-day visit to India Thursday, citing the death of former Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
On Thursday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for an immediate end to the deadly fighting in Nepal and expressed concern at reports of human rights abuses.
Twenty-two rebels were reported killed Thursday in clashes with security forces in the poor mountain nation, where Maoist fighters have been battling since 1996.
At least 120 Maoists, 46 soldiers and four policemen have been killed in separate clashes since December 12, according to police and army figures. The conflict has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996.
The government has set a January 13 deadline for the Maoists to open peace negotiations. The king has said new elections will be held if they continue to resist talks.
Police said the main highways into the capital were deserted Friday morning.
Home ministry officials said there was adequate security along the highways but transport companies say they have halted operations.
In August the Maoists staged a week-long blockade of the capital, spreading fear among its 1.5 million inhabitants and sending produce prices soaring.

   The Congress must not only fight off the Bharatiya Janata Party which has just scored a satisfying victory in Karnataka by breaking the JD (U) and taking the largest part away. At the same time the Left wants to score against the Congress in the two primary states of West Bengal and Kerala. Will it try to displace the Congress in Assam? Can the Congress forestall the implications?
   Not that the Congress has been left behind. It has managed some credit for itself though it is constantly under attack. It has pushed back the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra while its ally Sharad Pawar is trying to increase his own strength but not yet knowing how far he can go in branching out on his own. The Congress should look with satisfaction at the role Uma Bharati is playing in Madhya Pradesh and other BJP strongholds. The BJP's new president, Rajnath Singh, has tried to play quite a role of ascendancy, even leaving the primacy in the home state of up to a group led by two Ks, Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katyar, but political watchers are also watching the upmanship of the Leader of the Opposition, LK Advani, is displaying. Advani's eyes are on the next general election when he hopes that he can grasp the prime ministerial post. He has said it openly but it does not seem to satisfy the other ambitious though second rank- leaders in the party. Yet this is of much importance to the Congress and the Left who are fearful of the BJP's new stance to push forward Hinduvata following the bomb blasts in Varanasi. The Government made haste to say that it will explain the implications of its policy to Muslim leaders. But why give it a communal twinge? Why not say that it will explain the policy to all those who opposed the nuclear deal and the attitude towards Iran?
   Before the general elections the big fight will also be on in Uttar Pradesh where ironically neither the Congress nor the BJP have much to look forward to even though they are going to make a bid for superiority. The main fight is going to be between Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's BSP. Who will score is yet to be seen. Faint reports from Lucknow seem to suggest that the Congress and the SP may not go for the ultimate weapon against each other. Is this so? The reports lack confirmation.
   The other state going to the polls is Tamil Nadu. Here the political situation has cleared up. The division of seats has defined the alignments. Vaiko's MDMK has joined hands with the AIADMK, baffling the observers who thought that after having put him in jail Jayalalitha would not come to terms with Vaiko. The Congress remains with the DMK.
   Everywhere the Congress has to make a bid to increase its strength, not so much for its strength in the states but to keep its superiority in numbers alive at the Centre. If it fails in this, things will not be happy for it.
  Strangely but not surprisingly for a rare time since Jawaharlal Nehru, foreign and strategic affairs have got mixed up with domestic politics to the extent that this is affecting the performance of parties wanting to play a decisive role before the general elections. The Congress scored a resounding show in the Bush visit but the Left drew away from the UPA and the BJP supported for its own reasons the direction of the nuclear policy. What a turn of attitudes!
   Its difficulty is that the Congress must not show itself all the time as an unquestioning ally of the United States. It will demand great diplomatic skill of the UPA to turn away from many of the fronts the United States is going to open up after what it did in Iraq. If France and Germany could keep away from President Bush's undertaking in Iraq, why cannot India have a policy of its own? The Congress must not become a camp-follower. It must show dexterity and power. It must continue its independent foreign policy which was its guideline from the days of Jawaharlal Nehru.
   The Congress history made India a power left of Centre in domestic affairs as well as internationally"

A panel led by senior leader Sher Bahadur Deuba today presented the five-page document, which dealt with NC's bottom-line for completing the peace process, at the party's Central Working Committee meeting at the party headquarters in Sanepa. Following the discussion on the document, the party will approve it making it the party's authentic version tomorrow, according to party sources.
The document, however, does not mention the time limit to complete the peace process. Without specifying the number, it has suggested to fix the number of combatants as per the past agreement made at the leadership level. However, the combatants will have to fulfil the basic requirements of the concerned security bodies for integration and they will remain under the command and control of the bodies. All UNMIN verified weapons will be brought under government control.
It adds that those who want voluntary retirement should be allowed to leave the camps and for those who want to be rehabilitated package should be prepared to provide them with seed money.
The government will provide security to the camps to be integrated and to rehabilitated combatants, states the document.
NC has been claiming that late NC leader Girija Prasad Koirala and Unified CPN-Maoist chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had made a verbal agreement to integrate 3,000-5,000 combatants in different security bodies, before signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006. The UCPN-M, however, says that although the number was discussed, it was not agreed upon.
The plan seeks to ensure justice for the conflict victims by declaring the people killed by Maoists as martyrs and providing relief and compensation to their families and the families of those who sustained disability during the conflict, providing their children free education, giving priority to their children for employment and arranging treatment for injured people.
It adds that all property seized during the conflict should be returned to the rightful owners and all interest and principal up to Rs 1 million of bank loan be waived of for victims.
The displaced people should be rehabilitated by providing them relief and keeping
their proper record, adds
the document.
Meanwhile, another panel led by Parliamentary Party leader Ram Chandra Paudel is holding consultation with experts about the issues of state restructuring. Paudel told today's CWC meeting that he would submit his report in a week.
Action plan
Ensure justice for conflict victims
Pass a Bill to form a commission on disappeared people
Pass a Bill to form a Commission on Truth and Reconciliation Commission - probe the violent incidents during the conflict and make arrangements for reconciliation of conflicting parties
Activate all-party peace committees at central (Peace and Reconstruction Ministry) and local levels
Manage combatants
Put an end to dual security for Maoist leaders - from government and combatants - and scrap paramilitary forces of the party. In addition, the government should impound all illegal vehicles used by Maoists and take legal action

More than 500 people staged a sit-in protest on the outskirts of the capital against Gyanendra, who dismissed the elected government early this year, claiming he needed full executive powers to put down a Maoist rebellion.
The 12-hour protest was staged by human rights groups, political activists and journalists on a highway near Kathmandu's airport, witnesses said.
Jail authorities, meanwhile, freed newly-pardoned prisoners across the country, according to Nepal's state-owned news agency RSS.
The constitution came into being in 1990 with the re-establishment of multi-party democracy after 30 years of the party-less Panchayat system, which collapsed following political protests.
The king dismissed the government in February, earning him international condemnation and a suspension of arms sales from India and Britain.
The rebellion that aims to topple the monarch and create a Maoist state has seen some 12,000 people killed since 1996.
In a message to the nation marking Constitution Day, Gyanendra said the right atmosphere had been created for elections to be held soon.
""It is a matter of satisfaction for all those who have faith in democracy that ... a conducive environment has been created in the last eight months to initiate the process of free and fair elections, ensuring a meaningful exercise in democracy,"" RSS quoted him as saying.
Nepal is gearing up for municipal elections on February 8. Last month the king also directed the Election Commission to hold general elections by mid-April 2007.
Major opposition parties have demanded the restoration of democracy and threatened to boycott any elections held by an ""unconstitutional"" government.
The president of the Nepali Congress party, Girija Prasad Koirala, on Wednesday said ""there has been continuous attack on the constitution, sliding the country into further crisis and chaos"".
""History has given us an additional responsibility to safeguard the spirit of the constitution and take the country to new heights, where people's rights are not encroached against,"" said Koirala.
Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist acting general secretary Bamdev Gautam said the king's power grab had ""destroyed the sovereignty of people"".
The Nepali Congress-Democratic party's acting president, Gopal Man Shrestha, charged that the king had ""abused (his) power to strengthen and sustain his autocratic regime by misusing the constitution"".

  The Maoists were killed during a search operation conducted by the police in the morning. 
  Four Maoists belonging to Praja Pratighatna Group of Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist (CPI-ML) were on April 21 gunned down by police in a gun battle in Andhra Pradesh's Warangal district.
  The Maoist violence in the state has claimed more than 6,000 lives since the early 1970s.
  The Maoists have in 2006 blown up police vehicles and railway tracks, attack civilian self defence groups and even hijacked a train with over hundreds of villagers. 
  The insurgency, named after the town of Naxalbari where it emerged in 1967, is thought to affect 165 of the country's 602 administrative districts in a ""red corridor"" stretching from the southern tip of India all along its eastern half and up to Nepal. 
  The worst-affected states like Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkand and Bihar have agreed to speed up development and land reforms in the impoverished rural hinterland where the Maoists thrive. New Delhi also offered them an additional 56 million dollars to beef up security over the next five years.

 Kathmandu, 12 November: Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari expressed his objections to Prime Minister Sher Bhadur Deuba regarding the remarks of government spokesman Mohammad Mohasin on Friday 12 November .
 According to a top-level source, Adhikari met with the prime minister at his official residence at Baluwatar and demanded that Mohasin be asked to furnish clarification regarding his remarks. ""It is not good to make such remarks publicly,"" the source said, quoting Adhikari.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 13 Nov 04
It is learnt that the prime minister assured him by saying that he would find out the facts. The deputy prime minister gave objections to the prime minister after the ministers from the Communist Party of Nepal-UML Unified Marxist Leninist decided for the move.
 The CPN-UML, a key partner in the present government, has strongly protested against remarks of government spokesman Mohammad Mohasin that authoritarian rule will be inevitable if the present government failed.
 ""I have pity towards the people who envisage authoritarianism,"" Deputy Prime Minister Adhikari, who leads the UML ministers in the government, told Kantipur on Friday 12 November . ""If what he said was correctly reported in the media, the UML has strong objections to that.""
 The alternative of authoritarianism is out of question even if the present government fails, said Adhikari. If that authoritarian situation comes, the UML will launch a struggle, he warned.  passage omitted
 Mohasin had expressed the view that if the multiparty government failed to solve the problem, it would mean the failure of the liberal political system. ""If we cannot tackle it through the liberal regime, we will have to go for the authoritarian rule,"" he had said.
 Adhikari declined to react to what exactly Mohasin had remarked and what the media reported and said, ""We cannot even imagine this government going for authoritarianism as an alternative to peace.""
 Adhikari said that the cabinet had not even discussed the remarks of Information and Communications Minister Mohasin, let alone endorsing it. The basis of the formation of the present government is the 43-point agreement on common minimum programmes. Therefore, the government is functioning under the guidelines of the agreement, he said. The main assignments of the government are to conducting elections after holding peace negotiations with the Maoists, protecting and consolidating democracy, and providing relief to the people. So the government is committed to them. It is for this reason that the government has been repeatedly asking the Maoists for talks, he said.
 ""This government wants to strengthen democracy. In no circumstance can it be pro-authoritarian. In fact, this government was constituted to prevent such things,"" he said.
 Adhikari urged that the government should place stress on peace talks. Possibilities for peace have not been exhausted, he said. ""Peace talks and elections are the objectives of the government.""
 It is for peace talks that the government has constituted the Peace Secretariat and the Peace Committee, he said and revealed that informal and indirect contacts were being established with the Maoists. ""I would not like to focus on who said what. The nation needs peace. My vision is for restoration of peace,"" he said.
 Adhikari warned that unless peace is restored in the country before it is too late, the proportion of violence and killings is set to spiral beyond imagination. ""If authoritarian situation does come, the UML will join hands with other democratic forces and launch struggle,"" he said.

The operation began Thursday in Rukum district, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, and in a half dozen other districts known as Maoist rebel strongholds, army spokesman Rajendra Thapa said.
""The operation is to break the so-called base area of the rebels,"" he said.
He refused to say how many soldiers were involved. But officials speaking on condition of anonymity from operation headquarters in the southwestern border city of Nepalgunj said hundreds of troops have been deployed.
The operation will provide rebel fighters with an opportunity to surrender to the authorities, Thapa said. The government says more than 900 rebels have surrendered since it announced an amnesty in December last year.
No major clashes between the troops and the rebels were reported.
The operation follows information that guerrillas had gathered in the area - which is largely rebel-controlled - to launch a major attack. Thapa did not provide details, although rebels sometimes stage attacks on government offices, military bases and police stations in district capitals.
The rebels, who have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state, say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.
Fighting has escalated since the rebels withdrew from a cease-fire in August.

But the monarch, vaulted to the throne three years ago when most of the royal family was massacred by a drunken crown prince, set no time frame for the re-establishment of democratic rule in the kingdom racked by a Maoist revolt.
""The future of Nepal lies in constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy,"" the king told Time magazine, adding he believed the landlocked nation's difficulties should be solved through dialogue.
The interview came amid resurgent Maoist violence in the tiny kingdom sandwiched between India and China and growing demonstrations by students and political parties calling for restoration of democratic rule.
Protests have been underway for months against Gyanendra's decision to dismiss the elected government because of what he said was its incompetence in tackling Nepal's vast array of problems including the revolt by Maoists battling to overthrow the monarchy and install a communist republic.
Gyanendra defended his decision to dismiss the government.
""Had I not acted as I did, I think Nepal would be in a worse situation than it is today,"" he said.
The king, regarded in Nepal as the incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, the protector, said he believed the only way out of the political deadlock was through ""a consensus government.""
Gyanendra said he was grateful for help from the United States, Britain and India in helping tackle the Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 9,000 lives since 1996.
But he said more aid was needed as the country was battling the insurgents ""in shoestring circumstances.""
Gyandendra also spoke about the massacre in which his brother, King Birendra, and other royal relatives were killed when Crown Prince Dipendra went on a drunk-and-drug fuelled shooting rampage at the royal palace in 2001.
Dipendra later shot himself.
Gyanendra said he had suffered a ""tragic personal loss.""

Oh my child, why have you left us?"" She shrieks through her sobs at the foot of her dead son's bed, but no one pays much attention.
Death has become a common sight here.
Four days earlier, Malti's 16-year-old son, Lakshman, fell ill with a high fever. His condition worsened until the family drove him 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the government hospital in Gorakhpur, near the border with Nepal.
Lakshman joined hundreds of other children struggling to survive the same disease, many lying two to a bed. Over the past six months, Japanese encephalitis has ravaged both sides of the border, killing more than 1,000 people, mostly poor Indian children.
The mosquito-borne virus is easily prevented with vaccines, but there is no money for the shots in this poverty-stricken corner of northern India.
Most parents wait until the situation becomes dire before scrounging enough rupees to travel to the government-run B.R.D. Medical College in Gorakhpur, hoping for a miracle.
But miracles are hard to produce without supplies, equipment and staff - all in short supply at the overcrowded and long-neglected hospital, where dirty water pools at the bottom of a stairwell and floors are covered with grime, medical wrappers and an occasional syringe.
The humid air is thick with the smell of death.
Dr. K.P. Kushwaha remains committed. He races from patient to patient, checking oxygen being pumped into heaving chests and placing a comforting hand on the shuddering shoulders of mothers like Malti.
As the pediatrician in charge of the Japanese encephalitis wards, he has seen many outbreaks over the past 25 years. In 1986, 960 patients were hospitalized with the disease. But nothing compares to this year: About 560 of the more than 2,000 patients admitted have died.
""This is the worst,"" Kushwaha says, shaking his head. ""This is the severest epidemic we have ever seen.""
Uttar Pradesh is ripe for the disease because it has plenty of rice paddies and a bowl-shaped landscape that allows water to collect in pools. Heavy rains have saturated the ground this year, leaving the perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes that carry the disease from pigs to humans.
Residents are often illiterate, making it harder to raise awareness about the disease, Kushwaha says.
Given the state government's lack of money and political will to vaccinate 7 million children in the affected areas, Kushwaha said the easiest solution would be to eliminate all swine. Although many Indians are strict vegetarians, the Hindu religion does not restrict eating pork.
""People are dying because of pigs,"" he said. ""It's really very frustrating to us.""
Medical experts have argued that India should acquire a cheap, one-shot vaccine for the disease produced in China. India produces a more expensive kind that requires three shots.
Regardless, it's too late to prevent this year's outbreak.
Japanese encephalitis patients take up two floors at the Gorakhpur hospital. Children dominate the caseload because most adults in the area have immunity to the virus. Only about 1 in 250 people infected develop symptoms, and survivors become immune.
The unlucky who fall ill face raging fevers up to 40 degrees C (104 degrees F), followed by convulsions and coma. The World Health Organization estimates 75 percent of survivors live with some type of physical, mental or emotional disability.
Japanese encephalitis strikes only in Asia, where the WHO says an average of 50,000 cases are reported per year, with 15,000 deaths. Many cases go unreported.
But the illness is pushed down on the priority list by other diseases, including AIDS and malaria, that compete for money and attention.
""Frankly speaking, it is not very high because those cases are relatively small,"" WHO Director General Dr. Lee Jong-wook said on the sidelines of a WHO meeting in New Caledonia.
At the Gorakhpur hospital, relatives sleep in shifts for weeks in crowded hallways, and in one ward, 80 patients are stacked in 54 beds.
In a small intensive care unit, unconscious children sleep with hoses taped to their faces and their eyes rolled back. There are only seven ventilators for the most severe cases, but not enough doctors to ensure they're working properly.
Parents act as nurses in a vast open-air area with rows of beds. They hold plastic tubing from oxygen cylinders and pound their chidren's chests to try to help them breathe. They bathe their children to ease burning fevers. Mostly, they sit and hope.
Occasionally, a wail is heard and a mother falls to her knees as death visits another bed that soon will be filled by a new sick child.

""We have reports that more than 600 pro-democracy activists have been arrested by the police, and they are continuing raids,"" said Krishna Sitaula of Nepali Congress, the country's largest party. Sitaula said he and many other dissidents were in hiding, and that his house was raided several times.
The king seized absolute power on Feb. 1, 2005, saying it was necessary to quell the country's growing communist rebellion and clean up government corruption but drawing criticism from foreign leaders who called it a setback for democracy.
The rebels, who started their violent campaign for a socialist state a decade ago and have intensified attacks in recent weeks, launched a raid overnight on a western Nepal town, officials said.
An alliance of seven major political parties that oppose the king's direct rule hoped to launch a major protest rally in Katmandu's main square on Wednesday. Similar rallies also were planned in other major towns in Nepal. Security forces throughout the country were on high alert.
""We will mark the black day with protest rallies and by burning effigies of the royal government,"" Nepali Congress spokesman Shovakar Parajuli said.
The rebel assault was on the town of Tansen, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Katmandu.
Fighting continued there Wednesday morning following overnight rebel attacks on an army camp, police station, town jail and government buildings in the town, said Gangadutta Awasti, a government administrator in neighboring Rupandehi district.
Security officials reached by telephone feared there would be casualties.
The king was scheduled on Wednesday to address the impoverished Himalayan nation, according to state-run Nepal Television and Radio Nepal, although the content of his speech was unclear.
The United States renewed its calls for the monarch to discuss a return to democracy with the country's main political parties.
""After one year of unsuccessful authoritarian rule, this is the best way to address the Maoist insurgency and to build a brighter future for Nepal's people,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said overnight in Washington.
Palace rule has ""only made the security situation more precarious, emboldened the Maoist insurgents and widened the division between the country's political parties,"" he said.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists said human rights activists and lawyers will join its members at a rally in Katmandu to condemn restrictions on the media imposed since the king took over.
Several newspapers have been forced to shut and a crackdown on journalists saw scores jailed in the past year, according to the federation. About a half dozen journalists are still in jail, it said.
A pro-monarchist group said it planned to demonstrate in support of the king. The Rastriya Bajrang Party, a little-known group, said it would hold a motorcycle rally in the capital to celebrate the king's takeover of power last year.
The country's Maoists rebels began fighting in 1996 to replace the monarchy with a socialist government. The civil war has killed about 12,000 people.
The guerrillas have intensified assaults on government troops since ending a unilateral cease-fire on Jan. 2, accusing the government of failing to match the pledge.

The former rebels were originally allotted 73 seats but 10 more were added during the weekend, giving them 83 members in the 330-seat interim Parliament to be formed Monday. That would make the ex-rebels the second largest group in the legislature.
It would be the rebels' first foray into the political mainstream since entering peace talks and signing a peace accord with the government last year aimed at ending a conflict that claimed 13,000 lives.
On Monday, members of parliament discussed the interim constitution prepared by the government and rebel negotiators. Parliament was to be dissolved later Monday to make way for the new interim legislature that includes the former rebels.

 Minister for Information and Communications Kamal Thapa has made it clear that the concept of joint security force is a system adopted to achieving efforts towards unity in the operation of all the security bodies for securing common security objectives. Minister Thapa, in a press release today 7 November , stated that the essence of the concept on joint security force is to enhance the capability of the security force through the use and mobilization of the resources and manpower of all the security agencies in a unified manner. The Royal Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and National Investigation Department would be jointly mobilized in a planned and coordinated manner under the joint security force for curbing the Maoist violence, killings and terrorism and achieving the common security objective of disarming them, it is stated.
 It is self-evident that development of common thinking in all the security bodies in the effective action against terrorist activities of the Maoists by means of appropriate use of available means and resources and exchange of training, motivation and experience among the security personnel would consolidate their strength in a qualitative manner and success would be achieved in the task of restoring peace and order in the country, the minister for information and communications has stated in a press release.
The Rising Nepal, Kathmandu, in English 8 Nov 03
He has further stated that all the policy decisions regarding the Civil Military National Campaign approved by His Majesty's Government and the joint security force, which is mobilized as per the security policy, and action plan would be under political and civilian leadership. Stating that joint security force would be mobilized as per the constitution and the existing laws, Minister Thapa made it clear that this arrangement would remain in force for a year for the time being and it would be revived every six months. The concept of joint military security force is not new and this system is fully compatible with law in the context of the then Council of Ministers on 11 March 2002 decided to involve Nepal police also in the security actions under the unified command of the Royal Nepal Army, he has stated in the press release.
 A provision has been made in Article 8 of the Armed Police Force Act-2002 that the armed force would remain under the control of Royal Nepal Army throughout the period of the Royal Nepal Army is mobilized for the purpose of maintaining peace and order in any part of the Kingdom of Nepal, Minister Thapa said.  He stressed that in this manner the present government has only implemented the decision taken some 20 months back and the provisions made in the laws in a strong, more effective and planned way.  The legal status and role of all the security agencies to be mobilized under joint security force for achieving the common security objectives would remain as it is, the administrative work of all the security bodies would remain functional as it exists at present and the role of all these security bodies would be clearly defined and specified even when they remain mobilized under the joint security force, Minister Thapa said, adding there is no need for confusion since the leadership of the joint security force when it is in security operation is obviously done by the Royal Nepal Army. Positive and encouraging results have been achieved within a short span of time after His Majesty's government implemented the concept of joint security force in a planned and novel manner, he said, noting that it is clearly seen that the Maoists have suffered great losses as a result of this security arrangement. He stated that appropriate system for coordination has been put in place at central, regional and district levels in order to maintain uniformity and coordination in the mobilization of the joint security force. Provisions have been made in which the Council of Ministers would be the body having authority for maintaining peace and security at the central level and the regional administrator and the district administrators would be the agencies having this authority at the regional and district levels respectively, he noted. It is certainly not in the interest of the country and the people to make such baseless and imaginary statements to the effect that militarization has become predominant in the country and the joint security force concept, is illegal to the utter neglect of the joint security force concept, Minister Thapa said in the press release, adding it does not suit the responsible persons themselves to make such flippant comments on the present situation when all sides should extend cooperation in the security steps taken by the government when the law and order situation in the country is in disarray due to the terrorist activiti"

But 13 Chinese, South Korean and American mountaineers on the northern side reached the summit of the world's highest mountain - including a man from Spokane, Wash. and his 20-year-old son, believed to be the youngest American to succeed.
A record number of people are trying to scale the Himalayan peak this month to honor the historic climb of Sir Edmund Hillary, of New Zealand, and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepalese guide.
Veteran mountaineers are gathering in the Nepalese capital next week for the event, including Hillary and Junko Tabei, who in 1975 became the first woman to reach the summit. Tenzing Norgay died in 1986.
With only a few days left in the climbing season, the thwarted mountaineers on the Nepalese side had hoped to reach the 29,035-foot-high summit after several days of better weather. Increasingly strong winds and rain forced them to return to the highest camp, at 26,240 feet.
The weather has been mostly unfavorable on Everest this year. Climbers have lost tents, equipment and supplies in wind storms, which have forced many to retreat to base camp at 17,400 feet.
The Nepalese government has issued climbing permits to 22 expedition teams for the March to May season, each with about 12 members plus Sherpas who help carry gear up the icy slopes.
Meeting with Indian mountaineers in New Delhi, Hillary, 83, described how he wriggled to the top of a 12-meter rock wall and stepped onto the snow-blanketed ridge on May 29, 1953: ""I realized we were on top of Mount Everest and the whole world was spread out below us.""
More than 1,200 climbers have reached the summit since then, and at least 175 have died trying.
Climbers on the northern side of the mountain in Tibet fought snow and high winds during the final stretch to the top.
John Roskelley, 54, and his son Jess, of Spokane, reported their success in a satellite telephone call home. ""Being able to do it together was a dream for both of them,"" said Dan McConnell, a spokesman for the Roskelley's trip who received the call.
Nepalese mountaineering officials said they knew of no American younger than 20 reaching the summit, but that they did not keep official records.
Eight Chinese and three South Korean climbers also reached the summit, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Niraula, 55, was shot at point blank range near Pidari Maisthan area at around 1030 a.m. [0445 gmt] when he was on his way to the office, reports quoting eyewitnesses said. He was shot in the chest and died while being treated at Janakpur Zonal Hospital.

"7791",20117047,"Title: Party cadres or civil society leaders_.rtf; Date: August 4, 2011 Thursday; Text: Nepal, Aug. 4 -- Covering a function that was arranged and live televised by a TV channel close to Chairman of UCPN (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, this daily reported on July 24: Civil society leaders (four persons were named), among others, had advised Dahal not to share his power with other leaders saying such a move would weaken him in the party. They also criticized Mohan Baidya and Baburam Bhattarai for forging an alliance to make the party chairman weak.
Although Dahal too criticized his intra-party rivals on the occasion, compared to his reproach, condemnations of the so-called civil society leaders were far more callous. One of them, a columnist, better known for insulting remarks about his political opponents than for critical analysis, equated Dahal's adversaries with sewage. Referring to their factional meetings that took place around Dhobighat area, he compared them with Kathmandu's sewerage which passes through the location; hence he opined that they should 'be flushed out of the capital'.
Another, a pro-Maoist journalist, often branded as a 'political analyst', came heavily on Dahal's intra-party rivals. The third, a medical doctor used by Maoists as their showpiece because of his professional reputation vented his anger at Dahal's colleague-turned-rivals despite his poor intellectual and political credentials. So went on the parade of offensive speakers.
Partisanship has become a norm rather than an exception in this country. With their excessive divisiveness, politicians and parties have poisoned everything from student councils to professional associations to trade unions to ex-army organizations to socio-cultural groups-you name it. Even civil servants and journalists are not spared; they have been divided into contending blocs each aligned to one big party; some are even associated with racial-communal outfits. With change of governments, heads roll even in state universities, academy of fine arts, literature, music and performing arts, Film Development Board and Sports Council to appoint party loyalists or cronies.
One reason for all this is historical. During the days of Panchayat authoritarianism, political parties were forced to mobilize cadres in the guise of members of professional unions such as student councils, bar associations, teachers or trade unions because parties as such were banned. Unfortunately, the practice continued, albeit with a different objective, even after the restoration of democracy in 1990. Because of their zero-sum mentality, the two big parties of the time - Nepali Congress (NC) and the CPN-UML - perceived that one's rise was possible only at the other's expense. Therefore, with an aim to outdo the other, they took the blight to new heights. With new players entering the ground, which include ethnic and communal groups, by the passage of time partisan offshoots multiplied both horizontally and vertically in the cover of civic and professional groups.
In our country too, civil societies played an active role in fighting the autocratic rule of King Gyanendra. But their role in exposing and cautioning against the wrongdoings of the political actors of post-2006 era have been hypocritical to say the least.
The other factor that nourished the partisan culture is ideological. Despite their rise, owing to the not-so-favorable conditions on domestic, regional and global fronts, hard-line communists were left with no choice but to engage themselves in the democratic polity of the nation, which didn't match with their schooling. All along, they had been orientated toward a one-party communist system where society and economy are controlled by the party. But the communist modus operandi could not be copied in a democracy; the party could not have a cell in factories, universities, academies of arts and institutes of sports the way they have in communist states.
An alternate has to be worked out to meet the purpose. UML - the communist mainstream of the 1990s now tuned to the norms of a democratic and pluralistic polity and society - chose therefore to penetrate massively into every walk of national life from political to socio-cultural to business. NC, the mainstream of the liberal democracy and 1 political force of the country for a long time, tried to imitate the UML practice, but lacked their communistic methods, zeal and skills. Therefore, NC too is to be blamed equally to have promoted the menace. And with the yet-to-be-transformed Maoists joining (read using) the mainstream politics, the peril has reached its pinnacle, thanks to their 'capture everything' ethos.
By fluke or by design, even the conscience keepers of the nation have been corrupted by the evils of partisanship. 1990s that saw the restoration of democracy in this country also coincided with the tremendous rise and activism of civil societies across the world, which was mainly triggered by the success of mass movements against the communist regimes of Eastern Europe during the 1980s.

Adhikari is just one of the victims of a crime surge targeting Kathmandu's affluent that has sprung up since Nepal's mainstream political parties made peace with former rebel Maoists earlier this year.
Although a bloody decade of civil war has ended, Kathmandu's middle and upper classes complain that for them, life is more dangerous than ever, with a decline in the heavy security presence that marked life during the revolt.
""Over the past few months, crime rates have increased in Kathmandu. The criminals' morale seems to be high because their actions remains unchallenged,"" Upendra Kanta Aryal, Kathmandu's top police officer told AFP.
""Compared to previous years, kidnappings and robberies have increased in the Kathmandu valley,"" said Aryal, chief of Kathmandu's Metropolitan Police Crime Department, adding that he could not give precise numbers.
Nepal's political instability, corruption and ineffective policing mean organized criminals in Kathmandu are having a field day.
""The gangs are taking advantage of the transitional period,"" Kosh Raj Koirala, crime reporter at the English-language Kathmandu Post, told AFP.
""The criminals are targeting rich businessmen, whose family members are kidnapped for ransom. Most of the cases have gone unnoticed as victims are reluctant to seek police help,"" said Aryal.
Nepal now has an interim alliance government, containing former rebels, and critics say the new government has not been firm enough in dealing with the deteriorating law-and-order situation.
Last week, unknown gunmen opened fire outside a casino in the centre of Kathmandu, and students went on strike after a university teacher was beaten to death on a busy road during an attempted early evening mugging.
Well-heeled Nepalis are being snatched from the busy streets during the day and many kidnapping victims are quietly paying ransoms without informing authorities, say police.
""The lack of communication between police and victims families has boosted the confidence of kidnappers and those involved in organised crimes as they remain unharmed and unchallenged,"" said Koirala, the crime reporter.
Adhikari's family decided to inform the police, who were able to find and release him, but the kidnappers had taken the key to his office and came back the same day and stole 4,000 dollars that was in a desk.
Business in Nepal's capital is dominated by Marwaris -- Indian-origin businessmen -- and they are targeted by the scores of criminal gangs who have ramped up their operations.
""Over the past few months, around 700 families have received threats by phone or letter, and at least 28 Marwaris have been kidnapped and released after paying the ransom,"" Pawan Mittal, a Marwari business leader, told AFP.
The ransoms demands range from 1,500 to 150,000 dollars depending on the wealth of the person -- and the frightened Marwaris are paying up, Mittal said.
""We prefer to keep the incidents secret and give in to the demands made by criminal gangs to avoid further trouble,"" said Mittal, chairman of the Marwari Sewa Samiti, a group working for the welfare of the Marwari community.
Police say they cannot do anything if people do not report crimes.
""Such incidents needs to be exposed to take prompt action. We have the expertise and resources to nab the kidnappers but unless people report the crimes we are helpless,"" said Aryal.
But for another Marwari businessman, the police need to be much more pro-active to prevent the rising crime wave.
""We are witnessing daylight robberies and abductions almost everyday. The police have totally failed to make their presence felt to the business community,"" said the businessman on condition of anonymity.

"3604",2005752,"Title: India - Nepal introduce I-card at porous border to check infiltration.rtf; Date: November 11, 2005 Friday 2:25 PM  EST; Text: Sonauli Border (Uttar Pradesh), Nov. 11 -- In a bid to check cross border movement of suspected Maoists and smugglers, India and Nepal will introduce a system of identity verification in several districts of northern Uttar Pradesh for those crossing the porous border.
  ID card system will come into force at the Sonauli point where Nepali citizens entering India will have to show their voter cards or any other government authenticated identification documents.
  It will be the same for Indian citizens who travel across the border for trade and other activities. For students, the authorities have relaxed the norms and directed them to show college identity cards.
  India had begun this pilot project in various districts to issue multi-purpose identity cards to its citizens along the porous border.
 The multipurpose national identity cards also aim to help check illegal immigration along the 1,600-kilometer border with Nepal.
  With the new Multi-purpose National Identitiy Cards (MNIC), the government aims to create and maintain a new population register, where bio data of each and every citizen would be stored.
  ""At present, the entry is being monitored at around 50 border points. We will make a list and release it at the block and district levels and then issue I-cards to the residents,"" said Rama Shanker Gupta, Nodal Officer, Nautanwa district.
  But local residents have denounced the development, saying there were several entry points and this move would only cause harassment to the citizens who travel.
  ""They should draw a line primarily and then fence the entire border. Once there is a cover, then people will know which are the real entry points and use only them to cross over. Otherwise the whole exercise will be futile and a sheer waste of public money and fooling people,"" said Madhav Dhimre, a Nepali citizen.
  Mohammed Yusuf, an Indian resident, said the exercise could prove futile as there were multi entry points to enter the country.
  ""If somebody falls sick or has any other problem, then they will be helpless. You know how helpful our country's policemen are. People who want to cross over to the other side of border will do so irrespective of any checking. It is because there are so many ways of crossing over like river and fields,"" he said.
  Under a 55-year-old treaty, citizens of both the countries have not needed a visa or passport for travel.
  India recently expressed fears of infiltration by Nepal's Maoist rebels.
  India has already announced doubling of its troops at porous border within two years.
  The 180 million rupees ($ 3.83 million) project would initially cover a few selected districts in 13 states and all the federally administered territories.
  Besides Pakistan and Bangladesh, India says illegal immigration thrives through third countries like Nepal and Bhutan with which India has no bar on citizens' travel, even without passport.

"6707",20082906,"Title: Deposed king of Nepal leaves palace, vows to remain in the country.rtf; Date: June 11, 2008 Wednesday 3:21 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's deposed king left Katmandu's main palace Wednesday night to begin life as a civilian in the newly declared republic but said he had no plans to leave the country.
Ousted King Gyanendra said he handed in his royal scepter and crown of peacock feathers, yak hair and jewels to the Nepali government as he left for one of his former summer palaces on a forested hill on the outskirts of Katmandu.
There, he will be protected by police but will otherwise live as any other Nepali albeit an incredibly wealthy one who some believe should still reign.
The former king pulled out of the palace gates in an armored black Mercedes car at about 8:45 p.m., followed by a police and army escort. A few loyalist onlookers shouted that Gyanendra should not leave, but most of the several hundred people gathered there were happy to see him go.
""I have no intention or thoughts to leave the country,"" Gyanendra said earlier in his first public statement in months. ""I will stay in the country to help establish peace.""
Gyanendra's throne was formally abolished last month, but Wednesday's move carries great symbolism in a nation that was ruled by Shah dynasty monarchs for 239 years.
""This marks the beginning of a new Nepal and the end of a dynasty that has done nothing but harm this country,"" said Devendra Maharjan, a farmer who came to Katmandu to see the king leave the palace. ""If it had not been for the kings, Nepal would probably not have remained a poor nation.""
Nepal was declared a republic last month after elections that saw the country's former communist rebels win the most seats in a special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution.
""I have accepted the decision,"" Gyanendra told reporters.
Speaking in a grand palace hall decorated with portraits of the Shah dynasty kings, stuffed tigers and ornate chandeliers, he said: ""I have done all I can to cooperate with (the government's) directives.""
The Narayanhiti palace has been Gyanendra's home since becoming king in 2001, after a palace massacre in which a gunman, allegedly the crown prince, assassinated King Birendra and much of the royal family before killing himself.
Government officials plan to turn the pink concrete 1970s palace into a museum.
After his brother's death, Gyanendra assumed the throne. But the killings helped pierce the mystique surrounding a line of kings who had once been revered as reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu.
No proof has ever surfaced that Gyanendra was involved in the massacre, but rumors have swirled for years that he was behind the slaughter.
On Wednesday, he dismissed the accusations as a baseless ""campaign to defame the royal institution.""
In 2005, Gyanendra seized power from a civilian government, a move that made him deeply unpopular. He said he needed total authority to crush the communist insurgency. But the rebellion intensified, and a year later massive protests forced Gyanendra to restore democracy, after which the rebels began peace talks.
The king does not leave public life a pauper, even if his palaces have been nationalized and his $3.1 million annual allowance cut.
Before assuming the throne, he was known as a tough businessman with interests in tourism, tea and tobacco. He also inherited much of his family's wealth after the palace massacre.
The government is letting Gyanendra live in the summer palace which was among the royal residences that were nationalized because the former king's son is living in the family's private Katmandu residence.

    For the elections, reliable and effective security arrangement  would be made while all necessary regulations, administrative  arrangement and means and resources would be made available, the  report said.
    This is stated in the Common Minimum Program of the interim  government presented by Minister for Peace and Reconstruction Ram  Chandra Poudel at the meeting of the Legislature-Parliament  Tuesday.
    According to the report, the property owned by late King  Birendra, Queen Aishwarys and their family would be used to set up a trust in the interest of the nation while all property received  by Gyanendra in his capacity as the King would be nationalized, as per the agreement reached between the eight parties.
    The government would also strive to garner international  support for guaranteeing the right of the Bhutanese living as  refugees in Nepal to return back to their homeland.
    It would also give full guarantee of peace and security to the  people and work to foil all kinds of regressive conspiracies aimed at obstructing the elections to the Constituent Assembly.
    As per the program, the interim government would implement  effectively the comprehensive peace agreement and take the peace  process ahead with determination. 
    All conflicts and problems arising in the country would be  resolved and managed peacefully through talks and dialogue.
    The agreement reached between the government of Nepal, the  Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the United Nations in  relation to management of army and arms would be implemented  effectively and the Maoist's ""People's Liberation Army""  cantonments would be made more organized, the report said.

The surgery on Laleh and Ladan Bijani, 28, could be scheduled as early as next week, said an official from the Raffles Medical Group though others have said it could be delayed until July.
The sisters have tried for years to persuade doctors to attempt the procedure. German doctors concluded in 1996 that surgery could kill one or both of the women because they share an artery that feeds blood to their brains.
Last year, doctors in Singapore said they believed the surgery was possible, but that the decision on whether to proceed would be left up to the twins.
""They seem determined to go through with this,"" Dr. Keith Goh, head of the team of surgeons working with the twins, said last December.
The hospital plans a news conference Monday to discuss the surgery.
X-rays and scans revealed two separate brains surrounded by one skull, doctors have said. If the surgery is successful, the women will be left with palm-sized cavities on their heads.
After a lifetime of sacrifices to accommodate each other, the women have said they do not want to live joined together any longer.
Their hopes of living separate lives were rekindled last year when they read about how Goh separated infant twins from Nepal who were similarly fused at the skull. The sisters arrived in Singapore on Nov. 20 from Iran for medical and psychological evaluations.
Laleh hopes the surgery will allow her to pursue her dream of working as a journalist in Tehran, while Ladan wants to earn a graduate degree in law and move back home with their parents in Shiraz.

THE KING
The News -- In a televised speech, King Gyanendra of Nepal conceded to demands that he restore Parliament, seemingly ending his 14-month takeover of power.
Behind the News -- The concession, which came after nearly three weeks of pro-democracy protests in which at least 13 people were killed, did little to end the political chaos in Nepal. A coalition of seven parties accepted the king's offer and even agreed on a prime minister. But Maoist rebels and street protestors denounced it, saying they doubted whether the king had agreed to a main demand, a referendum on a constitution that would decide the fate of the monarchy.
THE TERRORIST
The News -- A man who identified himself as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of Al Qaeda in Iraq, appeared in a video predicting ''defeat and humiliation'' for what he called the American ''crusader'' effort.
Behind the News -- Intelligence agencies concluded that it was indeed Mr. Zarqawi in the video, which is a resurfacing of sorts for the man believed responsible for scores of bombings in Iraq. The question was, why now? One suggestion was that it was a form of one-upmanship directed at Osama bin Laden, who released an audio tape two days before. There is thought to be a certain degree of rivalry between the two men, and Mr. Zarqawi may have been trying to remind the world how active he has been in recent years compared with Mr. bin Laden.
THE EX-C.E.O.
The News -- Kenneth L. Lay, founder and former chief executive of Enron, testified in his own defense at his fraud trial in Houston.
Behind the News -- Mr. Lay's first days on the stand were marked by an absence of the kind of charm he was known for during Enron's glory days. He was agitated with just about everyone: prosecutors, former colleagues, journalists, investors and even his own lawyer. He particularly bridled when, under cross-examination, a prosecutor suggested he had tried to tamper with witnesses. Mr. Lay's demeanor stood in sharp contrast to that of his co-defendant, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who despite a reputation for arrogance managed to keep his cool during his testimony.
THE SPOKESMAN
The News -- Tony Snow made his first appearance as President Bush's press secretary.
Behind the News -- Mr. Snow, a former Fox News commentator who at times has been critical of the president, is expected to bring a bolder, flashier style to the daily televised briefings at the White House. His appointment, part of a larger shake-up of the White House staff by the new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, was regarded as an acknowledgment that the administration needs a new, less scripted approach to dealing with the press.
THE COUNSELOR
The News -- Karl Rove, the president's senior counselor, made his fifth appearance before a federal grand jury in the C.I.A. leak case.
Behind the News -- Mr. Rove's testimony signaled renewed activity in the special prosecutor's investigation into how the name of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson, was revealed. For Mr. Rove it came at a delicate time. His role in shaping White House policy was recently reduced, and any legal concerns may distract him from his main mission, keeping Republicans in control in both houses of Congress through the midterm elections this fall.

The factory should float its share to the locals to involve them for its safety and smooth operation, directed Public Accounts Committee (PAC), while approving a report from subcommittee headed by the committee Rabindra Prasad Adhikari.
The committee has blamed both management and employees for the closure of the factory. ""Finance Ministry and Ministry of Industry both failed to monitor and operate the factory,"" committee members blamed, adding that both should have monitored it on regular basis and taken prompt action to avert the current crisis. The factory has also not prepared its audit report since the fiscal year 2008-09. PAC has questioned the motive of managing director of the factory for not preparing the audit report. ""The factory has to prepare and present audit report, even if the factory is not operational,"" the committee said, blaming the managing director for being incompetent. The PAC has also directed the factory to carry out auditing at the earliest possible and submit it.
The report has also asked the government to formulate short-term and long term action plan after a detailed study of its sustainability. Apart from, the committee has urged the government to replace the existing management board and bring in active and professional board. ""The government should operate the factory by appointing high level civil servant unless it recruits new members in the management board,"" the committee directed, asking the government to operate the factory at the earliest.
The government had in November 1964 set up JCF.

 Syangja [west Nepal]: Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari has urged the Maoists to be ready to sit for talks immediately after the Dashain festival.
 Deputy Prime Minister Adhikary said that the government was fully ready and capable for talks and the festival truce [now effective] should be taken as the starting point for talks.

He said that the talks would be successful if the Maoists came to the negotiating table by announcing a cease-fire and giving up abductions, money extortion and looting. Adhikari, who arrived here to participate in the concluding ceremony of the week-long Syangja Festival, warned of intensified military actions if the Maoists reject talks and stick to violence at a time when the government is ready for talks.

Excerpt from unattributed report headlined ""Nepal Maoist youth wing activists try to abduct journalist in capital"" published by Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 15 August
Kathmandu, 14 August: YCL [Young Communist League, Maoist youth wing] workers on Tuesday [14 August] tried to abduct Madhav Basnet, the press representative of the weekly Dristi, while at the same time threatening to kill him.
The YCL workers came in the afternoon [local time] to the weekly's office in the Bagh Bazar neighbourhood of the capital in a group of 12 and urged Basnet to come with them. When he refused and telephoned YCL central convenor Ganesh Man Pun, they went outside.
The group, which came on orders from YCL central member Prabhat and Solukhumbu [southern district] convenor Rajendra, also tried to surround the weekly's office.
Basnet was a Maoist worker till three years ago.
[Passage omitted: date on which he left the Maoist party]
Basnet has since then been working as a journalist in the capital. His former ""comrades in arms"" had come to abduct him.
[Passage omitted: names of those who came to abduct him]
Basnet said the Maoists had proposed that he join the party again. When he turned down the idea, they tried to abduct him.
""The abduction attempt was made after I wrote against the Maoists and turned down the proposal that I rejoin the party"", he told Kantipur.
Dristi has condemned the incident. Its editor, Shambhu Shrestha, said the doings of the YCL had made a mockery of press freedom. The Press Chautari [debate forum] has also denounced the incident.

Text of report in English by Japan's largest news agency Kyodo
Tokyo, March 6 Kyodo - The government decided Friday to extend Japan's peacekeeping mission in Nepal for an additional six months until Sept. 30.
The extension of the mission beyond the scheduled March 31 expiry is in response to a UN Security Council decision in January to extend a military observer mission to Nepal until July 23.
Six Self-Defence Force officers have been sent to Nepal since March 2007 to participate in the UN Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).
The dispatch to Nepal marked the first overseas deployment of SDF troops since the SDF's international cooperation activities were redefined as the troops' main duties rather than subordinate ones following the Defence Agency's upgrading to the Defence Ministry in January 2007.
Acting on the latest decision, six Ground Self-Defence Force troops will leave for Nepal in mid-March to replace the current ones.
UNMIN was established in January 2007 to assist with the Constituent Assembly elections in April 2008 and to help promote the peace process in Nepal.
The Nepalese government and Maoists signed a peace accord in 2006, ending their decade-long civil war that left more than 13,000 people dead.
The country has yet to work out a model to reintegrate into national security forces Maoist fighters confined to UN-monitored cantonments across the country.

"7022",2008958,"Title: Excitement, anxiety as Bhutan prepares for first big polls.rtf; Date: March 21, 2008 Friday 2:27 AM GMT; Text: As the tiny Himalayan state of Bhutan readies for its first major polls next week, many people are still apprehensive of the changes that the country's shift to democracy will bring.
The Buddhist kingdom will conduct elections for a lower house on Monday, bringing an end to absolute rule by the immensely popular King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk, who took over the kingdom from his father in 2006.
While some Bhutanese have remained indifferent to the election process so far, others have reservations about what the future holds.
""I am not sure if democracy is good or bad. If they change the laws, our culture will be lost under democracy,"" said Sangay, a 50-year-old farmer.
The isolated kingdom of just under 700,000 people has carefully preserved its traditions and culture -- making it mandatory for its citizens to wear traditional clothes, and allowing only limited industrialisation and tourism.
Many Bhutanese take a dim view of democracy.
""I see on television how people fight in other democracies. So far, Bhutan has been a peaceful country but after March 24, it will become like other countries,"" said house help Mani Lhamo.
Lhamo said -- like many others -- that she will not vote as reaching her remote constituency centre would take up to three days. ""Who will look after my cows if I go to vote?""
""People are apprehensive of change because monarchy has worked well so far. Many people see corruption and strife around them in other countries,"" said Kinley Dorji, managing director of the national Kuensel newspaper.
Officials are also concerned about security after a string of bomb blasts in the past month, suspected to have been carried out by communist rebels operating from neighbouring Nepal.
Two explosions have occurred in the last week alone, local police said.
Tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese fled from southern Bhutan to Nepal after a cultural campaign to encourage the use of Bhutan's national language and dress, and have been living in refugee camps.
""A group of people in Nepal camps are bent on disturbing the elections. We can't wish away these security concerns,"" said the country's chief election commissioner Kunzang Wangdi.
Around 10,000 police have been deployed, Wangdi said, and a 400-kilometre (250-mile) long border with India will be sealed a day ahead of polls to prevent militants from India's insurgency-hit northeast from crossing.
The two political parties -- the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT, Bhutan United Party) and People's Democratic Party (PDP) -- are trying hard to convince people to vote amid widespread apathy.
Last year's test polls saw 40 percent turnout, and 50 percent voters turned up for staggered elections for the upper house, the National Council, in December and January.
Candidates from the two parties have been going on long treks, which can take up to 10 days by foot in the rough hilly terrain, to reach the remotest villages to encourage people to cast their ballots.
Most of the political contestants have already served as ministers and bureaucrats in previous governments appointed by the king and command huge respect among the Bhutanese.
""My prayers go to you so that you serve a good government,"" a retired judge told DPT's prominent candidate Ugyen Tshering as he went for door-to-door campaigning.
Other voters are keen to share their problems with the candidates.
""The animals eat up the vegetables in my farm. The minister has promised to visit my house,"" said Daw Norbu, a 72-year-old farmer at a village meeting organised by PDP chief Sangay Ngedup.

"6871",20083111,"Title: India will continue working with new govts in Nepal , Pak.rtf; Date: April 19, 2008 Saturday 3:26 PM  EST; Text: New Delhi, April 19 -- India will continue working with the new governments in Nepal, Pakistan and Bhutan to ensure a stable and prosperous neighbourhood and will remain a factor for peace and stability in the region, Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon said today.
In his keynote address at the first 'IISS-Citi India Global Forum,' he said the destinies of the countries in the sub-continent were inter-linked and would stay so and India's major objective was to establish connectivity-mental and physical.
Asserting that a peaceful, stable and prosperous Pakistan at peace with itself, was in India's interest, he said New Delhi would continue to develop close political and economic relations with all its neighbours.
''The recent elections in Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan have served to underscore the potential contribution of multi-party democratic frameworks to peace and stability. India will continue working with the leaderships in these countries to enable each of us to pursue our shared objectives,'' he said.
''We will continue our efforts to develop close political and economic relations with all our neighbours. Our goal is a peaceful, stable and prosperous neighbourhood. India will continue to remain a factor for peace and stability in the region''.
The Foreign Secretary who was speaking on 'India as a Rising Great Power : Challenges and Opportnities', expressed concern at the unfortunate increase of violence in Sri Lanka and reaffirmed India's consistent position that there could be no military solution to the ethnic issue.
He stressed the necessity for a negotiated political settlement within the framework of a united Sri Lanka that is acceptable to all sections of society.
He reaffirmed India's continued assistance for Afghanistan's reconstruction programmes and for building a pluralistic society and hoped that democracy would soon return to Myanmar and Bangladesh.
One major objective was to establish better connectivity, he said and added that the resumption of rail links between Kolkata and Bangladesh after 43 years was testimony.
He said India recognised the need for expediting the process of national reconciliation and political reform in Myanmar to make it more inclusive.
Mr Menon said India's relations with China hinged on the mutual recognition that there was enough space and opportunity for both countries to grow and prosper.
Asserting that the 'Look East' Policy formed the pillar of India's engagement with ASEAN, he said substantial steps had been taken for integrating their economies, societies and institutions.
An India-ASEAN Fund with an initial corpus of one million US Dollars had been established and there was a proposal to set up an India-ASEAN Green Fund with a corpus of five million US Dollars.
At the global level, India's engagement was geared towards playing a positive role in world affairs and a strengthened and more democratic UN was the basic necessity of the new global order.
India's growing economy hoped to benefit from an open international trading regime and required an open rule-based international trading and investment environment, he said and added that India had a major interest in the success of the Doha Development Round.
''We will do what we can to make it a success and to see that the concerns of countries such as India and with large numbers of subsistence farmers are taken on board,'' he said.
Expressing concern at the spurt in food and oil prices and their effect on energy and food security, Mr Menon lamented that the world has yet to come to grips with these problems.
He also expressed concern at the changing nature of international security threats including terrorism and WMD proliferation and said India was ready to work with others to evolve a new international consensus to deal with these issues.
''We believe that non-proliferation and disarmament are mutually reinforcing processes. The most effective non-proliferation measure would be a credible programme for global verifiable and non-discriminatory disarmament,'' he added.

The protesters, who remained peaceful as hundreds of riot police kept watch, also want immediate parliamentary elections.
Similar marches have ended in violent clashes between police and the demonstrators.
Nepal has been hit by political turbulence since King Gyanendra fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in October 2002, accusing him of incompetence and failing to control an insurgency.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since 1996 for a communist state. More than 8,500 people have been killed.
The king has ignored the protesters demands.

Text of report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 20 June
[by Sangeeta Rijal]
Kathmandu, [Wednesday] 20 June: In an alarming development, HIV infection has increased by more than 100 per cent among women and by 200 per cent among children in the past 18 months, an official report revealed.
The number of HIV-infected housewives reached 1,883 on 14 May this year from 765 in December 2005, according to data available at the National Centre for AIDS and STD Control (NCASC). The data was analysed by the Family Planning Association Nepal (FPAN).
Similarly, the number of children infected with HIV reached 428 from 138 in the same period.
Sharing this information during training on ""sexual and reproductive health and rights"" organized by FPAN here Tuesday, Dr Giridhari Sharma Poudel, executive director of FPAN, said: ""It (HIV infection) has increased by 146.14 per cent among women and by 210.14 per cent among children within a short span of time."" ""The outbreak is not concentrated in certain groups now.""
According to the data, infection through blood transfusion or organ transplant has increased by 144.44 per cent while it increased by 47.66 per cent among the clients of sex workers.

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com website on 9 January
Kathmandu, 8 January: Ministers and royalists have said that the government should go ahead with polls even if there is human casualty, terming it a normal occurrence during elections. 
""The government should hold elections at any cost without worrying about disturbances or human casualty,"" Raj Parishad [Royal Privy Council] member and ex-army chief Sachit Sumsher Rana said on Sunday [8 January].
Similarly, Minister of Forest and Soil Conservation Salim Miya Ansari said that human casualties were a normal aspect during polls while the Maoists were launching violent activities. His colleague, State Minister for Water Resource Binod Kumar Sah backed the army's infiltration of the CPN-UML's [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified-Marxist-Leninist)] Baglung meeting, saying it was a state strategy while maintaining security.
Rana, meanwhile, said that Maoists should come forward for negotiation with the government by shunning violence, if they were in favour of peace and democracy in the country. ""If they agree to resolve the crisis through peaceful negotiation the arms and militia management is not a big issue,"" he said while speaking at the Reporters' Club Nepal. 
Referring to a previous instance Rana said: ""In 2007 BS too 3,000 freedom fighters were absorbed into the Royal Nepalese Army so arms management is nothing, first they should join the negotiating table."" Criticizing Indian leaders for making comment on the king's move Rana asked: ""If they are really sincere about democracy why are they maintaining silence towards Pakistan, Bhutan and Myanmar where there is no democracy?""

 Chief Maoist negotiator Dr Baburam Bhattarai said Sunday 30 March alleged American interference in Nepal could create problems for Nepal's immediate neighbours India and China.
 ""Such interference might create problems for India and China, our immediate neighbours,"" Dr Bhattarai told reporters.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 30 Mar 03""They (USA) should allow us to solve our problems ourselves,"" he said.
 Immediately after the 29 January cease-fire, a senior American diplomat said Washington will not allow Maoists to prevail in Nepal and could even declare them terrorists. The diplomat said Washington will help the government if peace talks fail for the second time in two years, while reiterating the USA supported negotiations only on humanitarian grounds. The United States has given Nepal moral, financial and military assistance to quell a seven-year communist insurgency…
 Dr Bhattarai said security forces Sunday violated a code of conduct to govern proposed peace talks by intervening at a meeting in west Nepal. He did not specify where the incident occurred.
 Dr Bhattarai took a direct swipe at the king for the second time in two days Sunday and even sounded contradictory as some analysts said Maoists have abandoned demands for a republic.
 ""If he (king) abdicates, it will be the best solution,"" Dr Bhattarai said. ""We will give him a due place.""
 Dr Bhattarai said Saturday: ""He will be lost into oblivion, should he fail. The king controls the old regime and we want him to play a role in the interest of the people.""

It has two roles, to open up wasteland and protect the frontiers, both aspects of national security. In peacetime the farming role becomes more important, and in times of tension the security role is more important. The two roles are inseparable. The corps is the biggest state organization on the mainland, after the People's Liberation Army. It has a unique status, with its own courts and legal system, and is subject to the authority of the PLA - not the regional government. Text of report by Mark O'Neill: ""Corps values endure on the mainland's Wild West frontier"", carried by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post web site on 8 November
 Fifty years ago, Mao Zedong ordered 175,000 soldiers to settle in the far western region of Xinjiang to secure the area for China against warlords, Kuomintang troops, Soviet and American agents, and those fighting for independence and an Islamic republic.
South China Morning Post web site, Hong Kong, in English 8 Nov 04
Half a century later, China enjoys good relations with its neighbours, the Taleban government has gone, and the military threat is negligible. But the body Mao created - the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) - has grown into one of the biggest institutions in China, with 2.54 million members, 1,500 companies and responsibility for 2,000km of the region's border.
 It is the only one of the 12 production and construction corps - all part of the People's Liberation Army - which China set up in the 1960s and 70s that still survives. Beijing abolished the others between 1972 and 1976.
 Why should the corps still exist when China's control over the region is more secure than it has ever been? None of its neighbours support the recreation of a separate government - the Republic of East Turkestan - that existed briefly before it was crushed by the communist army when it entered the region in 1949. All cooperate with Beijing in opposing such a state and hand back ""terrorists"" suspected of carrying out attacks.
 According to official figures, between 1990 and 2003, ""terrorists"" killed 160 civil servants and religious figures in Xinjiang, while the security forces killed 110 ""terrorists"" and dismantled 560 of their organizations.
 ""Compared to the early and mid-1990s, the threat of separatism has diminished,"" Wang Lequan, Communist Party chief of Xinjiang and political chief of the XPCC since December 1995, said last month. ""In recent years, friendly neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Russia have handed back many of these terrorists.""
 The exile movement of the Uighurs - the largest minority in Xinjiang with about 40 per cent of the population of 18 million - is weak and divided and lacks a leader with the charisma and global status of the Dalai Lama.
 Unlike the Tibetan leader, leaders of Uighur movements do not meet heads of state and are not invited to prime-time television shows. Beijing wages an unrelenting diplomatic and political war against them.
 In September, on the steps of the US Capitol building in Washington, a group of Uighur exiles announced the formation of a government-in-exile. The event was attended by just two media - the Far Eastern Economic Review and an official Chinese newspaper that will print nothing about it. Other Uighur exiled groups distanced themselves from the event.
 Despite this greatly reduced political and security threat, Zhang Qingli, the commander of the XPCC since October 1999, insisted that the corps was essential.
 ""The XPCC will live for a long time,"" he says. ""As long as we have enemies in the world who want us dead, as long as Xinjiang has separatists and religious extremists causing trouble, the corps will live forever. It has two roles, to open up wasteland and protect the frontiers, both an aspect of national security. In peacetime the farming role becomes more important, and in times of tension the security role is more important. The two roles are inseparable.""
 The corps is the biggest state organization on the mainland, after the People's Liberation Army. It has a unique status, with its own courts and legal system, and is subject to the authority of the PLA - not the regional government.
 In times of peace, the problems Mr Zhang has to deal with are less about border protection and catching bombers than the headaches of a city mayor or chief executive of a giant company. Like the state units of the Maoist era, it runs nurseries, schools, hospitals, old people's homes and many welfare services.
 Of the corps members, 450,000 are retired and 900,000 work, which means that only two active ones support one retired. But Mr Zhang has no powers to collect taxes or raise the corps' revenue.

Yushchenko's predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, last year signed a decree clearing the way for the troops to join the U.N. mission monitoring a three-decade cease fire between Israel and Syria.
More than 1,000 soldiers are currently serving in the Golan force, including peacekeepers from Austria, Japan, Nepal, Poland and Slovakia.
In December, the U.N. Security Council renewed the peacekeepers' mandate in the Golan Heights through June. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Middle East War and subsequently annexed it. Talks to return it to Syria as part of an overall Syrian-Israeli peace agreement broke down in 2000.
The statement, posted on parliament's Web site, said only that Yushchenko had requested the backing of parliament for the deployment. There was no indication of when lawmakers would consider the request and it was not immediately clear when Ukrainian soldiers would leave.
Ukraine has begun the withdrawal of its 1,650-strong contingent from Iraq where it serves as part of the U.S.-led coalition. Sixty-nine Ukrainian soldiers returned Friday and another 67 were scheduled to return Saturday, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
Ukrainian troops and military observers are also serving as a part of the NATO-led mission in Kosovo and in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, Georgia, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Liberia and the former Soviet republic of Moldova.
Last month, Ukraine completed a withdrawal of its peacekeeping contingent from the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone.

Excerpt from report by Nepalese eKantipur.com website on 7 November
Kathmandu, [Tuesday] 7 November: The summit talks between the seven-party alliance (SPA) and the Maoist leaders formally began at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's official residence at Baluwatar Tuesday morning.
The talks resumed this morning after the SPA and the Maoists failed to reach agreement on several contentious political issues. 
According to latest report from the PM residence, the afternoon's discussion saw the top leaders discuss the report presented by the task force of the seven parties. The leaders couldn't reach consensus over the issues of interim parliament and constituent assembly elections until late night Monday.
Talking to eKantipur over the phone, senior Nepali Congress leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that the much-awaited formal talks between the top SPA and Maoist leaders began this morning, with all the leaders starting discussion on the ""contentious political issues"" He did not mention what the contentious issues were. ""Today, we are hopeful all the issues will be sorted out,"" he said.
Today's talks are expected to sort out all differences between the SPA and the Maoists on all major issues including arms management and fate of monarchy, formation of an interim legislature and government. [passage omitted]
UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, during the informal meeting yesterday, demanded his party should get at least one more berth than the Maoists in the interim parliament.
Nepali Congress has 75 parliamentarians (including Upper House), UML 73 and NC (D) [Nepali Congress (Democratic)] 42, besides other smaller parties in the parliament. Earlier, the leaders had agreed to give 73 berths to the Maoists in the upcoming interim parliament. 
""But UML insisted it should get 74 berths and if that does not happen the Maoists should get only 72 berths,"" said deputy commander of the [Maoist] People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ananta.
The meeting had also decided to add 10 more seats for NC, UML and the Maoists and eight seats for the NC (D), putting the total number of seats for them at 85, 83, 83 and 52 respectively. However, NC-D president Sher Bahadur Deuba disagreed and demanded an equal number of extra seats for his party. [passage omitted]
Differences surfaced among the SPA and the Maoists also on the future of monarchy. [passage omitted]
On arms management, the seven parties and the Maoists expressed differences over the language to be used in the final draft while mentioning the issue of the arms management and the Maoist combatants. The seven parties said the draft should mention that the Maoist arms would be locked in storages within the designated cantonments. The UN will monitor the locks through close circuit camera, besides setting up sensor devices, which will sound the siren (or ring an alarm).
Similarly, the seven parties said the Maoist activities like extortion, display of arms in public and intimidation should be mentioned in the draft as punishable crimes. But Prachanda objected. The leaders couldn't reach an agreement over the language to be used regarding arms management and the Maoist combatants.
The seven parties and the Maoists yesterday agreed that the judges wouldn't be reappointed according to the interim constitution. However, they said the judges should take oath of the office as per the new constitution.

At least 445 people have been killed and millions have been affected in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan since the monsoon season began in mid-June.
Aid workers said 33 more people died in Pakistan, most in the southern Sindh province, as monsoon rains damaged hundreds of homes and ruptured a small dam.
Flash floods hit the western Indian desert state of Rajasthan after years of drought. Five children were washed away overnight when a flash flood engulfed a village and two other children drowned in a reservoir, Press Trust of India reported.
Four adults also died, including two women who were struck by lightning, police Supt. Govind Gupta was quoted as saying by PTI.
Two people drowned Thursday night in the Samastipur area of India's eastern Bihar state, local police said. All the major rivers in the state were flowing at dangerous levels, officials said.
Hundreds of thousands of people were affected across the state, police and government officials said. Homes and roads have been submerged, cattle have drowned, and people driven from their villages to higher ground.
Floodwaters have damaged or washed away thousands of flimsy huts and sections of mud levees along river banks. Surging waters have also drowned livestock, swamped rice fields, submerged roads and rail tracks, disrupting communications.
Two people died in northeastern Assam state, where the floods have affected 4.7 million people and killed 22 since last month in more than 4,600 villages, a flood relief official said on condition of anonymity. A 25-year-old man and 17-year-old girl were killed when their boat capsized in a whirlpool at the village of Charbori in Assam.
Boats are the only means of communication and transportation for villagers in far-flung, submerged areas during the annual monsoons, he said.
Flooding and landslides from heavy rains have stranded about 7 million people in South Asia since mid-June, relief officials said.

The students attacked three government offices and damaged at least 10 vehicles, including a car belonging to the Japanese Embassy in Nepal during the ""Rautahat bandh"" (general strike in Rautahat district in central Nepal) called by eight student unions.
""They broke into the administration office, the women development office and the soil conservation office in the district, damaging chairs, tables and official papers,"" the independent English daily quoted a local police officer as saying.
Police arrested 17 students involved in the attack. ""No one was injured in the clash,"" the officer said on condition of anonymity.
The strike affected Rautahat district completely as all shops, education institutions, private offices and transportation remained closed throughout the day.
Similarly, in Biratnagar, the largest city in eastern Nepal, students affiliated to the anti-government insurgents vandalized some colleges in the city.
The demonstrating student unions also declared closure of all private colleges, boarding schools as well as the universities of Kathmandu, Pokhara and Purbanchal on Thursday to protest against the recent hike in the price of petroleum products and the killing of a student leader.
The student leader was shot dead on the spot last week and six others were wounded last Tuesday when local policemen opened fire to control the demonstrators, who destroyed government vehicles and clashed with the policemen in Butwal town in western Nepal.

At a press conference in the capital, Krishna Prasad Dangal 'Kiran', coordinator, struggle committee, Former People's Liberation Army Nepal, blamed the political parties and the government for forcing them to launch an agitation by ignoring their charter of demands. Handed over to the government on July 4 with a one-month ultimatum and to the UCPN-Maoist chairman later, the charter seeks job opportunities and basic facilities for the former fighters, the removal of 'disqualified' tag, timely drafting of a pro-people constitution and proper care for the PLA fighters, who were injured or handicapped during the decade-long insurgency.
The PLA fighters also demanded that the government furnish information on disappeared comrades and provide relief package to their families.
The group is to organise a torch rally from Koteswor and a corner meeting at New Baneswor on August 7, and enforce a chakkajam from 9 till 11 am on August 8.
A general strike in the Valley on August 12 and nationwide strike on August 19 are also part of the protest.
A total of 4,008 combatants gradually left the cantonments after the verification process tagged them as 'disqualified'. However, others are still there in the camps - waiting for army integration and the start of a rehabilitation process.

""We have 245 Tibetans currently in detention from protests this morning in front of the UN,"" senior police officer Sharad Karki told AFP.
Police used bamboo batons to break up a crowd of about 500 Tibetan protesters carrying placards calling for a ""Free Tibet,"" an AFP reporter at the scene said, adding that a few appeared to have sustained injuries.
""We will continue our protests. Chinese should not be allowed to kill Tibetans,"" Kesang Dolkar, 38, told AFP before being taken away in a police van.
Protests have been held nearly every day in Kathmandu since unrest erupted on March 14 in Lhasa, capital of the Tibetan region, prompting a crackdown by security forces.
The prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala, India, told AFP on Monday that about 130 people have been confirmed killed in the crackdown in China's Tibet region.
China said Saturday that 18 ""innocent"" civilians and one police officer were killed in the rioting in Lhasa, raising its official death toll from 13.
Nepal officially recognises the ""One China"" policy that says Tibet, overrun by Chinese troops in 1951, and Taiwan, still regarded as a ""renegade"" province, are indivisible parts of the country.
About 20,000 Tibetan refugees have lived in Nepal after the Dalai Lama fled to India from the remote Himalayan region in 1959 following a failed uprising against the Chinese.

 Reporters Without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres) strongly condemned abuses inflicted on journalists in Nepal caught between rebels and government, as Maoists kidnapped a third journalist.
 Some seven journalists have been physically assaulted in the past two weeks and the worldwide press freedom organisation said it was very concerned about the plight of Shakti Kumar Pun abducted by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).
 It called on the party's leadership not to abduct or harass, and to release Pun, whose kidnapping ran contrary to commitments made by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who in September 2004 ordered his forces to release all journalist hostages and promised an end to violence against the press.
 Pun, correspondent for the national daily Rajdhani, was kidnapped with five other people by a group of rebels in Rukum district in the mid-west of the country. It is not clear exactly when they were abducted but local journalists said it took place sometime around 18 November.
Reporters Sans Frontieres press release, Paris, in English 25 Nov 04
The Maoists admitted kidnapping them to question them without giving any details about where they were being held. They suspected them of collaborating with the army in the arrest of five Maoist leaders last August.
 The same Maoist party is holding two other journalists hostage : Dhana Bahadur Rokka Magar, presenter on Radio Nepal, kidnapped in August 2002 by rebels in the west of the country and Kul Bahadur Malla, correspondent for the newspaper Karnali Sandesh in the west, abducted in June 2003.
 The Maoists murdered kidnapped journalist Dekendra Raj Thapa of Radio Nepal in August 2004 on the grounds that he was a ""spy"".
 Reporters Without Borders is also dismayed by repeated violence against the media by members of the military and the police.
 ""It is something of a paradox to see the government giving journalists' associations financial help for reporters who are victims of abuse and then allow security forces to assault journalists with complete impunity,"" it said in a letter to Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba.
 ""The fight against impunity should be your government's first priority, the organisation's secretary-general added.
 Three journalists received death threats connected to their reporting in the week of 15 November from a criminal, Susheel KC, who is protected by some local authorities in Nuwakot, north of Kathmandu. They were : Dhruba Kumar Rawal, reporter on the daily Rajdhani and Radio Nepal, Devchandra Bhatta, of the daily Nepal Samacharpatra and Raju Mitra Khanal of the daily Himalaya Times.
 Pashupati Ghimire, editor of the weekly News Post published in Dharan, in the east of the country, was manhandled by agents of the security forces in a bus between Barahakshetra and Dharan. The journalist was then forced out and had to complete his journey on foot.
 Producer of the programme ""Samay Chakra"" on Radio Nepal, Prakash Pokharel, has suffered two recent attacks. Businessman Jaya Bhola Shrestha assaulted him on 7 November in Butwal in the west. Then a few days later soldiers in Gulmi, also in the west, assaulted him without any fault.
 Soldiers in civilian clothes assaulted and issued death threats against Prakash Mathema, a photographer with press group Kantipur in south-western Kapilvastu on 9 November. They were angry over publication of one of his photos on the paper's front page the previous day showing an army patrol in which one soldier was carrying a fellow solider who had been wounded in the leg.
 Finally, on 4 November, a group of police officers attacked Surya Bahadur Chanda, of government daily Gorakhapatra in Kanchanpur district in the far-west while he was on a reporting assignment, opposite the offices of the Nepal Electricity Authority.

"3784",2005856,"Title: US envoy urges Nepal 's king and political parties to mend fences.rtf; Date: May 11, 2005 Wednesday 1:31 PM GMT; Text: A senior US diplomat Wednesday urged Nepal's King Gyanendra, who seized power 100 days ago, and political parties to bury the hatchet and concentrate on tackling an increasingly bloody Maoist insurgency.
""The threat is so large it's time for political parties and the palace to move forward together,"" Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca said at a news conference at the end of a three-day trip.
Rocca, the highest level US official to visit since King Gyanendra seized power, said that a few years ago Maoist rebels were only active in 30 districts but now enjoyed a presence in 72 out of the 75 districts in the impoverished Himalayan nation.
""The palace and parties need to pull together to find a sustainable peace,"" she said.
Rocca said there could be no military solution to the nine-year-old revolt aimed at installing a communist republic that has claimed over 11,000 lives.
""The Maoist problem has to be resolved at the negotiating table,"" said Rocca, whose visit coincided with some of the deadliest fighting reported between rebels and troops since the king's February 1 takeover.
Nepal's army said hundreds of rebels stormed two bases overnight Monday, sparking battles that killed at least 37 guerrillas and four members of the security forces.
Earlier Rocca called for elections and ""true multi-party democracy"" as soon as possible and warned failure to probe human rights abuse complaints could ""jeopardise our (US) ability to continue assistance.""
She added US military aid to Nepal's badly-equipped army was still under review since the king took control, saying the move was necessary because squabbling parties had failed to end the insurgency.
The United States spent 10 percent of its 45 million dollars of aid to Nepal in 2004 on security that included arms and training for Nepal's army. This year, 1.5 million dollars has been set aside for that purpose.
Rocca met King Gyanendra Wednesday morning after holding talks with Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey and chief of army staff General Pyar Jung Thapa.
She said she had expressed Washington's ""firm belief reconciliation between the government and political parties is crucial if Nepal is to move toward functional democracy and to address the brutal Maoist insurgency"" and called her discussions ""productive.""
She also urged the government to free ""all political detainees, to restore civil liberties.""
Soon after her appeal, authorities freed four senior politicians arrested after the king's takeover -- three belonging to the Nepali Congress and one to the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist Leninist party.
But hours later a powerful anti-corruption commission set up by the king ordered the detention for five more days of former premier Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was fired by the king, and his ex-works minister Prakash Man Singh.
Deuba, arrested two weeks ago and being held on corruption charges, has accused the panel of a vendetta against opponents of the king's takeover.
The government has been freeing some political leaders and activists since King Gyanendra lifted emergency rule nearly two weeks ago but human rights groups say hundreds remain in detention.
The acting president of the Nepali Congress-Democratic party, Gopal Man Shrestha, said he told Rocca at a meeting ""not to be misled by false pledges of the government when civil liberties still remain suspended.""
""The government needs to release all political activists to prove it really is easing restrictions,"" he said.
Meanwhile, there was criticism of India's decision Tuesday to start releasing military supplies to Nepal. India and Britain suspended arms shipments after the king's takeover.
It ""cannot be seen as a positive move for the restoration of democracy,"" said former communist minister and constitutional expert Nilambar Acharya.
""Weapons from India will help to prolong the direct rule of the king.""

In his first foreign trip since taking over the post last month, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh arrived in the capital Katmandu for talks that are expected to include security issues and a growing communist insurgency in the Himalayan kingdom.
""The first priority of our foreign policy is further improving and strengthening our relations with our neighbors,"" Singh told reporters.
""It is no coincidence that Nepal is the first country I am visiting after assuming office. It reflects the importance we attach to Nepal and our desire to consolidate and further develop our already wide-ranging ties.""
Singh's visit comes at a time of political turmoil and insurgency in Nepal.
The Himalayan nation got a new prime minister Wednesday, when the king reappointed Deuba, who was ousted from the top job two years ago, hoping to end a political crisis that has sparked huge demonstrations in recent months demanding that the monarch restore democracy.
Gyanendra accused Deuba in 2002 of failing to end a Maoist insurgency. The king dissolved Parliament, assumed executive powers and appointed a monarchist government.
Nepal has been fighting a Maoist insurgency since 1996, which has claimed more than 9,500 lives.
On Thursday, Indian police in the eastern city of Patna arrested 10 Nepalese citizens who are suspected leaders of Nepal's Maoist rebel group. The six are members of the guerrillas' central committee, its highest decision-making body, said rebel leader Prachanda.
The detentions are a boost for Nepal's government, which has been struggling to contain the growing insurgency.
India is providing military hardware to Nepal to fight the Maoists, who have close links with communist rebels operating in India's east and south.

  Things haven't changed much to this day, except that real guns are being replaced by replicas, thanks to ""cost-cutting measures"" by underground outfits.
  Rebel groups in the Northeast went corporate years ago - introducing graded salaries for members and perks linked to productivity (read subversion) - and reaped the benefits of outsourcing terror. They have also slashed expenses, like opting for cheaper but no less effective arms.
  Fake AK-47s like Calvin Klein, Reebok or Rolex look-alikes trickling in from across the border are flooding Indian consumer markets. The existence of a gunrunning racket dealing in fake AK-series automatic weapons came to light on Monday night, when drug enforcement officials apprehended three ganja-laden trucks near Tezpur. The trucks, bearing armed forces insignia and manned by 12 BSF personnel, yielded 9,326 kg of ganja worth Rs 4.75 crore and eight AK-47s - five of them duplicates. The Bureau of Revenue Intelligence officials said the consignment from Manipur was destined for Bihar and Jharkhand.
  ""We have reason to believe the fake guns were meant either for Naxalites or Nepal Maoists,"" an official said. ""We have passed on the information to the police and it is up to them to coordinate with their counterparts in the states.""
  An Assam police officer said the recovery of fake AK-47s could mean that they were either being manufactured in the region or smuggled in from Myanmar and beyond. ""These are cheaper alternatives for insurgents,"" he said.
  Based on the statements of the 12 ganja traffickers, the police are on the lookout of more consignments of fake AKs in ganja-laden trucks entering Assam from Manipur and Nagaland.

"6914",20084089,"Title: Chinese, Tibetan cultural rift grows after riots.rtf; Date: March 27, 2008 Thursday 5:42 AM GMT; Text: Yang Su, a Han Chinese clothing merchant in the country's remote northwest, closes his shop well before dark out of fear of revenge attacks by Tibetans.
""Relations between us are really not very good, it's very unstable now,"" said Yang, 25, who grew up playing with Tibetans in this small town surrounded by towering mountains that mark the start of the Tibetan plateau.
""The older people, the ones dressed in the traditional Tibetan robes are basically honest, but the younger generation, they are unreasonable,"" Yang told AFP, after three Tibetans dressed in jeans and T-shirts came into his store.
They asked Yang to exchange a pair of ripped pants bought the day before, a request he refused before agreeing to have them mended.
Relations between the Han, China's principal ethnic group, and Tibetans have never been perfect in this tiny trading post in Qinghai province.
But after more than two weeks of deadly riots in Tibetan-populated areas across western China, mutual distrust here has spiked, defying China's official claims of ethnic harmony under Communist Party guidance.
Guinan was spared the worst, but only thanks to a show of military force.
Monks at the town's Lucang monastery said armed soldiers surrounded the three-century-old temple where 300 Tibetan monks live and pray.
""They locked us in for several days because they feared we would demonstrate,"" a 20-year-old monk told AFP. ""It really has made us feel uncomfortable.""
Demonstrations in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on March 10 -- the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule -- escalated in the following days into deadly violence that spilled into adjacent regions.
China has responded with a massive military crackdown. Tibet's government-in-exile said Wednesday that the unrest had caused at least 135 deaths and left 1,000 injured.
China, which maintains it has exercised restraint amid huge international pressure, says 20 people have died, 19 of them in the Tibetan capital.
Soldiers in Guinan have since moved to Tibetan-dominated regions further south, where several protests have been reported by activist groups.
Their departure left Han and Muslim Chinese, who control almost all business activity in Guinan despite being in the minority, on edge.
""We are still closing our shops early and we don't serve Tibetans alcohol,"" said a restaurant owner who has lived in the region for 20 years.
While Beijing claims that Tibet has always been part of China, locals here have a more subtle understanding of history.
""This has traditionally been Tibetan land,"" said Yang, the clothing store owner.
Qinghai is known by Tibetans as Amdo, an ancient part of their homeland.
The province was officially created in the 1920s, while other parts of Amdo went to Sichuan and Gansu provinces after China officially annexed Tibet in 1951.
""Qinghai has been administered by China for so long, I think China should continue to do so,"" Yang said, while noting: ""Tibet is different. It was a tributary nation.""
According to most accounts, Tibet -- like ancient Korea, Vietnam and sometimes Nepal -- at various points in its 1,400 year history paid homage to the Chinese emperor while retaining control over its internal affairs.
It is a point of view that Pang Pang, 40, a Tibetan private car driver and life-long resident of Guinan, supports.
""We all read our history books. Tibet was an independent country before,"" said Pang, who used the Chinese transliteration of his Tibetan name.
""All Tibetans think about independence, but we cannot speak out. If we speak out over independence they will blow our heads off.""

"2876",20044753,"Title: South Asia has low AIDS rates but conditions 'ripe' outside India.rtf; Date: July 6, 2004 Tuesday; Text: South Asia has a low overall prevalence of AIDS but lack of sexual awareness coupled with intravenous drug use made conditions outside India ripe for the spread of the virus, a UN official said Tuesday.
India has 5.1 million people living with HIV, the largest number in the world apart from South Africa, but it represents only a small proportion of its one billion-plus population.
""What we see in South Asia is that the overall prevalence rate is low which is encouraging, but we see concentration of the epidemic in marginalised populations -- like intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men -- which should alarm us,"" warned Purnima Mane, director of the Social Mobilisation and the Information Department of UNAIDS in Geneva.
The spread of HIV/AIDS through intravenous drug use was affecting Nepal, Pakistan and several states of India's northeast, she said.
""Injecting drug use needs to be looked at very carefully,"" she told a press conference in New Delhi where a new UNAIDS report was released.
Though most infections were through unprotected sex, injecting drug use in India's north-east bordering Myanmar and close to the notorious Golden Triangle drug-producing area saw HIV infection rates of up to 75 percent, the UN report said.
Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, project director of the National AIDS Control Organisation, said Tuesday India had successfully brought down new HIV infections with a multi-faceted strategy.
""India recorded 520,000 new HIV cases in 2003, down from 610,000 in 2002, she said adding, ""The drop in new infections in 2003 is proof that India's anti-AIDS campaign is working.""
India launched its biggest anti-AIDS operation after announcing last year's figures, with the then-Hindu nationalist-led government speaking openly for the first time of the need to use condoms.
A study three years ago found that a quarter of the Indian population had never even heard of AIDS, the UNAIDS report said.
Elsewhere in south Asia ""behavioural information suggests that conditions are ripe for HIV to spread,"" according to the report.
In Bangladesh, despite currently low HIV rates, a rise in drug use in some areas, a highly active commercial sex trade and the widespread shunning of birth control threatens a spike in infections.
Surveys there showed fewer than 20 percent of married women and 33 percent of married men had heard of AIDS.
""In Bangladesh, the interesting thing is that the country has taken the epidemic seriously. It has a very small epidemic which has continued to remain small,"" Mane said.
""But they have recognised that they have a situation which is hidden -- of men who have sex with men. And because it is hidden, it is almost inaccessible for prevention programmes. They have recognised that this is a serious issue for a country that has such high levels of poverty,"" she said.
The UN report noted the first outbreak of HIV infection among intravenous drug users in Pakistan was reported in 2003. Few had heard about AIDS and even fewer had ever used a condom.
Pakistan at present has a estimated adult prevalence of 0.1 percent, it said.
The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka has been quite low, Mane said. ""The problem is with sex workers, especially young boys and paedophilia,"" she added.
However, the UN official was critical of ""the policies in many of these countries which are not as open as they should be for many of the marginalised populations"" of HIV infected.
""What one has to remember is to be careful not to be complacent and say the epidemic is small and so no need to worry,"" she said.
""The time to worry is when it small because that is when you can make a difference by keeping it small.""

The announcement came Tuesday after the local media quoted student union officials as saying plans for the strike had been scrapped following appeals from schools and businesses who said the stoppage would be too disruptive.
The student union described the reports as baseless.
""We have decided to go ahead with our plan to call a general strike from February 25 to 29 and we call upon all to help make our plan a success,"" it said in a statement.
Nepalis often heed the frequent strike calls by the Maoists or groups backing them as much out of fear of reprisals as support for their cause.
The impoverished nation has been in the grips of an increasingly deadly revolt by the rebels who have been fighting since 1996 to topple the monarchy and install a communist republic.
The rebellion has so far claimed more than 9,000 lives.
The crisis deepened in 2002 when King Gynanendra dismissed the elected government, saying it was incompetent to tackle the insurgency.

Text of report by Nepalese state-owned newspaper Gorkhapatra on 26 January
Kathmandu, 25 January: The security forces repulsed groups of Maoist terrorists who came from different directions and made attempts to launch attacks on security forces based at Nepalgunj of Banke district [mid-west Nepal].
After clashes that erupted last evening [24 January], four bodies of the rebels and a pistol were recovered, according to the Defence Ministry.
Three security personnel were killed during the battle. The Defence Ministry has paid tributes to the brave soldiers who died in action.
An Indian national, 60-year old Sikandar Bagban, was killed when the Maoists fired randomly at Nepalgunj Bazar. The rebels were trying to launch their attack on security bases there.
The Defence Ministry said that division, dispute and desertion are growing within the Maoist rebel organization. In the latest example, the chief of the so-called district people's government of Sankhuwasabha Suresh Dahal, alias Sujan, ran away from the party along with 10 million rupees looted from civilians.
Former rebels Ram Krishna KC of Dolakha, Radhika Sherpa and Ganga Sherpa of Taplejung and Manju Kumal and Nil Bahadur Bhandari of Jumla have surrendered to the local administration, according to the ministry.
The security forces defused bombs planted by the rebels at a roadblock at Siddhartha highway in Rupandehi district. After the bombs were defused the road obstruction was cleared.
Meanwhile, the security forces arrested two people affiliated with the terrorist organization in Baitadi district [far-west Nepal].
According to the far-western division headquarters of the army, the two were arrested in possession of a pistol during a security check. They told the security forces that they had run away from the rebels.
Sher Bahadur Tamrakar alias Kishor was arrested in Baitadi while he was intimidating local people.
Security forces have confiscated a pistol, five pressure cooker bombs, a bucket bomb weighing 7 kg and three detonators during a search operation at Galphe Bazar area of Darchula district.
Meanwhile, the security forces foiled another attempt of the Maoist rebels to attack the town of Dhangadhi in far-west Nepal. The rebels had launched a simultaneous attack at different security base camps. The rebels were repulsed after 45 minutes of clashes. No losses were suffered by the security forces.

[Sourced to Himalayan News Service]
Biratnagar, 19 January: The seven political parties held a general meeting here today, voiced their commitment to holding the constituent assembly [CA] polls slated for 10 April and vowed to resort to armed struggle if any attempt was made to spike the polls.
Speaking during the general assembly in Shahid Rangshala, leaders of the seven parties tendered a public apology for failing twice to hold the CA polls. They also said that the Terai [southern plains] issues would be resolved once the polls are held.
Senior Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai warned that the CPN-Maoist would launch an armed revolution again if the CA polls were spiked and added that the seven parties also would support the revolution. 
""The Maoists have laid down their arms, but they have not forgotten their expertise in making explosives,"" said Dr Bhattarai. He said that the CA polls would be the crematorium of the monarchy and added that the first session of the elected CA would ""light the funeral pyre of the monarchy"". He also alleged that the army was engineering acts like bomb explosions, fires in buses and other incidents across the country.
CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said the seven parties were committed to holding the CA polls on 10 April. Alleging that vested interests were trying to protect the monarchy, Nepal said: ""Time does not look back. It goes forward. People want a republic.""
Nepali Congress general secretary Bimalendra Nidhi said that the CA polls would ensure the resolution of the Madhes [i.e. Terai] issues. ""If the Madhesis want representation in government, they should participate in the CA polls,"" he said. Amik Sherchan said the rights of the Nepalis would be ensured once monarchy was terminated.
Nepal Sadbhawana Party senior vice-president and Minister Shyam Sundar Gupta appealed to the Madhesi people to take part in the polls. Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party leader Sunil Prajapati condemned [Minister without Portfolio] Sujata Koirala's pro-monarchy statement. Sanyukta Bam Morcha president C.P. Mainali assured of his party's support for a sea change in the policies of the country. 
Eastern zone Deputy Inspector-General of Police Rabindra Pratap Shah said the security measures were heightened in view of the series of blasts here recently. Six hundred buses were pressed into service to bring the party cadres to the venue who stayed put though it started raining a little after the convention began.
A little while later, the rain stopped but tension prevailed for a while when a blast occurred 100 metres away from the venue. No other untoward incident was reported.

U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said peacekeepers who monitor a demilitarized zone set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War between Iraq and Kuwait reported ""numerous violations,"" since Tuesday ""by personnel in civilian clothes in 4 x 4 vehicles, at least some of whom were armed and identified themselves as U.S. Marines.""
Marine Maj. David Andersen, a public affairs officer for the U.S.-led coalition command center in Kuwait City, said the Marines were investigating the report.
Col. Youssef al-Mullah, spokesman for Kuwait's Defense Ministry, told The Associated Press: ""This is Kuwaiti land, and if we deem that any changes should be done to the fence in the interest of defending the country, we will do them.""
Eckhard said peacekeepers observed three breaches that had been cut in an electric fence that Kuwait erected after a U.S.-led coalition forced Iraqi troops out of the country in 1991. The peacekeepers didn't see the Marines cut the fence but believe the Marines did so.
In one incident on Tuesday, observers saw four men in a car near the fence, said Daljeet Bagga, a spokesman for the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM).
The men identified themselves as U.S. Marines who were cleared by Kuwaiti authorities to be in the area, Bagga said.
The men told observers they were testing radio equipment, Bagga said. They were not seen working on the fence, he added. A gap was found in the fence near the site later in the day, though Bagga said he could not confirm the Marines were responsible.
He said, however, that Kuwait has been making extra openings in the fence. In the last two days, workers from Nepal and India have made seven new gaps and have been installing gates on them.
The 120-mile fence already had 19 gated openings.
""We have not seen anyone in uniform,"" at the sites of the new openings, Bagga said.
He said UNIKOM has reported the seven new gaps to the United Nations and asked the Kuwaiti government for an explanation.
""We are concerned about this,"" he said ""We were not informed about it.""
Kuwaiti officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
Eckhard said the complaint was sent to the Security Council in the form of a letter from the U.N. peacekeeping department. Eckhard said the breach may violate the Security Council resolution that set up the zone but that it was up for the council to make that determination.
The United States has amassed more than 300,000 troops in the region in preparation for another possible war with Iraq. In the meantime, it is pushing council members to adopt a new resolution that would authorize military force, as it did in 1991.

Incidentally, the Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is scheduled to visit India that day.

 The West Bengal government is taking steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Apart from sounding an alert along its open border with Nepal, the state authorities have instructed the Darjeeling district administration to step up measures to prevent Maoist rebels from sneaking into the district.

  Sabauddin alias Abu Qasim was arrested by the Special Task Force of Uttar Pradesh police here on Sunday.
  Studying Bachelor of Computer Applications (BBA), Sabauddin was among six persons arrested in connection with the CRPF camp attack that killed seven jawans and a civilian. Among the others caught were Suhail and Jung Bahadur alias Baba, both from Uttar Pradesh, and Faheem Ahmad Ansari, a Pakistani. They were arrested at a bus stand in Rampur when they were about to leave for Mumbai, sources said. In Lucknow, Abu Jar and Abu Sama alias Adeel, both from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, were arrested.
  The police believe Sabauddin, who hails from Bihar, was also behind the December 2005 shooting at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in which an IIT Delhi professor was killed. The terror team's next assignment was to target Mumbai's stock exchange and some key installations at Church Gate. He had planned to travel to Mumbai on Monday.
  The police believe that on the basis of information provided by Sabauddin, militant outfit Lashkar-e-Tayyeba planned the attack on the IISc campus.
  Sabauddin was believed to have brought suicide bomber Hamza to Bangalore from Kathmandu after procuring sophisticated arms from Kashmir. Immediately after the ""successful strike"" at the IISc, Sabauddin moved to Nepal.
  What alarmed the cops was how an alleged terrorist managed to get admission in a reputed college ""so easily"". Sabauddin, it is believed, enrolled after bribing college officials. DGP Vikram Singh said: ""Sabauddin had received training from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyeba in 2002 and was an expert in precision shooting and handling of sophisticated weapons.""
  After training, he was directed by the Lashkar to work for the ISI. He also met the ISI's Lieutenant Colonel Biyani who sent Sabauddin for four months of specialised weapons training. The ISI got a Pakistani passport made for Sabauddin. Subsequently, he returned to Bangalore.
  He was then directed to attack a military convoy that passed through Rampur and Bareilly for which he contacted Suhail alias Sajid, who had received training in Pakistan. They failed to carry out the ""attack"", but Sabauddin got the nod from the ISI to attack the CRPF camp in Rampur.
  The person who provided the ""back- up support"" to Sabauddin for the Rampur attack was Baba, a dhaba-and PCO shop owner on the Rampur highway. Senior officials said Sabauddin had good knowledge of computers. The Karnataka police also wants to interrogate Sabauddin for the IISc attack. ""A team left for Lucknow to secure this militant and interrogate him here. He has admitted that he was in the city (Bangalore) when the attack on the science institute was planned,"" DGP K.R. Srinivasan said on Sunday.

"7354",20111922,"Title: Sugam Gas will be punished_ Minister Bhatta.rtf; Date: November 11, 2011 Friday; Text: ITAHARI, Nov. 11 -- Minister for Commerce and Supplies Lekh Raj Bhatta on Friday vowed to take action against Sugam Gas Company (SGC) and its proprietor Shiva Prasad Ghimire for risking the lives of consumers.
""Ghimire will not be spared. If local administration does not act strongly, other market inspection authorities will punish him,"" said Bhatta.
Even though Ghimire was caught red-handed by Bureau of Standards and Metrology (BoSM) while refitting foot and neck rings of SGC on other companies' cylinders, MoI has been lenient and has avoided scrapping SGC's operating license in line with previous Industry Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara direction.
BoSM had dug out SGC's anomaly when it conducted a raid at Nepal Petroleum Trade Link, another company belonging to Ghimire, on May 5 this year. The raid had confirmed SGC was illegally collecting cylinders of competitors and circulating them as SGC cylinders by replacing their foot and neck rings.
As such, tampering of cylinders substantially weakens their capacity to withstand pressure and render them prone to leakage and explosion, it exposed some 25,000 customers to life-threatening risks. They could have met with accidents anytime.
The SGC action masterminded by Ghimire flouted competition laws, code of conduct for LPG companies, and also the Consumers Rights Protection Act (CRPA).
Consumer rights activists have been demanding the government to take action against Ghimire under CRPA as it provisions a fine of half a million rupees or imprisonment up to 14 years or both to entrepreneurs who subject consumers to grave risks.
However, instead of implementing Mahara's June 11 decision to scarp SGC's operating license and punishing Ghimire, subsequent Industry Minister Mahendra Paswan in August decided to suspend SGC's license for six months only and let Ghimire walk scot-free on payment of a fine of Rs 500,000. Paswan's decision came just prior to his quitting office.
Minister for Industry Anil Jha has been alleged to have dragged his feet on the matter and tried to save Ghimire.
Local administration had earlier filed a case against Ghimire, charging him with flouting Black Marketeering Act. However, District Administration Office (DAO), Sunsari, released him on a bail of Rs 3.84 million about two-and-a-half months ago.
As Ghimire, who is reported to have close relationship with senior political leaders and senior officials at MoI and Ministry of Commerce and Supplies (MoCS), tried hard to weaken the cases filed against him, Cottage and Small Industry Office (CSIO) in Sunsari has initiated the process to file charges against Ghimire as per the CRPA.
""We forwarded a file in this connection to the District Attorney Office (DAO) last week. We anticipate DA to lodge a case against Ghimire soon,"" said Rama Nath Sharma, chief of CSIO.

"7870",20118225,"Title: India should peacefully compete with China in Indian ocean region_ Robert D Kaplan.rtf; Date: April 7, 2011 Thursday; Text: Robert D Kaplan is simply one of the world's most reputed authorities on geopolitics, defence and foreign policy. As a journalist Kaplan has covered several wars, right from the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s to the fall of the LTTE in Sri Lanka. He shot into international fame as a political analyst following the publication of The Coming Anarchy, which, first published as an article in the Atlantic Monthly in the 1990s, predicted how various factors such as scarcity, crime, overpopulation and disease could rapidly destroy the social fabric of our planet.
Over the years, he has written several books on conflicts around the world-from the Balkans to the badlands of Afghanistan. In his latest book, Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power, Kaplan says that the India Ocean region is crucial in deciding the new balance of power. He suggests that not just India, but the US also peacefully compete with China in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Kaplan, 59, also talks about travel, his next book and more in an interview with Ullekh NP. Edited excerpts:
How tough is it for you to merge your two selves, of being a travel writer and an analyst of geopolitics?
I don't like such distinctions or categories. For the past 30 years as a journalist I've sort of merged travel writing with being an analyst. I think that the perceptions and observations you get travelling through countries can help in analysis. So I don't clearly see a distinction. Remember, travel writing is just a means to explain art, history and politics in a more interesting way for the reader.
How do you collate material?
My last book Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power was a three-year project. I was away from home travelling a total of about nine months a year and the rest was writing. I normally never go away from home for more than a month because I have a family and after a month you have to put all the matter in order, on the page, otherwise you get overwhelmed with all your information... so I need to order my thoughts after about four weeks of travel.
How prone are you to making mistakes?
As I get older I get very nervous about making mistakes. I am always nervous about just getting the wrong point of view or reading the situation wrong ... All you can do is a lot of reading. Travel alone is not enough unless you do a lot of reading in history and politics about the places well. The test of a good piece of travel writing is: is it still relevant years later, in other words five years later, when someone still pick it up?
How do you work towards understanding ground realities in a new place?
I think that understanding ground realities is a matter of not just going to a place and spending time there. It is also a matter of reading not only the history but also philosophy and politics so that you can better understand what is going on, on the ground. When you arrive in a place, the history of that place doesn't begin at that time. It had begun thousands of years before. Unless you have some familiarity with that history, you can't really understand what you're seeing in front of you.
What are the mistakes that the US and countries such as India have made (and are making) in Sri Lanka?
I think that the US at least has not paid sufficient attention to Sri Lanka. This has opened the doors for Chinese strategic influence. Sri Lanka would be very important in the 21st century because it is very close to the main sea lines of communication at a time in history when 90 percent of all commercial goods travel inter-continentally by sea. And the US has ignored it. We pulled out because of human rights violations some years back and this provided an opening for Beijing. I think it is important that not just India, but the United States also peacefully compete with China in places like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Burma (Myanmar).
Why is this happening?
I think the US is preoccupied with problems in Afghanistan and upheavals in the Arab world. The US hasn't paid sufficient attention to what I call the Indo-Pacific region, which is emerging as the economic centre of the world and also an area of military purchases... and it is domestic politics in India that control the country's foreign policy on Sri Lanka.
What exactly is this ""greater Indian Ocean""?
The ""greater Indian Ocean"" stretches from the Red Sea to the South China Sea. And it unites one organic region... you have the Persian Gulf, you have problems in Pakistan and you have India, you also have piracy and other problems in Africa and there is the rising competition between China and the US in the region... The Indian Ocean is on the global centre stage.
What does this mean for India and China?
India and China don't have long-standing ancient hostilities. They were separated by the Himalayas. The rivalry between India and China is recent, and it is brought about by the advancement of military technology... so you have Ch"
"5870",20071937,"Title: DR Congo army clashes with rebels.rtf; Date: January 31, 2007 Wednesday 10:17 PM GMT; Text: Government troops and rebels clashed in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo Wednesday during an operation against a rebel leader, and possible deaths were reported from separate political violence in the southwest.
""There was shooting this morning near Fataki"", about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Bunia, capital of the Ituri region, where regular DRC army troops (FARDC) halted a rebel militia advance on their positions, their commander in Ituri General Vainqueur Mayala told AFP.
""There have been no dead or wounded, according to reports so far,""  he said by phone from Bunia.
The United Nations and the FARDC have jointly launched a ""weaponless district"" operation, announced in January and initiated Tuesday. Mayala said some arms had already been seized by patrols.
The clashes came in an atmosphere of heightened tension in Ituri, where the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) has increased overflights of Karim's bases and is ready to back an offensive by regular forces against the rebel militia.
MONUC's military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Didier Rancher on Wednesday described Karim at a news conference as a ""dinosaur incapable of evolving towards peace"" and condemned his systematic failure to keep his promises.
Since July 2006 Karim, a former member of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) militia, has been promising to demobilise his forces in return for a general amnesty and a colonel's rank in the FARDC, which he has obtained.
He is accused of crimes against civilians and the trafficking of goods to neighbouring Uganda, and is blamed by MONUC for an attack on a UN helicopter which killed a Nepalese peacekeeper in 2005.
He is the last rebel chief resisting a demobilisation process which since the end of 2005 has seen 15,000 combattants lay down arms in the gold-rich Ituri region. Fighting between armed groups and inter-ethnic violence there has taken more than 60,000 lives since 1999, according to humanitarian groups.
""We still hope to persuade Karim through dialogue, but we have already done a lot,"" said Mayala.
Also on Wednesday, witnesses and members of MONUC in the southwestern province of Bas-Congo, said shooting broke out in the evening between police and members of a religious political group called Bundu dia Kongo.
Up to three people may have been killed and several were injured in the clashes, a UN source said on condition of anonymity, but added that the reports of deaths had not been confirmed.
The shooting broke out when police tried to storm the house of the group's spiritual leader Ne Muamba Nswemi in the provincial capital Matadi, the source said.
The situation has been tense in Bas-Congo since an ally of the DRC's President Joseph Kabila was on Saturday elected governor of the province where most people support the opposition. Nsemi ran unsuccessfully for the post.

 Kathmandu, 18 May: Five agitating political parties, whom the king criticized as a harbinger of ""corruption and bad governance"", have decided to chart a new strategy. Still they are waiting for a collective royal audience.
 The agitating parties, which have been waging a continuous disobedience movement for one and a half months, are to hold a meeting soon to discuss the next movement. Amik Sherchan of the People's Front Nepal said that the king's criticism of the political parties has come in a serious manner, and that they will hold a meeting to discuss it.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 19 May 04
Since it has been made public that the king does not favour democracy, the political parties will intensify the movement against monarchy, Nepali Congress leader former deputy prime minister Ram Chandra Poudel said.
 Singling out Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML as the consensus candidate of the five parties, Poudel said: ""The movement will not end until it assumes the power to bring the king to an open field. Now we are ready to confront the palace as well.""
 Addressing a mass gathering after a protest rally in the capital on Tuesday 18 May , Poudel added: ""The king's remarks have shown that he does not need democracy. If the king does not need democracy, we do not need monarchy as well."" Poudel accused the palace of being in search of another ""orderly"" instead of appointing the unanimous candidate proposed by the five political parties.  Note: Political parties have been referring to two prime ministers appointed by the king as ""orderlies""
 Poudel has spoken harshly against the palace after the morning meeting of the Nepali Congress on the king's remarks.  Note: When asked to hand over power to the five agitating parties during a luncheon hosted at Gokarna on 17 May, the king reportedly told the editor of an English magazine that he would do so overnight if the editor wants him to empower leaders who misgovern, and are corrupt.
 ""On moral grounds, we are ready to compare ourselves with the king in an open field,"" Poudel said. ""The king's remark is equivalent to pelting stones from inside a glass house.""
 Bharat Mohan Adhikary, member of the Standing Committee of the CPN-UML, recalled that 12 days have past since the king approved the prime minister's resignation, and still the nation is without a government. Adhikary told Rajdhani newspaper such a remark will only widen the differences between the king and the political parties, and it is detrimental to the king and the institution of monarchy.
 Adhikary expressed resentment at not appointing his party's general secretary, who has been given a clean chit by the Judicial Investigation Commission on Property. ""If the king takes our amicability as our weakness, then we can raise issues against the king. It is in the interest of monarchy to hand over state power to the political parties,"" he said.  passage omitted

It is expected the meeting will be held at 1800 hrs in evening, having been pushed back from 1500 hrs and then again from 1630 hrs. The meeting was stalled even before it began at the Birendra International Convention Center (BICC) in the capital with no headway made on the rights and duties of the president, the 26 CA members to be nominated by the cabinet, among other issues, Kantipur reported. 
The CA, elected through the landmark elections held last month, will formally announce the implementation of the federal democratic republic system in the country, ending the 240-year-old institution of monarchy. Many of the newly elected CA members had reached the CA meeting venue at the BICC. The 601-member CA will write a new constitution for a new Nepal and decide the fate of the last remaining Hindu king of the world. The major constituents of the CA were still holding discussions to reach a common agreement on key issues. The interim legislature parliament has already announced that the country will become a federal democratic republic. As the eldest CA member, Nepali Congress leader KB Gurung will declare the country a republic. Mr Gurung, 73, chaired the CA meeting as Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 84, is still the Chairman of the interim legislature. Yesterday, a total of 568 CA members took the oath of office and secrecy after being elected in the landmark CA polls conducted under First-Past-the-Post and Proportional Representation electoral systems in April. The former rebels CPN-Maoists won 220 seats in the April 10 ballot, Nepali Congress won 110 seats, while the CPN -UML secured 103 and the newly emerged party Madhesi People?(EURO)(TM)s Rights Forum (MPRF), representing Madhes the country?(EURO)(TM)s southern plains along the Indian border, won 52 seats.

"1808",20045074,"Title: Arabs Decry Militants' Demand to French.rtf; Date: August 31, 2004 Tuesday; Text: The militant demand that a French ban on Islamic head scarves be overturned has raised an unprecedented backlash among religious and political leaders in the Middle East, who have often been silent about hostage slayings and other terrorism.
They say those holding two French journalists have desecrated Islam and mindlessly struck out at a country considered a friend to Arabs.
""This is a brutal operation on the human level, a bad one on the Islamic level and a losing one on the political level,"" Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon's most senior Shiite Muslim cleric, told The Associated Press Tuesday.
Instead of attracting supporters, the kidnappings and their link to the head scarf ban ""provokes the ire of Muslim scholars and intellectuals worldwide,"" Fadlallah said.
Such comments contrasted with muted reaction in the region Tuesday when a grisly video surfaced on a militant Muslim Web site showing the purported killing of 12 Nepalese workers kidnapped in Iraq. The group that claimed responsibility had accused the Nepalese of working for the U.S. military. One Iraqi cleric told Al-Arabiya TV that their deaths, while regrettable, were understandable because ""their work is military work.""
Journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot disappeared Aug. 19 on their way from the Iraqi capital to the southern city of Najaf. A group calling itself ""The Islam Army in Iraq"" claims to be holding the two and has demanded France abolish its ban on Muslim head scarves in public schools.
France has said it would press ahead with the law, which goes into effect when school resumes later this week.
A militant group with a similar name to the one claiming to hold the Frenchmen was believed to have killed an Italian freelance journalist last week after Italy's government rejected a demand that it withdraw its 3,000 soldiers in Iraq.
Unlike Italy, France has no troops in Iraq and gained points with Arabs for leading the opposition to last year's U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. There are fewer than 100 French citizens in Iraq, mostly journalists, aid workers and employees of private companies; nearly all are in Baghdad, according to the French government.
In a video broadcast Saturday, the group holding the two reporters gave the French government 48 hours to drop the head scarf ban, then Al-Jazeera reported Monday that the group had extended its deadline by 24 hours. On Tuesday, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said his group had been told the deadline was Wednesday night.
Zaki said the Arab League was ""using whatever moral influence"" it could to get the men freed, but he said the Arab League was not part of any direct negotiations.
Criticism of the kidnapping has come from government officials, activists and religious figures - including those who have censured France for its head scarf ban.
Syria's Grand Mufti Ahmad Kuftaro issued a statement Tuesday calling for the release of the two reporters and also urging France to reconsider its scarf ban - ""because of the sensitivity and importance of this issue for Muslims."" Kuftaro also praised France's stand in support of Arabs. Many Arabs see France as an important ally in the Arab-Palestinian conflict.
Al-Jazeera, the Arab television station, broadcast a stream of criticism from voices including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Lebanon's most senior Shiite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
In a statement issued by the Palestinian news agency WAFA, Arafat urged the journalists' ""immediate release,"" calling France a friend of the Palestinian cause. Egypt's largest Islamic opposition group, the banned Muslim Brotherhood, also condemned the hostage-taking.
Mohammed Bashar al-Faidi, spokesman for Iraq's Muslim Scholars Association, appealed for the Frenchmen's release during a Baghdad news conference Tuesday, saying while the head scarf ban was ""painful for every Muslim,"" threatening French journalists was no way to solve the problem.
Killing the Frenchmen, he added, could lead to Iraq's international isolation.
Dan Bymen, assistant professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, noted that the focus on a French domestic issue was a change in the militant agenda and does not compare with more pressing issues for Muslims, such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or charges the United States has ""crusader"" intentions for the Middle East.
Still, ""it wasn't shocking to me,"" he said. France has long been a target of Muslim militant movements, especially those with links to Algeria. Also, kidnappers may be aiming to send a message to everyone, including countries that do not feel they are a target, that ""any non-Iraqi in the country or anyone working with the Iraqi government is not wanted,"" he said.
""A successful strategy against an occupation is to make it inhospitable to anyone,"" he said.
The abductions have been condemned worldwide, and with denunciations f"

A group of Maoists attacked an army patrol in Bindabasini village in Achham district, 425 kilometers (265 miles) west of Kathmandu, setting off a gunfight, the official told AFP.
""Our information is that at least five Maoists were killed along with a soldier and a policeman. There is a report of heavy casualties on the rebels' side as they were seen carrying away several bodies in bamboo baskets,"" he said.
The army official said rebels and troops also exchanged gunfire Sunday in two other western districts, Parbat and Rolpa, although there was no immediate information on casualties.
He said the Maoists also tried late Saturday to blow up a tower belonging to the state-run Nepal Telecommunications Corporation but were repelled by security forces.
The Maoists broke a seven-month ceasefire on August 27 after the government refused to set up a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The insurgency aimed at overthrowing the monarchy has claimed more than 7,800 lives since 1996, according to official figures.

"6358",20072057,"Title: UN human rights chief to visit Japan 25-26 Jan.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: January 17, 2007 Wednesday
Text of report in English by Japanese news agency Kyodo
Geneva, 17 January: The UN human rights chief will make an official visit to Japan on 25-26 January to enhance Japan's cooperation and financial contribution to the world body, and promote its human rights awareness.
High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour will meet with Foreign Minister Taro Aso and hopes to meet also with Justice Minister Jinen Nagase and representatives of the Diet Members Association for Cooperation with UN Human Rights Activities.
""There is a tendency sometimes internationally to think of Japan as having mainly economic interest and influence. But Japan is an extremely important regional and international presence on a lot of issues,"" Arbour said in an interview with Kyodo News in her office in Geneva.
Evidence can be found in the election of Japan in the newly created UN Human Rights Council, she noted.
""The fact that Japan sought to be elected on the Human Rights Council is a signal of its interest. Its presence on the Council is extremely important"" Arbour said.
However, Japan has recently reduced its contribution to the UN Human Rights Office, a trend Arbour hopes to see reversed. ""Historically Japan has always been an important donor to this office,"" she said. ""It is very important for me to have Japan as one of my main visible contributors, so that it reflects the level of interest and commitment that the Japanese government expresses for human rights issues.""
Arbour, an active opponent to the death penalty, will also seek the views of the government on the issue. The finality of death penalty as a means of justice is ""very troublesome,"" she said.
Arbour voiced her deep concerns and disappointment over the execution of Saddam Hussein and two of his co-accused. ""This precipitous application of the death penalty will have many consequences,"" including depriving the victims of Saddam's other crimes of the possibility to seek justice, she said.
The issue of abductions of Japanese nationals by North Korea will also be discussed, and Arbour expects Japan to swiftly ratify the new International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance adopted by the UN General Assembly at the end of December 2006.
""I certainly hope and count on Japan to be one of the first to ratify the new convention on disappearances. I think there would be expectations that Japan would take interest in that issue,"" she said.
The protection of vulnerable groups such as children, minorities, women and people with disabilities are also high on the agenda of the high commissioner who will seek information about the issue of suicide among school children.
""I will be very interested to hear more about this particular feature. Human rights protection has to be designed first and foremost to protect the most vulnerable. Children certainly fall into that category,"" Arbour said. ""Anything that catches on violence against children or driving children to doing violence to themselves is an extremely important and troubling social issue.""
The high commissioner's visit will follow a mission to Nepal, where her office has established one of its largest field presences in 2005.
""There are a lot of very promising signs that Nepal is pulling itself out of the 11 years of terrible conflict,"" she said. ""I want to make sure that in this transition to a vibrant functioning democratic government Nepal equips itself appropriately with human rights capacity and that it addresses, as it must, the violations of the past.""
Justice and the fight against impunity for crimes committed during the conflict should be an important part of the peace process in Nepal, she said.
The high commissioner is hopeful that the new UN Human Rights Council, created in May 2006 to replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights, will soon equip itself with proper tools to overcome the issue of politicization by equally scrutinizing all countries for their human rights records.
The new procedure of Universal Periodic Review ""should dissipate the claims in the past that some always managed to escape being singled out and others claiming they were unfairly scrutinized every year,"" she said. ""There is no state that has a perfect human rights record.""

At a joint meeting late Wednesday, the parties called for a strike to protest against the media ordinance and call for its immediate withdrawal, Gopal Man Shrestha, acting president of the Nepali Congress (Democratic), said Thursday.
Nepal Sunday banned FM radio stations in Kathmandu from airing news-oriented programmes, a move that followed a media ordinance by King Gyanendra on October 9, which imposed strict controls on ownership and fines and jail for criticism of the royal government.
Gyanendra seized power in February from a four-party coalition government in an effort to stem a Maoist rebellion in the country that has claimed more than 12,000 lives since 1996.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalists has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the ban and the International Press Freedom Mission to Nepal also protested the move.
The alliance of seven political parties, which held daily protests in September against the king's takeover that drew thousands, said it would rally to oppose the news ban and renew the demonstrations suspended for Dussain, a widely observed religious festival that ended October 17.
The alliance urged citizens to gather at Kantipur FM in Kathmandu Thursday  to support their defiance of the ban in the face of a government threat to close the station and seize its equipment on Friday if it fails to stop news broadcasts.
The station, part of Nepal's largest media company Kantipur Publications, has lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court to protest the order.
Other radio journalists have also vowed to defy the ban.
""We will continue with our programme of providing information-oriented bulletins over the FM stations,"" said Ghama Raj Luintel, spokesman of the Save Independent Radio Movement and who airs news programmes over Radio Sagarmatha FM in Kathmandu.

 Kathmandu, 26 November: A so-called battalion commander, a head of a self-styled local government, guerrillas, people's militia and central members of the Maoists have stated that the Maoists do not have the power any more to carry out big strikes nor seize a barracks.  All quoted below . This information was given to the security forces by persons earlier involved with the Maoist terrorist gangs who have now deserted it or have been arrested.
The Rising Nepal, Kathmandu, in English 27 Nov 03 p1
Giving the information that the Maoist guerrillas at present were concentrating on guerrilla warfare, they made it clear that even if they kill one or two soldiers through ambushes and landmines, they will not be able to achieve complete success over the army as a whole.
 Stating that the Maoists were attracting ignorant people towards them by giving cheap slogans and taking advantage of the unemployment, poverty and shortages in the country, they said that political disputes were also one of the reasons for the rise of terrorist activities.
 The arrested activists alleged that the Maoist leaders had taken special facilities, the higher-level commanders were buying land and houses by raising donations, lower level cadres were being exploited and given false assurances, and the brigade had been constituted only to raise the morale of activists. They said that the Maoists were indulging only in terrorist activities. The terrorist leaders are seeking to create rifts and splits, if possible attract the political parties towards them and if it is not, then ensure international support in their favour, it has also been stated.
 Says Laxmi Budhathoki of the so-called people's militia: ""They said that salary will be paid, jobs provided and girls given paternal property and this is the reason for joining them, but nothing happened there. They are eating and staying by force at the people's houses.""
 According to Yadav Bista, a so-called head of the people's government, there is ample possibility of rebellion among the Maoist group and if jobs and law and order are guaranteed, no cadre will stay with them.
 According to Maoist central member Kaji Budha, an old man from Chitwan, Rampur, Maoist leader Prachanda is fed up and extremely worried over the incidents in Nepal and this is the reason why he is smoking excessively and staring at nothing at times. He is worried over how to manage the affairs of the party.
 Budha says ""even if Prachanda wants to proceed with the dialogue, the faction of Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) does not want even to listen to such ideas. It is because of the ultras in the Badal faction that dialogue has not taken place further. A times, both the factions resort to low level allegations against each other.""
 ""I spent the important days of my life uselessly. Because of the internal bickering in the party, the future of any person is not safe in the party,"" said Jaya Bahadur Ghari of the so-called Mangelsen First Battalion. They have called upon all concerned to look for a safe future and not be involved in terrorist activities. Gharti, Bishta, Kaji Budha and Budhathoki have suffered injuries due to explosions of bombs and are undergoing treatment at the Birendra Military Hospital, Chhauni.

 Nepalgunj, 24 June: Rebel Maoists have captured a leased micro-hydro project in Rukum District after its management committee refused to provide them a sum of 100,000 rupees as donation.
 The Bafikot-based Syarpu Daha two-kW micro-hydro project supplies electricity to villages in Shobha, Bafikot and Pokhara village development committees VDC .
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 25 Jun 03Managing director of the project, Prem Prakash Oli, said that the rebels are also collecting electricity tariff from the consumers in the VDCs.

 The project used to collect 52,000 rupees as revenue from its consumers every month. He said that they would not be able to carry out regular maintenance of the project after the rebels resorted to such a tactic.
 Electrification process in other parts of the district has also been suspended due to the Maoist obstruction, he said. Of the total 43 VDCs of the district, only five have access to electricity, as the district has not been connected with the national grid. He said that they would not be able to operate the project in future without adequate security arrangement.

Kathmandu, 17 July: Maoist central committee member Dinanath Sharma has said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala showed a farcical tendency by professing ignorance over Godavari agreement [reached between parties and Maoists on 14 July].
Prime Minister Koirala on Sunday [16 July] had expressed ignorance and surprise over the Godavari agreement. The agreement was reached among the Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Maoists. As per the agreement the three parties had agreed to dissolve the parliament and set up an ""interim parliament"".
""We could not understand what the prime minister was trying to say,"" Sharma said speaking at the Reporters' Club in Kathmandu on Monday. ""He should not show such farcical tendency,"" he said. Sharma also said the Maoists will not lay down arms until the announcement of an end to monarchy through an interim constitution.
Sharma, who is also a member of the Maoist talks team, sad the rebels were ready to manage their arms if the political problem was resolved. ""But the Maoists will not surrender,"" he said.
Sharma stressed the need for the seven parties to create an environment of trust to bring about change.

 The fourth phase of anti-king protests against for perceived regressive measures since 4 October last year will be announced by five opposition parties Monday 2 June afternoon, CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) leader Bharat Mohan Adhikari said Sunday.
 King Gyanendra's call to seven parties, including four opposition parties, to submit a common candidate in 72 hours to succeed Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand lapses Monday night.
 Amid a stalemate between the Palace and the opposition, the five opposition parties have agreed to sponsor CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Nepal to succeed Chand.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 2 Jun 03
The king has not given any indication that he will accept the recommendation despite threats of heightened protests if he rejects the opposition suggestion. Three other parties in the dissolved parliament have also staked claims to form a new government.
 Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP) says an indigenous resident of the Terai has never been a prime minister while the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party argues it is the rightful heir of the Chand government because of the reconciliation efforts it has made to end a political stalemate.
 Despite opposition claims that protests have percolated down to villages, the people, it appears, generally are unconcerned, prompting the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to issue party directives of punitive action against reluctant activists who stay away from protests.
 The three-week planned phased protests ended Saturday with burning of effigies depicting regression. The CPN-UML chief, Madhav Nepal, led a party demonstration independently of other opposition parties in Kathmandu, Sunday, protesting ""regression"" ahead of the announcement of further joint protests Monday.
 A central committee meeting of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) Sunday appealed for ""an understanding"" between all seven parties of the dissolved parliament to present a common candidate to the king, Monday, party spokesman Hom Nath Dahal said.
 ""We appeal for national interest and on the basis of universally accepted democratic norms,"" the party said in a statement after a committee meeting. The meeting, chaired by party President Sher Bahadur Deuba, accused five opposition parties of a ""dual character"".
 ""The four parties at the royal audience did not speak a word when the king asked for a common prime ministerial candidate at the meeting Friday. Now they say the king should only appoint a nominee of five parties,"" Dahal told Nepalnews.
 Rebel NSP that has joined the protests, was not invited to Friday's meet.

Previously visa fees ranged from 30 dollars for a one-time visit to 80 dollars for multiple trips within the year to the land of Mount Everest.
The visa waiver applies to Chinese and citizens of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which besides Nepal includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
""The visa fee for visitors from the SAARC region and China has been waived to develop Nepal as a regional tourist hub,"" Finance Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani told reporters.
Indians, who make up more visitors to Nepal than any other nationality, until now required visas only if arriving by air, with those crossing by land needing only to present identification.
The new visa rules were enacted in the annual budget which went into effect Thursday. Lohani said the budget included 20 million dollars to provide loans to ailing industries, including tourism.
The tourism industry in Nepal was devastated after an upsurge in 2001 of a Maoist insurgency aimed at overthrowing the constitutional monarchy.
But the rebels and the government reached a ceasefire January 29, and in the first half of this year visitors' arrivals were up about 40 percent, according to tourism ministry officials.
Foreigners' arrivals had reached a peak in Nepal in 1999 at around 500,000 people, but dropped to around 271,000 in 2002.
Nepal heavily promoted tourism this year for celebrations of the 50th anniversary on May 29 of Everest's conquest by Sir Edmund Hillary and the late Sherpa Norgay Tenzing.

The prime minister-headed committee on Sunday discussed these issues but failed to reach any conclusion, said Chief Secretary Madhav Prasad Ghimire, committee spokesperson, after the meeting.
A Special Committee source told Republica that the top leaders of major political parties are meeting on Monday to discuss integration modality and number of the Maoist army personnel to be considered for integration. These issues are the most contentious ones with regard to the management of over 19,000 Maoist combatants.
""It is positive that the Special Committee has begun discussion on the crux of the peace process,"" said JP Gupta, a member of the Special Committee. He said that the prime minister told the meeting that he would hold consultations with the leadership of other parties on the issues.
The Special Committee has decided to finalize the integration modality, number of the ex-combatants to be integrated, rehabilitation package, standard norms for integration and rank harmonization by June 19.
Though the parties are yet to reach consensus on the integration modality, the UCPN (M) has already decided to partially accept a Nepal Army-proposed integration modality.
The army-floated modality has proposed integration of Maoist combatants by creating a separate directorate that will have personnel from the army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and the Maoist army. But the Maoists are yet to accept individual integration of the combatants and the mandate of the directorate, among others, as proposed by the NA.
Even the ruling CPN-UML has accepted the army's modality. But the main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) has not made its stance on the army's modality clear. However, NC leaders have publicly said that they might accept the army-proposed modality if the Maoists accept it in entirety.
Similarly, the major parties also differ on the number of the ex-combatants to be integrated. The ruling UCPN (M) has said that some 8,000 to 10,000 ex-combatants should be integrated while another ruling party, CPN (UML) has said that the number should be 5,000. But the NC has said that only 4,000 combatants should be considered for integration. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

"4631",20065585,"Title: Nepal imposes curfew to thwart anti-royal protests.rtf; Date: April 8, 2006 Saturday 5:18 AM GMT; Text: Nepal's government imposed a daytime curfew in the capital and cut mobile telephone services Saturday in an effort to thwart anti-royal protests called for later in the day.
Hundreds of armed soldiers and police patrolled the deserted streets of Kathmandu.
Authorities cut mobile telephones early Saturday and called the curfew from 10:00 am until 9:00 pm (0415 GMT-1515 GMT) in Kathmandu and neighbouring Patan, Nepal Television reported.
Opposition parties with the support of Maoist rebels have called for a mass protest against King Gyanendra's absolute rule but a government crackdown has seen hundreds of activists arrested.
The international community has denounced the crackdown, with the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, India and Japan all calling for an end to the arrests and the release of those detained.
A protest leader told AFP that supporters would break the curfew.
""We will go ahead with our protest despite the curfew,"" said Kashinath Adhikari, from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist).
A similar demonstration was thwarted in January when the government rounded up hundreds of activists, banned protests, cut mobile telephone services and imposed curfews.
Saturday is the third day of a four-day anti-royal general strike called by the opposition parties.
The first two days saw Nepal come to a virtual standstill with very little traffic on highways and businesses across the country closed.
This week, the royal government imposed a night-time curfew, arrested political leaders, banned protests and arrested hundreds for defying the ban.
Home Minister Kamal Thapa said Friday that 751 people had been arrested since Monday, and that the government was prepared to tackle the protests by imposing curfews or declaring a state of emergency.
""The government has proper security arrangements in place,"" Thapa told journalists.
Sidelined opposition parties have called for a mass protest Saturday and have the support of the Maoists who formed a loose alliance with political leaders last November to restore democracy in the Himalayan kingdom.
King Gyanendra took over in February 2005, saying the politicians had failed to tackle a Maoist insurgency which has raged since 1996 and left around 12,500 people dead.
Saturday marks the 16th anniversary of Nepal's ""people's movement day"".
On April 8, 1990, late King Birendra lifted a ban on political parties which eventually led the following year to the formation of the first elected government in nearly 50 years.

"6634",2008954,"Title: Newly republican Nepal hopes for peace dividend.rtf; Date: June 1, 2008 Sunday 1:27 AM GMT; Text: As Nepal made an historic leap this week, ousting its Hindu god-king by voting to become a republic, many were hoping a period of peace and stability would boost economic growth in the impoverished nation.
Nowhere are hopes higher perhaps than in the Maoist heartland of Rolpa, where the former rebels launched an armed struggle in 1996 that was key in paving the way to Nepal's transformation to a republic.
""The 10 years of war were hardest for us villagers. We now have peace. I am very happy about that,"" said Kumari Jargha Magar, 28, a housewife from the hilly district 280 kilometres (174 miles) west of capital Kathmandu.
""Without peace, we cannot think about good education, health services, roads, electricity or employment.""
Magar walked for three days to reach Rolpa village, where Maoists last month promoted a ""tourism festival"" that thousands of people attended.
The event appeared to be a bid to buoy local spirits as well as to show that the former rebels, who stunned the nation by winning key polls last month to a body charged with writing a new constitution, are serious about development.
The ultra-leftists hold over a third of the seats in the 601-member assembly, which abolished the monarchy as its first act on Wednesday and gave unpopular King Gyanendra a two-week deadline to leave his pink-hued palace.
The Maoists are in negotiations with rival parties to lead the next government, which will replace a power-sharing administration that has governed for two years.
Their leader, Prachanda, has promised double-digit growth in the aid and remittance-dependent country, where growth stands at 3.5 percent and average annual incomes are about 350 dollars.
""Our party is planning for an economic revolution,"" said Muldhan Roka, 35, head of the Rolpa branch of the Young Communist League. ""I think our party can lead this country to the next level within five years.""
That will be difficult in a country where villages have electricity poles that have never supplied a single watt of power and wells that are dry of clean drinking water.
Villages may have schools but no textbooks -- a shortage that recently forced a two-week shutdown in learning centres around the country.
The capital -- the richest place in Nepal -- turns dark at night because street lights don't work, and posh hotels post timetables of power cuts.
In Rolpa, locals said they were discriminated against by authorities and troops -- leaving little room for development.
""There were no basic necessities and the security people would not let us bring those things to the villages because we were the ones that started 'the People's War,'"" said Magar, who believes things will be different now.
The bloody civil war -- in which at least 13,000 people were killed and Nepal's development stalled for a decade -- ended with a peace deal between mainstream political parties and the Maoists in 2006.
The deal sidelined the king, who alienated the country with a power grab in 2005 that saw him dismiss the government and rule directly before mass protests forced him to cede control 14 months later.
The Maoists have defended their decade-long bloody struggle, saying it was necessary to do away with feudalism and end discrimination against minorities and low-caste Hindu groups.
Despite their pledge to embrace multiparty democracy, the Maoists face criticism for their human rights record, most recently with the abduction and murder of a Kathmandu businessman.
There are also allegations that the former rebels are making it hard to do business by continuing to engage in extortion.
""We have huge challenges ahead,"" said Kalpana Roka, 23, a former Maoist platoon commander on leave from one of the UN-monitored camps where she and some 20,000 registered Maoist combatants live as part of the peace deal.
""There is a big difference between being a rebel and being a statesman. Insurgency is different than policy making. We have to think about the country now.""
Some of the country's poorest said they hope the Maoists will do that.
""My life has been earned on the weighing scales,"" said Abdul Rahman, 61, who eeks out a living selling dried fish. ""I don't have any land, nor do I have any savings. The government and other parties have not done anything for us.""
""I gave the Maoists a chance this time. Let's see what they can do as all the other parties have had their turn.""

 Kathmandu, 11 September: Acting Royal Nepalese Ambassador to Egypt Dhan Bahadur Oli reached Beirut (Lebanon) on Saturday 11 September to make arrangements for the return of the stranded Iraq-bound Nepali workers to Nepal.
 Talking to the Post over telephone from Beirut, Oli said that the stranded Nepalis will be sent back to Nepal at any cost. ""Whatever unpleasant that had to happen has already happened. It won't repeat again,"" he said.
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 12 Sep 04
Oli was hinting at the dismal plight of Nepali workers bound for war-ravaged Iraq in the wake of the 12 Nepali hostages murdered by Iraqi insurgents. Many of such workers have re-routed to Lebanon in a bid to return safely to Nepal.
 Ananta Khadka, a Nepali who has been in Lebanon for seven years, said that at least 19 Iraq-bound Nepalis who entered Lebanon illegally have come into contact with the Nepali community. He added that air tickets for the stranded have already been booked by the latter in coordination with the Royal Nepalese embassy, Egypt, which also looks after Nepali interests in Lebanon.
 Khadka said 11 Nepalis were recently ""rescued"" from the clutches of Balwant Singh, an Indian agent who had brought them to Lebanon to send them to Iraq. ""We are also trying to trace other Nepalis who might have entered Lebanon illegally but are now stranded.""
 Ambassador Oli said he has already communicated with the Lebanese government with regard to the plight of the Nepalis. He, however, declined to divulge the details. Khadka did say that there still are five persons in the ""clutches"" of another Indian, Kishor Singh, who earlier had claimed that he had merely provided shelter to the Nepalis on ""humanitarian grounds"".
 ""Kishor Singh is one of the agents who supplies Nepali workers illegally,"" Khadka claimed. However, Kishor told the Post that he has sent the ""missing five"" to work to support their lives.
 ""If Kishor doesn't return the five Nepalis to us by tomorrow, the Lebanese government has already agreed to conduct a raid on his house,"" said Khadka.  passage omitted
 The Nepalese embassy in Egypt, in coordination with the Lebanon-based Nepali community, sent three illegal Nepali immigrants home last week.

"4472",20061870,"Title: Nepal 's rebels, government set to sign peace accord.rtf; Date: November 21, 2006 Tuesday 11:56 AM GMT; Text: A landmark peace deal to end a decade of bloody insurgency in Nepal will be signed Tuesday night, a government negotiator said, despite last-minute wrangling over the accord.
""The signing ceremony will be held at Birenrda International Convention Centre Tuesday evening,"" Arjun Narsingh, a delegate from the Nepali Congress Party, told AFP.
The draft agreement was struck on November 8 and had been due to be signed last week. A Tuesday deadline was then set. Under the deal, the rebels are to end their ""people's war"", join an interim government and place their arms and troops under UN monitoring.
The 90,000-strong Nepal Army was also supposed to be confined to quarters by Tuesday.
""It's unlikely that we will meet this deadline, because the United Nations is unlikely to deploy its personnel for verification of the People's Liberation Army weapons and personnel by Tuesday,"" rebel negotiator Dev Gurung explained.
He did, however, stress that ""our PLA (People's Liberation Army) comrades have already gathered in the seven areas where they will be confined"".
The personal representative sent by UN chief Kofi Annan said last week that the world body was waiting for the peace agreement to be signed before it could begin its monitoring mission.
Once deadly foes, the government and Maoist rebels have observed a ceasefire for more than six months, after they cooperated in April to organise mass protests that forced King Gyanendra to restore parliament and end direct rule.
The peace deal leaves the king facing an uncertain future, with the fiercely republican rebels vowing they will not rest until Nepal's almost 240-year-old monarchy is abolished.
Some of the parties in the coalition favour a ceremonial role for the king, who is revered by many as a Hindu deity.
But on Monday an official panel called for Gyanendra to be punished for ordering a deadly crackdown by security forces during April's protests.
The rebels say they are undergoing a major political makeover, but are also under pressure to put an end to activities including alleged forced recruitment.
On Monday the United States, which continues to class the Maoists as a terrorist organisation, denounced what it said was ""the continued forced recruitment of Nepalis, including children"".
A top rebel denied the charge.
""We have not recruited children in our People's Liberation Army, but summoned all our party cadres who had gone to their homes after the ceasefire,"" said Dina Nath Sharma, a rebel peace negotiator.
Nepal's civil war has claimed at least 12,500 lives since 1996.
This is the third time that the rebels and government have tried to hammer out a peace deal in the impoverished Himalayan nation. Two previous attempts in 2001 and 2003 failed, plunging the country back into conflict.

"4761",20061725,"Title: Cigarette museum proves unlikely Indonesian tourism attraction.rtf; Date: January 5, 2006 Thursday 11:48 AM GMT; Text: The sweet, pungent scent of cloves and tobacco hangs heavy in the air as women paste, roll and snip cigarettes, their fingers flying faster than the eye can follow as tourists observe the public face of one of Indonesia's most successful companies.
Staring down the global trend towards demonising tobacco, Sampoerna, which was snapped up by US giant Philip Morris in March for 5.2 billion dollars, proudly showcases itself at this gleaming museum in Indonesia's second city, Surabaya.
Pegged on the rags-to-riches tale of its founder, Chinese immigrant Liem Seeng Tee, House of Sampoerna claims it is highlighting a great Indonesian story rather than glorifying smoking to the 5,000 visitors coming here each month.
""We got so many requests from university students and others to visit our factory that we could not accommodate all of them, so we built this museum,"" says marketing manager Hengki Setiawan.
Using the former premises of a Dutch-era orphanage that the company bought in 1932, it opened two years ago.
""We want to share with the public the history of Sampoerna, the struggle of the owner and family to make Sampoerna a success,"" Hengki says.
Students crouch to earnestly scrawl notes at a replica of the first handcart opened by Liem, and stroll by the framed black-and-white photographs of the business in its early years, speaking in library-hushed tones.
A fountain gurgles in the foyer, muffled by heavy red ceiling-to-floor drapes and surrounded by tasteful Chinese furniture.
Four generations on from Liem, the company has diversified into numerous industries -- but the focus here is firmly on the cigarettes.
Cabinets display everything from old printing plates for cigarette packs to a book titled ""Smoking is Good For You"": a title perhaps meant to provide solace to the millions of smokers in the world's fifth largest tobacco market.
According to a 2004 Ministry of Health report, 62.2 percent of Indonesian men smoked in 2001, compared to 1.3 percent of women. More than two-thirds started before they turned 19.
Most popular are kretek, produced from a blend of tobacco and cloves and named for the sound they make when a smoker inhales on them. Liem started pre-rolling them in 1934 to produce Dji Sam Soe, still one of the country's leading brands.
Upstairs in a display room, with a view over a factory floor where hundreds of women churn out hand-rolled cigarettes, a half-dozen workers show up close how it is done. One picks up 50 sticks in her hand without needing to count.
If a worker rolls 4,000 cigarettes per day, she earns 60,000 rupiah (about 60 dollars) per week. Sampoerna has a workforce of more than 37,000 and the company booked revenue of almost 1.0 billion dollars in 2004.
""We are here to look around and learn about the management of Sampoerna, its history,"" says Ayu Setiarimi, one of four tourism students from Airlangga University.
""Indirectly it's promoting Sampoerna, but in another way our knowledge is now wider about cigarettes and how Sampoerna has grown.""
None of the four women smoke.
""In Indonesia, if men see women smoke they will think that maybe that's not a good woman smoking,"" Setiarini says. ""The perception among Indonesians, especially guys, is like that.""
Indonesia and Nepal are the only two countries in Asia that have not signed on to the UN's 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which among a slew of other measures, requires signatories to impose restrictions on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion when it comes into force.
""If they put their logo there, it means promotion,"" Hakim Sorimuda Pohan, an MP working on tobacco control, says of the museum, which he has not visited.
He tells AFP he believes it would not be allowed if Indonesia signed on to the convention -- but fears are rife that employment would drop off as a result, so he says it is unlikely to be signed anytime soon.
Museum general manager Ina Silas says that no complaints from anti-smokers or health authorities have so far been received.
""We have to prevent this, so that's why we have policies about people being of a certain age,"" she says. Visitors aged under 18 must be accompanied by their parents.
A swish cafe where company logos are prominently displayed and an art gallery with changing exhibitions are other drawcards the company hopes will lure visitors, who do not pay for admission.
Sampoerna bought the premises in 1932, turning it first of all into a theatre visited by Charlie Chaplin the same year. Founding Indonesian president Sukarno also used it to make a series of speeches in 1938.
""This has really become one of the tourist destinations -- in Surabaya, there are not so many places to visit,"" marketing manager Hengki concedes. 
""We want House of Sampoerna to become the new icon of Surabaya ... The kretek is very Indonesian.""

The closure of Unilever Nepal in Hetaunda, 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of the capital Kathmandu, was the latest blow to impoverished Nepal's economy, reeling from a Maoist revolt which has claimed over 12,000 lives since 1996.
The closure came after the All Nepal Trade Union warned Unilever Nepal in a letter that if it failed to meet a 15-point set of demands by August 16 ""the factory would not be permitted to operate and further actions would be taken,"" a company statement said.
The letter did not specify what steps might be taken. But companies which ignore Maoist demands are often torched or bombed by rebels and their employees warned they face physical harm if they report for work, police say.
Unilever Nepal, employing around 2,000 workers directly and indirectly, is 80 percent owned by Hindustan Lever Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever Plc, a senior company official said.
""We've closed the factory as the 15-point union demand can't be met,"" Ravi Bhakta Shrestha, a director of Unilever Nepal, told AFP. The demands by the union included a call for higher wages, he said.
There was no comment from the union or the Maoists on the decision to shut  the company which produced cosmetics and toiletries and had annual sales of 1.5 billion rupees (21.35 million) dollars.
Last year, Unilever Nepal said suspected rebels caused major damage when they bombed the factory in what it described as an unprovoked attack.
Meanwhile, in another setback for the economy of Nepal where King Gyanendra seized power in February saying he wanted to crush the insurgency, an army official said suspected rebels torched a major spinning mill.
There were no injuries in the fire late Wednesday at Jyoti Spinning Mills  which belonged to Padma Jyoti, a top industrialist and brother of assistant finance minister Roop Jyoti, said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
The plant was in Parwanipur, 256 kilometres (160 miles) south of Kathmandu.
""A group of terrorists entered the plant and torched the factory's machine building containing cotton rolls, clothes and other goods,"" causing damage estimated at 200 million rupees, the army official said.
There was no statement on the attack from the rebels who are fighting to replace the Himalayan nation's monarchy with a communist republic.

Mohan Baidya, 52, a member of the banned Nepal Communist Party (Maoist), and his colleague, Indian national Narayan Vikram Pradhan, were arrested in Siliguri in West Bengal state on Monday evening.
Siliguri is about an hour's drive from the southwestern Nepalese border town of Kakarbhitta.

Mishra said at least six Maoist leaders have been arrested in the district during the past 18 months.
After the arrests, police raided some hideouts of suspected Maoist rebels in Siliguri and its outskirts and seized Maoist literature, leaflets, cell phones and other documents.
""We fear that more rebels have taken shelter in Siliguri and the hills of Darjeeling. The raids will continue,"" he said.
Mishra said Nepal has not yet formally asked for extradition of the two men but the pair will be handed over to the Nepalese government if such a request was received.
Baidya is the most senior Maoist leader arrested since the Maoist insurgency began in 1996.
Earlier, another Maoist party politburo member C.P. Gajurel was arrested in India last year while trying to travel to Europe with a fake passport.
Analysts in Kathmandu said with Baidya's arrest, the Maoists, who scuttled a third round of peace talks with the government last August to resume, will be inclined to resume negotiations.
The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has so far claimed more than 9,500 lives.

"1254",2003659,"Title: Nepal Maoist leader seen _exuding confidence_.rtf; Date: March 31, 2003, Monday; Text: Text of report by Nepalese newspaper Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site on 31 March
 Kathmandu, Sunday 30 March: Sitting quietly on a chair inside a posh Kathmandu hotel, his hands fiddling with the microphone, his piercing eyes surveying the scene before him, Dr Baburam Bhattarai cut an impressive if unlikely figure.
 Leader of the Maoist negotiating team, he is also a feared rebel leader, one of their main ideologues and a man who, along with topmost rebel leader Prachanda, has gained near-mythological status since the Maoists launched their violent ""People's War"" campaign seven years ago.
 But here in Kathmandu, a day after emerging publicly for the first time in seven years, it was difficult to imagine that this was the same person whose calls to arms for political change had affected the lives of thousands of people and caused so much turmoil in the country.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 31 Mar 03
Exuding confidence and even exhibiting a slight touch of humour, Dr Bhattarai on Sunday appeared before the foreign and domestic press to once again explain the Maoists' goals. His intense personality would have made it easy to overlook the presence of other Maoist luminaries had they not been as important a player in the movement as he is. Flanking Dr Bhattarai were the Maoists' top military brains, Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) and Dev Gurung, as well as political leaders Matrika Prasad Yadav and Krishna Bahadur Mahara. But the forum clearly belonged to the bearded architect-turned-revolutionary.
 Speaking in measured tones rather than the staccato bursts which characterized his first press conference yesterday, the immaculately dressed Dr Bhattarai lost no time in getting over with the niceties and into the heart of the matter.
 The Maoists would like all the political parties which believe in parliamentary democracy to be included in the peace negotiations, he said. The reality of the country demands that. According to Dr Bhattarai, there exists two states with two armies within the country but three major political forces which are operational - the monarchical force, the Maoists and the political parties which believe in parliamentary democracy.
 ""There will be no political solution if one of the forces is left out. So we will try our utmost to get the political parties involved,"" said Dr Bhattarai, adding that the Maoists had enough patience and would work to get the political parties to come onboard. But he also spelt out where the Maoists differed with the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist) .
 Referring to demands by the political parties to either revive the dissolved House of Representatives or form an all-party government under the present constitution, Dr Bhattarai said: ""The reality is that the old constitution is dead. They (political parties) say, restore it. But how can you restore it? This is what they don't understand. They must come forward to build a new constitution.""
 And how do you draw a new constitution? The rebel leader explained that the first step would be to start the official peace negotiations, followed by a round-table conference of all political parties and movements which would then form an all-party government with the mandate to hold elections to a constituent assembly.
 ""Constitutional assembly is a means, not the end. We want to create a political system where all forces and movements are represented. The new political system we envision will go beyond the present multi-party system. We are absolutely clear that there will be no return to the status quo or to the situation that prevailed before 1990 People's Movement,"" he said.
 He added that the Maoists also favoured the re-drawing of electoral constituencies so as to give adequate representation to all peoples. And he even indicated that there could be a proportional electoral system rather than the first-past-the-post system in place now. But what if the elected constituent assembly fails to include the Maoists' ideals in the new constitution? ""If the election is freely held, then naturally we will abide by it,"" he said.
 Asked to explain if republican ideals remained the Maoists' ultimate goal, Dr Bhattarai said that though republican communism remained the party's long-term goal, the Maoists are ready to compromise. ""That is our long-term goal. But as far as present balance of political forces is concerned, there may be some give and take. We don't know right now what that will be...We want to explore it further…  ellipsis as published It is a reality that the monarchy is a political force at present.""
 The Maoist leader then urged the monarch to make some sacrifices. ""The king should make some sacrifices. Then his name can be written in history in golden letters. Unless he makes the necessary sacrifices, it will be difficult for him to maintain control,"" Dr Bhattarai said. Pressed to explain what such sacrifices might be, Dr Bhatta"

 Nepalgunj, 16 June: Maoists have put pressure on teachers in areas under their control in Jumla mid west Nepal to wear combat dress while teaching.
 After the Maoists issued orders for teachers in Jumla district midwest Nepal to wear combat dress compulsorily by 14 June, give all their salary for the party and attend all party activities, the number of teachers fleeing to district headquarters Khalanga has escalated.
Spacetime, Kathmandu, in Nepali 17 Jun 04 p3
In recent days, the Maoists have even started delegating military responsibility to teachers saying it was the party policy.
 According to one teacher who is seeking shelter in the district headquarters said the Maoists had announced that they were deputing secondary level teachers as brigade commanders, lower secondary level teachers as battalion commanders and primary level teachers as platoon commanders.
 A member of the National Human Rights Commission Sushil Pyakurel, who returned to Nepalgunj south midwest Nepal after touring the area, said the Maoists were putting the lives of teachers at risk by involving them in military activities. According to him, nearly 300 teachers working in rural areas of Jumla had fled to district headquarters.
 ""By involving teachers in military activities, the Maoists have violated humanitarian law and international norms of human rights."" passage omitted

    At the Busan Declaration on Transport Development in Asia and  the Pacific, the ministers vowed to improve competitiveness of  exports and reduce cost of imports to set up an efficient,  reliable and cost-effective transport services, including  infrastructure, facilitation and logistics to support continued  growth in the region.
    The declaration stressed the important role of ""dry ports"" in  the development of an international integrated intermodal system  and their potential to become centers for economic development,  particularly in landlocked countries and wider domestic  hinterlands.
    It also hailed the intergovernmental agreements on the Asian  Highway and Trans-Asian Railway networks, which are regarded as  the major building blocks in the development of an international  integrated intermodal transport system.
    In Asia, about half million people were killed while another 2  million people were injured in road accidents every year,  accounting for some 66 percent of the casualties caused by road  accidents worldwide. The transport ministers of UNESCAP members  discussed the issues of road safety and adopted the Ministeral  Declaration on Improving Road Safety in Asia and the Pacific on  Saturday.
    In the document, the ministers called for more measures to  improve road safety in the region, including making road safety a  policy priority, more protection for vulnerable road users, strict regulation on vehicles, effective education on road safety  awareness and international cooperation.
    Following the adoption of the two declarations, the 2006  UNESCAP Ministerial Conference on Transport closed its curtain in  Busan, southeastern port city of South Korea.
    Officials of UNESCAP member states attended the preliminary  meeting, the International Transport and Logistics Fair 2006, the  Asia-Pacific Business Forum 2006 and the Ministerial Conference on Transport 2006 from Monday to Saturday.
    On Friday, transport ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, South  Korea, Russia, Sri Lanka, Tajikstan, Thailand, Turkey, Uzbekistan  and Vietnam signed on the Trans-Asian Railway Network Agreement ( TAR paving the way for further connection of the 81,000-km trans- continental railway network in Asia.
    The TAR, together with the Asian Highway Network under UNESCAP  auspices that took effect in July 2005, is regarded as a major  breakthrough in accelerating the establishment of an international transport system in the Asia-Pacific region.

An announcement on state-run Radio Nepal said the curfew would be imposed in the city of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu.
The order to stay off the streets was imposed after police on Tuesday fired rubber bullets and tear gas at thousands of protesters calling for King Gyanendra's ouster in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations in Pokhara.
At least a dozen people were injured, according to doctors at the Gandaki Hospital.
Radio Nepal said anyone violating the curfew would be shot. Soldiers have killed one protester in Pokhara in the past two weeks of continuous protests against the king, who seized power last year after sacking the elected government.

Benipur, by the way, is not in Uttar Pradesh. It's in southern Nepal, close to the Indian state. If Mayawati and Mulayam extended their election battle beyond the border, each would happily find many voters.

Southern Nepal, comprising the Terai region, has many families with names like Shukla, Yadav and Vishwakarma. And they don't want a fence on the border - a suggestion to tighten security. The border divides many families, including Nandlal's. He goes back and forth every day.
  ""My father Om Prakash lives in Nautanva, India. I live in Bhairwan, Nepal. Whenever the two governments impose restrictions on our movement, I would feel I am in jail,"" he says. The border is defined in urban areas but in villages, the No Man's Land is hard to spot.Like their love for all matters Indian, the Terai people love Tendulkar. ""Whenever Sachin does badly, we don't eat for a day,"" says Nidhi Lal, who has written a Bhojpuri song on the ongoing Madhesi movement that seeks a separate state.
  ""I have a home here and I have a home in Kanpur, too. We took Nepal citizenship to retain our business and we have Indian citizenship also,"" said Pradip Shukla of Jamuna village in Nepalganj. The Shuklas also vote in on both sides of the border. And if votes cross the border, so do love and marriage.
  Harvinder and his twin brother own a shop in Sunauli, which is on the Indian side.

""We bought a house in Bhutval, 25 km inside the Nepal border and visited them every weekend,"" said Harvinder.""This continued for eight years. We had children."" Now, the family has moved here. In Bulhariya village on the Indian side, there is a madrasa and a school nearby. It gets students from both sides.

"6429",2007540,"Title: Int'l community condemns murder of Bhutto, calls for calm in Pakistan.rtf; Date: December 28, 2007 Friday 1:15 AM EST; Text: The international community on  Thursday condemned the assassination of Pakistan's opposition  leader and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and called for  calm and restraint in Pakistan.
    Bhutto, 54, was killed Thursday evening in a suicide bombing  attack during her election rally at the Liaquat Bagh park in  Rawalpindi, some 30 km south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad.  At least 20 people were killed in the attack.
    The UN Security Council strongly condemned the assassination.  The Council held an emergency meeting and issued a statement  condemning the terrorist attack ""in the strongest terms.""
    It also called on all Pakistanis to exercise restraint and  maintain stability in the country.
    UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice as soon as possible.
    U.S. President George W. Bush, strongly condemning the murder,  telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf to discuss  the situation the wake of the assassination.
    U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Amin Fahimm,  the new leader of Bhutto's political party, to voice U. S. support for Pakistan's upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Jan. 8.
    White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said: ""We would urge calm  and hope that all the Pakistanis would mourn her death, celebrate  her life and unite together.""
    Unrest broke out in several areas of Pakistan and at least two  people were killed in violence stirred up by Bhutto's  assassination.
    Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message of  condolences to Musharraf, expressing the hope that those  responsible for Bhutto's death would be found and punished.
    ""We hope the masterminds of that crime will be found and will  face deserved punishment,"" Putin said.
    The Russian Foreign Ministry urged ""all responsible forces in  Pakistan"" to ""show maximum self-control,"" and to ignore extremist  provocations.
    British Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the murder and  said it was ""a sad day"" for political freedom and democracy.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted with ""shock"" to the  killing, saying the ""cowardly act"" underscored the need to  continue the fight against terrorism and support those who  suffered its consequences.
    Canadian Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said: ""I urge the  government and people of Pakistan to continue to reject all forms  of violence and to resist those who seek to destabilize their  country.""
    Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said: ""The sacrifice of  ex-premier Bhutto must be the strongest example for those who  won't give in to terrorism.""
    Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa strongly condemned the killing of Bhutto and expressed shock at such ""heinous terrorist  crime.""
    Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit also condemned the  bomb attack against Bhutto, saying it was important for the  Pakistani factions to stand side by side against radicalism and  terrorism.
    Jordan's King Abdullah II expressed Jordan's support for  Pakistan to overcome the consequences of the incident.
    The Turkish Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the  assassination and hoped those who committed this crime would be  brought to justice.
    Iran also voiced its strong condemnation, saying the ""terrorist and criminal act"" was aimed at disrupting calm in neighboring  countries and the whole Muslim world.
    Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the  killing and expressed deep condolences to Bhutto's family and the  whole Pakistan.
    In Africa, the South African government appealed to all  political parties in Pakistan and the Pakistani people to remain  calm during this very turbulent period in its history.
    Nigeria's Senate President David Mark condemned the  assassination and said it was an unexpected action in a democratic setting.
    The governments of many other countries including Albania,  Greece, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, the Czech  Republic, Nepal, Singapore, Israel and Syria also expressed their  condemnation of the murder.
    Thursday's suicide attack was the second one against Bhutto  since she returned home in October from eight years in exile. The  first struck a welcome-home rally in Karachi, the biggest  Pakistani city, just after her return, killing 139 people.
    Bhutto was sworn in as prime minister of Pakistan in December  1988, becoming the first woman to head that country. But her  government was dismissed in 1990 amid corruption allegations.  Bhutto's father, also a prime minister, was hanged by the military in 1979.
    Re-elected in 1993, she was thrown out again three years later  on further graft charges. She went into exile in April 1999.

 Eighteen police officers and 11 army soldiers were killed in the attack in Bhojpur, about 200 kilometers east of the capital, and over a dozen other security personnel were injured.
The rebels also suffered heavy losses when a night-vision helicopter pounded them in the fighting, according to the army. Dozens of rebels were killed and at least 10 bodies of the insurgents have been recovered so far, the army said.
 Hundreds of rebels launched the attack in the center of the town by hurling bombs and opening fire at government office buildings around 9:30 p.m. Fighting lasted until the early hours of Wednesday.
 The office of the local chief government official, a local bank building and a telecom tower were destroyed.
 The rebels killed most of the security personnel guarding the telecom tower.
 The injured security personnel were airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment, the government said, adding further details of the losses were not immediately known.
 The attack in Bhojpur is the largest carried out by the rebels since the breakdown of a cease-fire and peace talks with the government last August.
 The rebels of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) are waging an armed rebellion to topple the monarchy and set up a republican state in Nepal.
 More than 10,000 Nepalese have been killed since the outbreak of the insurgency in February in 1996, according to government figures.

"4521",20061192,"Title: Hasina's ally upsets India.rtf; Date: December 27, 2006 Wednesday 1:26 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Dec 27 -- India has been completely taken aback by the recent alliance between the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Khelafat-e-Majlish (BKM). ""Certainly, we were not consulted,"" a senior diplomat said, when asked how India viewed the AL's alliance with the fundamentalist Islamic group. ""I am shocked, angered and more than slightly confused,"" a former High Commissioner of India to Bangladesh said.
  India is beset with serious concerns about security and mass migration of minorities into India in the run up to national elections in Bangladesh.
  Officials said the shift in the AL's traditionally secular orientation was more electoral in nature than ideological. The five-point Memorandum of Understanding between the AL and BKM outlines the primacy of Koranic rule, permits the issuance of fatwas and a parallel Shariat system of law, and says Ahmediyas (a minority community within Islam) are not Muslims. Mahfuz Anam, Editor-in-Chief of the leading newspaper, The Daily Star, said in a signed editorial on Wednesday, ""Now AL has shown that it is equally capable of betrayal of values and ethics in politics.""
  What was more worrying, according to diplomatic sources in Dhaka, was Sheikh Hasina's meeting with Pakistan's Ambassador to Bangladesh, Alamgir Babar, in Dhaka on Saturday (December 23) before announcing the alliance with the BKM. The Awami League, headed by Sheikh Hasina Wajed, has traditionally been viewed as more pro-Indian than its rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), headed by Begum Khaleda Zia, who relinquished the post of Prime Minister in October to permit elections to take place.
  The BNP's alliance with the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami in the 2001 elections set a precedent that has allowed Islamic fundamentalist groups like the Jagrata Mussalman Bangladesh (JMB) and Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami (HUJI) to spread within that country. That alliance has been blamed for allowing terrorist organizations affiliated to Al-Qaeda to take root in Bangladesh.According to Army Chief, General J J Singh, terrorists are using new routes from Nepal and Bangladesh to sneak into India, while security agencies are taking steps to block these entry points.
  ""As terrorists are finding it hard to penetrate the fence and new anti-infiltration systems placed all along the Line of Control in J&K and in Punjab,"" Singh said today on the sidelines of a meeting. Terrorists were now exploring new means to sneak into India, via Nepal and Bangladesh, he said.

 Dharan east Nepal , 8 October: Three youths of Taplejung east Nepal who killed their own commander in late May and surrendered to the government security forces, have not been able to return home. Pemba Sherpa, Pasang Sherpa and Birendra Limbu, who had been forcibly taken away by Maoists at different times, are taking shelter at the Itahari-based division headquarters of the army for the last four months.
 ""I don't want to stay here any more. But if I go home, the Maoists will kill me. What shall I do?"" laments Pemba.  passage omitted
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 9 Oct 04
The three youths had killed their own section commander Pemban Sherpa on 30 May at Thinglabung in the district. They admit that they killed their commander because he beat them up, made them carry heavy loads and barred them from going home. ""The Maoists used to say that those who do not obey and those who give trouble to others must be killed. That is what we did,"" said Pasang.
 The story does not end here. Prakash Shrestha of Bhojpur and 15-year-old Shukra Raj Baraili of Taplejung, who were arrested by the security forces during operations, are frustrated at not being able to go home. However, 11-year-old Raju Shrestha of Morang, who was also arrested during the operation, has been taken home by his guardians, it is stated.
 Pemba was taken away by the Maoists when he was returning home from school. Prakash, who was staying at a relative's and studying at school was taken away to the jungle by the Maoists. He was studying in grade eight. ""I said I do not want to drop my studies. They said such study was just futile,"" said Prakash.
 ""My parents had come to see me. They said that the Maoists had threatened to kill me if I returned home. For this reason, my father did not want to take me home,"" said Birendra Limbu. He still has vivid memories of his parents and his village.
 Pemba's relatives had also come see him at the division headquarters. ""The Maoists are in the village. They are not going to spare us because we killed the commander himself. That is why I am not going home,"" says Pemba. He frequently receives letters from his family members.
 Prakash wants to pursue his studies but at the same time he is fearful. ""My sister came to see me. She wanted to take me home. But I did not go for fear of the Maoists,"" he says. He was abducted by the Maoists on a charge of having sexual relations with a girl older than himself.

"7663",20113251,"Title: Martyr Ganga Lal's widow dies.rtf; Date: March 14, 2011 Monday; Text: KATHMANDU, March 14 -- Hasina Devi Shrestha lived revering the term martyr having been widowed at a young age of 20 after the martyrdom of Ganga Lal in 1941.
She had to endure the pain of the title of martyrdom being dragged down from its exalted status to the extent of vilification due to its rampant abuse. But she never complained.
""She was very frustrated and sad with the current state of the country but was too simple a person to abhor the way the term martyr was abused by politicians,"" Bijaya Lal, the youngest brother of Ganga Lal, said.
Her death at the age of 90 at Kathmandu Model Hospital Saturday night, for once, restored the sanctity of the much maligned term and the tributes flowing from the leaders didn't seem mundane for a change.
Born on May 9, 1920, Hasina Devi was married to Ganga Lal in 1933. She was pregnant when the Rana regime announced death sentence for him. She had given birth to their second son a day before he was to be executed on January 28.
Legend has it that Ganga Lal was taken for execution in a lorry that passed along the road in front of his abode in Pyafal. He had called her name in anguish but she could not answer him as she was in pain, having delivered a child just hours before.
""When they finally allowed the family to meet him for the last time, she could not visit him being in the later stage of pregnancy,"" says Bijaya Lal. Sadly, she couldn't even go for his cremation.
The Ranas were prepared to pardon the 21-year-old Ganga Lal in exchange for an apology due to his young age but he preferred to die in dignity rather than face ignominy of an unwarranted apology. ""The family tried to seek his release but never put pressure on him to apologize. She had no regrets for what he did,"" said Bijaya Lal who was raised by her like a son after the death of his mother in 1939.
During the family's last visit to the prison, Ganga Lal had asked his younger brother Pushpa Lal, who went on to become the founder general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal, to continue the fight. She lost her elder son just three years after Ganga Lal's execution but Hasina played her part by looking after his four kid brothers and two sisters while inspiring them to follow Ganga Lal's footsteps.
""Pushpa Lal bowed his head to her feet when she reached Tindhara Pathshala to welcome him after he became public following the end of Rana oligarchy in 1951,"" Bijaya Lal recalls.
Many leftist leaders tried to bring her into politics following the restoration of democracy in 1990. But she chose to live away from the limelight and led a simple life.
She is survived by son Shashi Lal and three grandchildren. Shashi lit Hasina's funeral pyre at Shobhabhagawati, the very place where her husband was shot dead, Sunday afternoon.

The deaths brought to six the number of people killed Wednesday, among them a protester shot by soldiers for reportedly trying to interfere with the municipal elections, the country's first vote in seven years.
The Defense Ministry said two rebels were killed when Maoist insurgents launched a major assault hours before polls opened on the eastern town of Dhankuta, where the guerrillas bombed at least 12 government buildings and destroyed the local bank.
The insurgents also killed one policeman and one civilian, and took seven government officials and three policemen hostage during the assault, a police official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
Another rebel was killed in a clash with soldiers in the western town of Dhangadi, the ministry said in a statement, without providing any additional details.

 Fungling, Taplejung, 14 August: A 16-year-old girl was killed while two others sustained serious injuries yesterday night when army personnel opened fire at a cultural function at Dobhan bazaar, Khamlung VDC village development committee of this hill district, according to the local administration.
 The deceased, identified as Goma Limbu of Thinglabu VDC, was sleeping on bed when a stray bullet hit her.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 15 Aug 03Two others, who were seriously injured, have been identified as Bidur Tamang, 18, and Durga Sonam, 11, both from Khamling VDC, located about 5 km from the district headquarters here. The injured minors were airlifted today to the Chhauni-based military hospital, Kathmandu, for treatment.
 Taplejung Chief District Officer Mohan Prasad Pokharel confirmed the deaths. He claimed that the incident took place when the security personnel clashed with the Maoists. Pokharel said the security personnel were sent to the bazaar for a patrol.
 Locals, however, refuted the official claim and said that no Maoists were sighted during the Lakhe Natch, a cultural function.

Nepal lifted Wednesday a daytime curfew clamped on the capital but arrested more demonstrators, including 25 journalists, as protests continued against King Gyanendra's absolute rule.
""The daytime curfew ... in Kathmandu and Lalitpur districts has been lifted until further notice,"" a newsreader on state-run Nepal Television said. A curfew remains in place at night.
The royal government also reiterated a willingness to talk with political parties spearheading the most intense spate of protests to restore democracy since the king seized power 14 months ago.
King Gyanendra ""has from the very outset emphasized on talks to resolve the problem,"" government spokesman Shrish Shumsher Rana was quoted as saying in the state-run Rising Nepal newspaper.
There was no reaction from opposition parties, but analysts said the monarch was becoming increasingly isolated by the protests and strike action coupled with increasingly strident international criticism.
Opposition parties planned to hold a rally in the centre of Kathmandu to mark the deaths of three protesters shot dead by troops at the weekend but a heavy police presence foiled the protest.
Handfuls of activists unfurled flags, and chanted ""Long live democracy, down with Gyanendra"" but were swiftly arrested.
Police were waiting for the protesters and bundled them into waiting police vans.
Some 20 activists were seen arrested over a space of two hours. There was no sign of large crowds.
Gongabu, on the outskirts of the capital, was quiet following clashes Tuesday between police and thousands of protestors.
Residents said police arrested around 100 people in the area during Tuesday night's curfew but there was no official confirmation.
Earlier Wednesday, police rounded up 25 journalists and five human rights activists who staged pro-democracy protests in an area where demonstrations were banned.
""Around 25 journalists and five activists have been detained from two separate protests in the Kathmandu valley this morning for protesting in a restricted area,"" a police officer told AFP.
Around 1,600 people, including prominent lawyers, politicians, activists and civilians, have been reported arrested in the past nine days since opposition parties launched the new round of protests. An unknown number have since been released.
People thronged the streets of Kathmandu to stock up on food after the end of the daytime curfew, imposed last Saturday on the capital and surrounding areas and renewed on a day-to-day basis.
""People are buying so many canned goods rice and oils, I think I'm going to run out of stock,"" said store owner Lakshmi Tamang.
""I'm terrified of running out of food if there are any more curfews,"" said housewife Rita Uprety who was out buying groceries.
While the general strike paralysed the nation for the first few days after it began Thursday, around 50 percent of businesses in Kathmandu's centre were ignoring the call and had opened their doors.
King Gyanendra, who has earned international condemnation for the escalating crackdown, has justified his power grab by saying politicians had failed to quell the decade-old Maoist insurgency, which has left 12,500 people dead.

 Text of report by Nepalese Channel Nepal TV on 13 July
 [Presenter] Former Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha has said that the king was forced to become active because political parties had invited anarchy in the country. Speaking at a programme in the capital yesterday, former Prime Minister Shrestha said, ""The king should take a revolution step to provide justice to the people."" He said that since the king is the source of disciplined behaviour, he needs to continue being active. Blaming the political parties for mainly being responsible for the growth of the Maoist problem, he said that it is the political parties who are responsible for the weakening of democracy. At a time when political parties are airing their comments regarding the constitution and the rule of law, Shrestha said that the main issue is not a piece of paper, but that justice to the people was the main issue. ""Therefore, those who want to talk about rule of law, they can come and discuss with me.""
Channel Nepal TV, Kathmandu, in Nepali 10:45 GMT, 13 Jul 05
[Shrestha] If only to provide justice to the people, to unite the people, the king must be active. The king has to provide a revolutionary leadership. I have told His Majesty time and again that there are class differences here. And for social justice, if the king does not take up the revolutionary step then this [the present crisis] is what will happen when the people take up the matter in their own hands. They start killing each other. This shows where the source of disciplined behaviour lies. You cannot only pay lip service to the concept of the rule of law. There should be justice. According to my principle, everyone should get justice, even the weak ones. A mere piece of paper will not bring about such justice. I see some agitating for the rule of law. They have been demanding that the king too remain within the law. Those gentlemen would come and talk to me about the issue as I have a lot of experience in these things. How much injustice has taken in the name of the rule of law. Many people have joined the Maoists in the jungles precisely because they got fed up with the widespread injustice.

  Thirteen-year-old Fido was rescued from ""madaaris"" or nomads, who train and use the animal for entertainment.
  The vets who operated on Fido said all necessary precautions would be taken for its recuperation.
  ""He (Fido) will be kept on antibiotics for at least six to eight days, so that no infection affects him. He will be on a liquid diet for over a week,"" said Doctor Atul Gupta, who operated on him.
  Explaining the cause of the tumour, A K Khare, Assistant Director of the Van Vihar National Park, said ""When the bear owners would have extracted its (bear) teeth, some portion of it would have remained inside, which made a wound leading to tumor.""
  The National Park has rescued 17 such bears from ""madaaris"".
  India had banned using bears for entertainment under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. But nomads still keep and use bears for entertainment at fairs and festivals.
  Sloth bears are one of the four types of bears found in India. They are also found in the lowland forests of Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
  These omnivorous animals are hunted by the poachers mainly for their gall bladder, which is believed to be a valuable ingredient of medicine.

The arrest of India's most revered Hindu leader, accused of masterminding the murder of a former aide, has astonished the country and stirred outrage among his millions of devotees who consider him a divine incarnation.
Ever since the detention Thursday of Jayendra Saraswati, known popularly as the ""Seer of Kanchi"" or the Kanchi Shankaracharya, supporters have been staging protests and hunger strikes in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
""It's as if you had arrested the Pope -- he's the biggest Hindu leader,"" Renuka Narayanan, religion editor of The Indian Express and author of several books on Hinduism, told AFP.
""Holy Seer, Unholy Mess,"" ran a banner headline in a weekend edition of The Hindustan Times over a report detailing allegations against the 71-year-old Saraswati, referred to in India as the ""pontiff"".
Formal charges have not yet been laid against Saraswati and his lawyers have described the accusations as false.
Just last year, political leaders feted Saraswati in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of his nomination as head of the hugely wealthy Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt -- Mutt means spiritual institution -- the leading seat of Hinduism.
Now he is in Vellore Central Prison in the holy town of Kanchipuram, accused of murder, conspiracy and suppressing evidence over the death of his ex-aide and former accountant Thiru Sankararaman, 52.
Media reports say there was a long history of friction between the spiritual leader and the dead man, who resented Saraswati's efforts to turn the Kanchi Mutt from a purely religious establishment into a social institution that helped the needy.
""He was very proactive. He has wanted to change the role of the Hindu pontiff. The previous Shankaracharya was very orthodox,"" said Narayanan. ""The new Shankaracharya was the first person to do 'walkabouts' in the slums.""
Sankararaman had also alleged financial irregularities at the temple. The 2,500-year-old Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt in the temple town controls assets worth over 50 billion rupees (1.14 billion dollars), newspaper reports say.
Media reports say Sankararaman wrote to a Tamil daily on August 30, vowing to remove Saraswati from the leadership of the Kanchi Mutt and alleging he was misusing his authority.
Four days later Sankararaman was found dead from multiple stab wounds after being attacked by five hitmen in another temple that he managed.
Police say they have records of phone conversations with the attackers as well as banknotes seized from the alleged killers that had been withdrawn by the Kanchi Mutt. Fourteen other people have been arrested in the case.
Prosecutors told the court at a weekend hearing there was ""sufficient evidence"" that Saraswati would flee to Nepal if released on bail.
Nepal's royal family are among his followers and he has often visited the world's only Hindu kingdom.
The prosecution petition opposing bail accused him of committing a ""heinous, calculated, well-designed and gruesome murder through rowdy elements on payment of money.""
Defence lawyers said Saraswati was framed and the phone calls could have been clandestinely made by someone else. His request for bail comes up again Wednesday.

Kathmandu, 20 February [Friday]: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal Friday admitted that the present government has failed to work as per the people's aspiration. 
He said the government has failed to make the people feel the sense of transformation because of the leg-pulling nature of political leaders. ""People had thought there would be many changes following the leadership of Prachanda but it is not happening,"" Dahal said. 
Prachanda is nom de guerre of PM Dahal. 
Inaugurating the first national convention of National Human Rights Concern Centre Nepal in the capital, the PM said he has failed to forge consensus with the leaders of other political parties despite leading the government. 
He claimed that the constitution drafting process has been delayed due to the attempts being made to topple the government by other parties and expressed his doubt over having peace in the country at the present context. 
PM Dahal said the rights cannot be secured unless basic needs including food, shelter and clothes of the general people are fulfilled. 
He also said they have been involved in the campaign for drafting a new constitution and establishing peace in the country.

 New Delhi, 5 November: Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that the Maoists in Nepal are trying to develop a link with India's Naxalites. He said that he had taken the matter seriously.
Kantipur, Kathmandu, in Nepali 6 Nov 04, p 1
Addressing the closing of a three-day meeting of the police chiefs from different Indian states on Friday 5 November , he expressed concerns over the rising leftist extremism and the violence it has ignited. ""Fighting the leftist extremism alone is not the ultimate goal,"" he said. ""The violence it has triggered is the central challenge for law and order.""
 Prime Minister Singh revealed that the Nepalese Maoists were trying to establish links with the Naxalites in different parts of India. The meeting of the police chiefs was held to face possible national security challenges posed by such Naxalite groups within and outside the country.
 The annual report published Friday by the Indian Ministry of Defence also states that Nepal's Maoists are threats to India's internal security. ""The increasing activities of the Maoists in Nepal's terai plain areas bordering with India are a matter of serious concern,"" the report states. The meeting of the police chiefs has also accepted that the rising activities of the Maoists is a challenge to the whole South Asia region.
 Meanwhile, Nepalese Ambassador to India Karnadhwoj Adhikari has said that India's assistance is vital to Nepal at a time when the Maoists are trying to establish links with other rebel outfits of South Asia.

The ""incentive"", say cartel owners, aims to boost clandestine narco-trade along the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bangladesh border in the state.
  The traffickers are suddenly finding themselves short-changed. A crackdown by the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the district police on smugglers has led to sharp decline in trade through the porous Indo-Nepal border over the past few months. Whiff of the ""offer"" came to light after the arrest of a few members of a trans-border cartel a couple of months ago in Araria's Jogbani block. One of the arrested druglords - Ram Sagar Rai - spilled the beans about the unique ""offer"".
  The arms to lure buyers are of Thai and Chinese make and are usually smuggled through Nepal. However, some smugglers are also peddling countrymade guns.
  According to the police, the drug trade in Araria is controlled by three gangs led by Bhagwan Yadav, Jakir Mian and Ram Sagar Rai - residents of Jogbani along the Indo-Nepal border. The syndicates are mostly family-owned. Widows of local drug traffickers often take over the reins as in the case of Bhagwan Yadav. Wife Damayanti Devi began calling the shots after his death. The trade is bulk in nature. Araria superintendent of police Paras Nath told the HT that heroin worth Rs 40 lakh was seized from smuggler Rai at the time of his arrest. The trail - spanning three countries - runs through Morang and Sansuri districts of Nepal and spreads to Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Jharkhand via Araria and Purnea.
  Kishaganj, another transit zone, is fed by the river route from Bangladesh, which opens out to Myanmar's ""Golden Triangle"". Heroin and charas top the demand list. The local market thrives on opium grown locally in Purnea. Recently, the district police destroyed standing crop in over two acres at Tikapatti village. Gangs led by Faizan, Shankar Singh of the North Bihar Liberation Army and Buchan Yadav run the trade with political patronage. Not only opium, ganja from Manipur has found its way to the state through Assam.

 Kathmandu, 4 October: King Gyanendra today lent support to the high-level peace committee's [HPC] peace initiatives and granted full authority to the government to hold talks with the Maoists, during an audience to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and members of the HPC at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace. The HPC, which was constituted to resume the derailed peace process with the Maoists, is headed by PM Deuba.
 The HPC members briefed the king about the efforts made so far by the committee to resume the peace process that had gone awry after the rebels pulled out of talks in August last year.
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 5 Oct 04
Emerging from the meeting, Deuba said the king extended ""complete backing"" to the HPC's efforts for peace. Rastriya Prajatantra Party president Pashupati Shumsher Rana told reporters ""the king has encouraged us to move ahead"".
 Sources added that the meeting between the king and the HPC team was planned to reassure the public that the HPC had the king's ""full backing"". The king is satisfied with the HPC's work and backed its moves, added the sources.
 CPN-UML [Communist Party of Nepal-Unified (Marxist-Leninist)] general secretary Nepal, who is among the five HPC members, said their meeting with the king had further established the fact that the government had ""full authority"" to hold talks with the Maoists.
 Maoist supremo Prachanda, in a statement issued on 23 September, had posed six queries before the government, challenging its credibility and the government's stance on the demand of constituent assembly and UN involvement. The Maoist leadership has, however, not responded to the government's stance and its repeated calls for talks that were first made public through the media on 30 September.
 But a highly-placed source told this daily that the Maoist reaction might come by Friday [8 October], as human rights activists and other leaders are mounting pressure on them to declare a unilateral cease-fire during the festive season.
 Meanwhile, the HPC held its third formal meeting earlier in the day, discussing a code of conduct for its members and possible ways of declaring a cessation of hostilities between the two warring sides during Dashain and Tihar. ""But no decision was taken,"" informed the source.
 The sources said the HPC would begin appointing experts on various disciplines and other staff required for the HPC secretariat after Minister of Information and Communication Dr Mohammad Mohsin, who leaves on Middle East tour tomorrow, returns on Monday. [passage omitted]

"6336",2007940,"Title: The changing face of Kashmir militants.rtf; Date: October 3, 2007 Wednesday 3:53 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, Oct. 3 -- The hot-tempered Manipuri was a long way from home. The first known Lashkar-e-Tayyaba militant from the Northeast, he had lost his way in the mountains of Kashmir, after walking out in a huff from his camp with an AK-47.
  The arrest of Shibil Umar of Manipur's Thoubal district, security officials say, highlights the changing face of Kashmir's militant, as rebels recruit people from other parts of India, as well as Myanmarese refugees, Nepalese and Bangladeshis so that they don't have the easily identifiable Kashmiri features and can melt into communities.
  ""Militant groups in Kashmir are shifting their attention to different-looking people who can mix in - like Indians from other areas, Nepalis or Bangladeshis,"" said a security official in Kashmir. That has also partly been forced by the sharply-reducing infiltration from PoK and the severe reduction in Kashmir Valley recruitments. One officer compared it to the recently reported attempt by the al-Qaida to recruit White recruits in the West.
  Manipur, home to India's most complex insurgency, has not been known to have any previous link with Kashmir's militancy, until three Manipuri youth were arrested from near the Red Fort in the Capital last year on suspicion of being militants. Other suspects are from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and other areas, sent to operate in their respective areas, not the Valley.
  The Kashmir police have cautioned their UP counterparts that Nepali Muslim youth are reportedly being ""preached subversive and pro-militant activities"" in a madrasa in Muzaffarnagar. A Nepali man was arrested recently in Kashmir and accused of having links with militants, but the charges are not proved so far.
  More recently, 15 Arakanese Muslims from Myanmar were arrested in the border town of Moreh in Manipur in August for suspected terror links. The Myanmarese - Rohingya Muslims of western Myanmar's Arakan state - are virtually stateless citizens. They allege long years of persecution in Myanmar, have no legal rights, even to buy property; are reportedly forbidden from travelling or marrying without permission.
  Indian officials say thousands are entering India illegally through the porous border where surveillance is extremely difficult due to the rough terrain. ""The oppressed Arakanese are easy targets for groups like the Lashkar,"" said the security official in Manipur.
  In Kashmir, ""the Manipuri boy arrested here did not come to become a terrorist, I am pretty certain of that. He got sucked into it,"" a security official said. But Umar mirrors what officials say is the story of many other youth from outside Kashmir.
  In his Mayum Leikei village in Manipur, Umar studied in a local madrasa, then went to Muzaffarnagar in the sugar stronghold of Uttar Pradesh in 2001 to study at another madrasa, he told his interrogators. Two years later, he shifted to a madrasa in Meerut, but was soon expelled by the amir (chief) after a scuffle with another student. He then worked at a factory of embroidered clothes in Ghaziabad for Rs 2,400 a month, renting a cloth merchant's home with three other Manipuri youth. They included Afsaan, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, a Manipuri rebel group.
  In the winter of 2006, Umar was introduced in Muzaffarnagar to an Indian and a Nepali man, both allegedly from the Lashkar, at a madrasa where many Nepali Muslim youth come to study. In April 2007, the Nepali man - identified by police as Anwar-ul-Haq - allegedly took Umar and Afsaan by train and subsequently in a Sumo to a training camp, where they were taught to handle an AK-47, an M-20 pistol and to throw grenades.
  In August, Umar had another scuffle with a trainer, and left the camp with the trainer's AK-47 and his own .303 rifle, wandered as a stranger through hilly terrain before being arrested by police.

"7581",20117054,"Title: Once upon a time in Biratnagar.rtf; Date: August 8, 2011 Monday; Text: Nepal, Aug. 8 -- I am writing this commentary because one of the most serious and condemnable cases of attack on a media personnel is almost being morphed into oblivion. It has become a past, a fiction. Three months after Parshuram Basnet masterminded a lethal attack on Republica & Nagarik Journalist Khilanath Dhakal, which was followed by an excavation of the former's past criminal activities, things have come to stand at what I had predicted in my two previous write-ups ""Mired in criminalism"" (June 19) and ""When crime reigns supreme""(June 29). Mighty Basnet is still at large but safe and sound, visible only to his aides and bosses and ""invisible"" to police authorities. Nepal Police have regarded him as a person too righteous to be brought under detention. Cries for his arrest have ceased to echo anymore. Federation of Nepalese Journalist (FNJ) that organized marches in the scorching heat of June in Biratnagar and Kathmandu streets demanding his arrest has become tired and forced into quietism. And the end result: The Dhakal attack has become a once upon a time in Biratnagar story.
In the past three months, Dhakal's wounds have partly healed. He is back to work. Thanks to his guts and unwavering commitment to report the truth, he has continued penning commentaries on the nefarious deeds of Youth Force goons and their ringleaders. The last I met him, he was in Kathmandu. He is no match for the wrestler like perpetrators and their godfathers. He is lean, does not speak much and keeps a low profile. He retains the blue stains round his eyes that he received from the devils on June 5. He looks visibly traumatized but has managed to suppress it. Looking at him, I had a feeling: How could those muscular men have thought of beating him with the intent of killing him? He could have been subdued by a single blow. How could it have ever occurred to KP Oli's comprehension that he had been boozing and incited his opponents into a row? Before he left for Biratnagar, he came to my work station. ""I am leaving today,"" he said, grave and thoughtful. ""Well, be safe"" my colleague responded to which he did not reciprocate verbally. He seemed to be saying ""Well, whether or not I will be safe in Biratnagar is another issue but I will not give up what I have been doing: Exposing these heinous humans.""
It is not hard to fathom why he took risk in reporting the nexus of politically-backed crimes. An honest journalist as he is, he was constantly on the lookout for the factors that rupture law and justice. And because he had to suffer in the hands of a few, his creative fury knew no bounds when he came to know about their misdeeds. Perhaps this impulse may have triggered Dhakal to report on Basnet's crime despite knowing how high above the law he was. It is also understandable why Basnet could not stand it. People like Basnet are built of different stuff. Dhakal posed as the one and the only threat to the sustenance of his empire. In silencing him, Basnet could silence all possible dissents from Biratnagar denizens. Basnet tendency does not function only on these principles. Some human beings are pampered by secret devilry. They simply cannot resist the temptation to being inhuman and killer. I am thinking of a 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik, the man behind Oslo carnage that killed about 100 people apparently for no genuine reason.
Basnet may not be Breivik's equal, but in terms of remorselessness, they share most features. Breivik was as unaffected and unmoved by his deeds as Basnet and his aides appeared on the first week of June. The degree of atrocity and inhumanity may be different but, in essence, both share the same temperament: To kill, to injure and to disregard the law of the land.
It is a disquieting truth for the writers and journalists to bear but this is perhaps the first time in recent memory in which journalists' pleas for justice have been ignored by the authorities. It is because journalists' movement was not just against the government. Had it been so, perhaps it would have won the battle. When Republica broke news about the duplicitous and dubious identity of one State Minister for Finance Lharkyal Lama, who is as much CPN-UML as Basnet, Jhalanath Khanal government decided to do without him. When Republica unraveled the fraudulence of Unity International, its founders had to abscond elsewhere. So the power of pen is not something to be taken lightly. But this time FNJ's adversaries came in the form of KP Olism. KP Olism is a philosophy of crime, thuggery, power, muscle and money. It is spreading insidiously in UML. This ism, unlike Marxism and Leninism that principally rein UML, believes in the survival of the richest and the wealthiest, expands its empire at the cost of anything and takes resort to slander politics. It advocates justice, rule of law, democracy and press freedom, but is bent on flouting these ideals in practice. It is above the authorities and beyond the grip of the government. Against th"

    Minister Tripathi tendered his resignation to Prime Minister  Girija Prasad Koirala through the Chief Secretary Monday.
    ""The eight parties have failed to show the level of seriousness that merits the present situation.

    Central committee members of the Nepal Sadhbhawana Party ( Anandidevi) had recently urged the party to leave the coalition  government accusing the government to have ""suppressing the  Madheshi movement in the Terai region"".

The Forum claimed that one of its members was shot dead by a cadre of the Communist Party of Nepal (formerly known as guerrilla).  MPRF later collided with policemen, which rendered six people's  death.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour told a news conference she would meet Nepal's prime minister and Maoist leader to seek an end to ""impunity"" and see that a fair legal system is established.
""I don't underestimate the challenges that the country faces,"" Arbour said in the capital Kathmandu.
She called for ""ending the long-standing practices of impunity and ensuring that those responsible for terrible victimization of innocent people, for their perpetration of very serious human rights violations, are brought to account.""
Under a peace pact in November the Maoists agreed to end their ""people's war"", in which at least 12,500 people were killed, and join mainstream politics.
The royal army and the rebels were repeatedly accused of gross human rights violations during the insurgency in which civilians paid a high price.
Arbour sought a system that is ""transparent, credible and does justice particularly to those who tragically lost their lives or disappeared -- and there are many of those during this very prolonged conflict.""
She was to meet Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Maoist leader Prachanda during her six-day visit.
""The question of impunity is one that will remain very present on our agenda.
""With that we take very seriously also the reconstruction of a strong, robust but fair criminal justice and law enforcement system.
""This I think will serve the country well as it embraces very strong democratic principle.""
The Maoists began handing over weapons Wednesday. On Thursday they dissolved their ""people's government"", which had controlled large swathes of the Himalayan nation.

"7401",20117443,"Title: We are the people our parents warned us about.rtf; Date: November 18, 2011 Friday; Text: Nepal, Nov. 18 -- Nepal adopts the Narcotics Drugs (Control) Act, 2033 (1976). Section 3(a) of the Act specifies narcotic drugs as cannabis, medicinal cannabis, opium, processed opium, plants and leaves of coca, any substance prepared with mixing opium, coca extract which include mixtures or salts, any natural or synthetic narcotic drug or psychotropic substance and their salts and other substance as may be specified by the Nepal Gazette notification.
Any person violating this Act shall be punishable by upto 20 years of imprisonment and a fine.
Recently, an acquaintance of a friend of mine was caught in the possession of 50 grams of marijuana. He now faces upto 20 years in prison.
According to statistics, a first-time drug offender generally spends more time in a prison cell than violent first-time offenders.
You are, in short, less likely to go to prison for kicking an old lady down the stairs in a busy supermarket in front of multiple witnesses than you are for being caught in possession of 50 grams of marijuana. Call me soft-hearted, but that seems a little unusual.
Never mind that you are, say, 22 years old and of a previously good character, but the incident will probably ruin your life, and that it will probably cost the city a few hundred thousand to keep you imprisoned.
Never mind that perhaps you did not even know you had some leftover from last year's Holi party at this hippie joint in Thamel, or that maybe someone asked you to hold on to it for him.
Never mind any explanatory circumstances whatsoever. This is Nepal and there are no exceptions where drugs are concerned.
Of course, you may still be able to shoot a high-profile religious leader in broad daylight and stroll leisurely away from the scene with a video released thereafter showing the policemen in the area running away from the scene of the shooting instead of confronting the shooters like we usually expect them to.
In all this, please understand that I have no remote intention to speak in favor of drugs of any sort. I understand that drugs can mess you up in a big way.
There is Puru, a fellow in my neighborhood who has made one trip too many to the local drugstore in his days, and since that time he is on the road next to my house with a transfixed smile on his face staring at the sun.
So I know what drugs can do. Only, I have not reached the point where it seems appropriate to sentence a promising 22-year-old for a first-time offence, in short, for being foolish enough to ruin his life and deprive him of any chance of redeeming himself.
The saddest part of this enthusiastic meanness is that it simply does not seem to ever work. Just look at the amount of drugs that are available, say, on a stroll down the streets of Thamel. Never mind that there are a couple of police stations within a couple of hundred meters and undercover policemen all over the place.
We have been spending millions, if not billions, and some of them generous donor funds, on acquiring SUVs and fancy uniforms, complete with two sets of caps, one each for the summer and winter, I am told, and yet drug use goes unabated with each passing generation.
Frustrated, the police set up late-night checkpoints during weekends until we find ourselves at the point where you can be sent to a prison for upto 20 years for possessing the botanical equivalent of two bottles of vodka, which, let us face it, despite the ban, is readily available in every neighborhood. And no one seems to question it.
My solution to the problem would be twofold. First, I would make it mandatory for the policemen manning the late-night checkpoints in the Valley to be sober, at least while they are on duty.
This would not do anything to reduce the drug problem, but it would make me feel much better when I am driving home in the evening after dinner with my wife. Then I would take most of the millions allocated for the fight against drugs and spend it on rehabilitation and prevention.
Some of the money could be put to good use by bringing busloads of youngsters to my neighborhood to meet Puru, the guy who sits with a transfixed smile on his face, staring at the sun the entire day.
I am sure he would be able to persuade most of them not to try drugs in the first place. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at

Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 23 August
Kathmandu, [Thursday] 23 August: The government has started the work of identifying, mapping, fencing and marking landmines in different parts of the country planted during the decade-long insurgency, said Ram Chandra Poudel, minister for peace and reconstruction, on Wednesday.
The government had formed a directional and technical committee under the coordination of Poudel on 21 June to start mine action works. Poudel, speaking at a national conference on landmines organized by Ban Landmines Campaign Nepal (NCBL), said the committee has started identifying, defusing and excavating the landmines.
He also urged the Nepali army, Maoists, experts and related organizations to help in the committee's work to minimize the probable death and destruction due to the landmines in the future.
Purna Shova Chirakar, coordinator of the NCBL, said over 26,000 people have been handicapped due to the landmines and almost 14,00 have lost their lives in the last 12 years. She accused the government and the political parties of lacking dedication to tackle the risk posed by landmines.
In the peace accord signed on 22 November, 2006, the government and the Maoists had expressed commitment to assist each other to mark the landmines by providing necessary information within 30 days and defuse and excavate them within 60 days. But the commitment is yet to be implemented.
United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Matthew Kahane said there is an urgent need to destroy the landmines. He added that the government should address the problems of those injured and handicapped by the landmines.
Tamrat Samuel, deputy special representative of the secretary-general, called for the formulation of a mine action policy. He also called for the protection of rights of those injured and handicapped by the landmines.
Sunita Ghale, who lost her right leg, and Krishna Bahadur Ghising, whose lower body has been paralysed due to a landmine explosion, accused the government of showing indifference to their plight. ""We have been finding it difficult to continue medications and fend for the family and children,"" they said and urged the government to support them.
It takes three to 10 dollars to produce a landmine, while it takes anywhere between 200 and 1,000 dollars to destroy it, according to the NCBL.

Holding them responsible for the delay in peace process, Paudel claimed that the Maoists would understand their mistakes only if they were separated from the government. He was speaking at a programme organised by BP Koirala Bichar Samaj on the occasion of 29th death anniversary of BP Koirala in the district today.
On the occasion, Paudel said that he asked Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal for several times to sideline the Maoists from the government. But the prime minister expressed his reluctance to do so in the name of peace process, according to him.
The leader of main opposition party, Paudel further charged that the Maoist party was never serious towards the conclusion of peace process. ""Completion of peace process is not possible if the past pacts were not implemented,"" he said, stressing on the essence of Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) after which the former rebels joined the mainstream politics five years ago.
Paudel criticised Prime Minister Khanal and the Maoists for failing to form a national consensus government, demanding that the leader of ruling coalition gave up the prime ministerial berth in order to pave the way for new equation.
Stressing on implementation of the five-point deal struck by the three main political parties to extend the Constituent Assembly's term on May 28/29, Paudel said that his party would take to agitation to if the draft of new constitution was not drafted by August 28.
Speaking at the same programme, former Deputy Speaker Chitra Lekha Yadav accused the communist parties of pushing the country backward by ignoring the prime tasks of peace building and constitution-making, and opined that the ""communist polarisation"" should be brought to an end.

The fighting in the west killed seven people, including a civilian, and 25 soldiers were reported missing after the raid, the latest in a string of rebel attacks that marred the municipal polls, Nepal's first elections in seven years.
The Maoist rebels have been fighting for a decade to create a socialist state. The insurgency has claimed about 12,000 lives.
King Gyanendra seized power a year ago, saying he needed to toss out an interim government to stamp out the rebellion and bring order to a chaotic and corrupt political scene. He promised to restore full democracy within three years, and said Wednesday's election was a first step.
The rebels launched repeated attacks during the campaign and threatened to kill anyone who took part in the elections. Two candidates were slain.
The attacks continued Friday when an army convoy traveling along the East-West highway near Sunwal, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of Katmandu, was ambushed by rebels hiding in a forest along the edge of the road, said Niranjan Baral, the top official in the area.
Two soldiers and a civilian were killed in the nighttime assault, the Royal Nepalese Army said, adding that at least 20 of its soldiers were injured and another 25 were missing.
The Maoist rebels' said in a statement on their Web site that 10 soldiers were being held hostage.
The insurgents said four of their fighters were killed and an unspecified number injured in the ensuing gunbattle, which lasted for hours. They also said they had seized several weapons and at least three army trucks.
After fighting subsided, army helicopters hovered over the area searching for the attackers.
Hours later, Nepal's Election Commission announced that pro-government candidates, as expected, had won most of the elections for mayors and local officials. Three pro-government parties won 17 mayoral posts while independent candidates, none of whom are anti-king, won 15.
Following the announcement, Katmandu's mayor-elect, Rajaram Shrestha, said, ""I understand the problems faced by the city and my priority will be to tackle these problems.""
Nearly every major political party boycotted the vote, calling it an attempt by the king to legitimize his power grab, and they have claimed the low turnout about 20 percent as a victory.
The vote has also been rejected by key international allies as deeply flawed because of the boycott, rebel attacks and threats, and government intimidation.
Six people were killed on election day, including a protester shot by soldiers.
The United States called the elections a ""hollow attempt"" to legitimize the king's rule.
Britain said it did not believe the elections were meaningful exercise and believed the low turnout indicated they did not have public support.

Negotiations between the government and the United Democratic Mahadhesi Front (UDMF) continued over the weekend into the early hours of Monday, and ""only a few minor details are left"" to resolve, a UDMF leader said.
""We will continue the talks again after a few hours of rest. All the leaders are tired,"" UDMF negotiator Anil Kumar Jha told AFP.
""We will definitely reach consensus. Most of the things are sorted out, only a few minor details are left,"" he said.
The UDMF, which claims to represent Mahadhesis who make up around half of Nepal's 27 million people who live in the southern Terai plains along the border with India, have been blockading Kathmandu for nearly two weeks.
The group is demanding greater political clout for the Mahadhesis, who have long complained of being left out of the corridors of power by Nepal's hill elite.
Their strike has shut the road between India and Kathmandu, the corridor for most of the country's imports.
The unrest flared after a 2006 peace deal between the Maoists and government, and has intensified in recent weeks with at least two Mahadhesi protesters killed in clashes with police.
The government has been struggling to end the strike before polls planned for April 10, which will elect a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution and most likely abolish the world's last Hindu monarchy.
The European Union and United Nations have warned the polls will be impossible to organise unless the unrest is ended.

 Kathmandu, 9 May: The government and Maoists made incremental progress in the second round of peace talks today with the former agreeing to release a few jailed rebels and even limiting the Royal Nepal Army to within 5 km of their barracks. The two sides also announced the formation of a monitoring and evaluation committee to oversee the implementation of the all-important code of conduct which governs behaviour during peace negotiations. The measures were announced after three hours of negotiations at Shanker Hotel in Kathmandu after the second round of peace negotiations on Friday 9 May .
 Later, addressing a joint-press conference, both sides said the talks were held in a cordial atmosphere and dwelt in large part on the list of demands put forth by the Maoists in the first round. Minister Narayan Singh Pun and rebel negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who addressed the news conference jointly, announced the small but significant progress in today's talks.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 10 May 03
Pun said that the government agreed not to mobilize its armed forces for search operations beyond a perimeter of 5 km from the barracks. The government also agreed to expedite the process of releasing the Maoist leaders who are in government custody and decided to immediately release three of them. He added that the process of releasing the Maoist leaders would be expedited as per the government's commitment made during the first round of peace talks on 27 April. Neither side, however, said whether the Maoists too had promised to limit their fighters from roaming inside the areas under the control of security forces.
 In the press conference, both Pun and Mahara stressed that the talks dwelt at length on the agendas put forward by the Maoists during the first round of peace talks. ""There was no new agenda entertained during today's talks,"" said Mahara, the spokesman of the Maoist negotiating team. He added that the government had asked for some more time to do homework on the political agendas the Maoists. ""Today's meeting just revolved around the measures to facilitate and manage the peace dialogue in the future,"" he added.
 ""We have arrived at an agreement to enter the political agendas of the Maoists,"" said Narayan Singh Pun, the spokesman of the government negotiating team. ""Discussions on the political agendas will be held after the matter is intensively discussed at the home work committee,"" he said. The homework committee was formed during the last peace talks comprising two members from both sides. Pun and Ramesh Nath Pandey are representing the government side, while Mahara and Ram Bahadur Thapa (Badal) from the Maoists.
 The Maoists had put forward a 24-point agenda before the government, including three major political demands. They have demanded for convening a round table conference of all the political forces in the country, formation of an interim government under their leadership and writing of a new constitution through constituent assembly.
 The implementation of the code of conduct was one of the major concerns from the both sides in the light of allegations coming from the both sides for violating it. Pun said the code of conduct could not be implemented due to technical shortcomings from the both sides. ""Some managerial aspects are responsible for our partial failure to abide by the code of conduct but it will be corrected at the earliest,"" said Pun.
 As informed during today's press conference, both the negotiating parties said they have decided to form a 13-member committee to monitor the implementation of the code of conduct for cease-fire they agreed on 13 March and the ongoing peace process.
 The monitoring committee will consist of one representative each from six institutions such as National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Nepal Bar Association (NBA), Federation of Nepalese Journalist (FNJ), National Women Commission (NWC), Nepal Dalit Association (NDA), Association of Nepalese Nationalities (ANN) and Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI). NHRC representative will head the committee. Other individual members in the committee are Bal Krishna Neupane, Hem Bahadur Singh, Khim Lal Devkota, Malla K. Sundar, Dr Birendra Jhapali and D.R. Lamichhane.
 Today's talks also formulated a code of conduct for the monitoring committee ""with a view to make its functions systematic"". As per the code of conduct made at the talks today, the monitoring team will be responsible for interpreting the code of conduct in case of differences.

"3724",2005619,"Title: Beant killer, two others held for blasts.rtf; Date: June 8, 2005 Wednesday 1:32 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, June 8 -- THE CHIEF of the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) in India and a main accused in the Delhi cinema hall blasts case were among three members of the militant outfit arrested by the Delhi Police here on Wednesday.
  A huge quantity of arms and ammunition was recovered from them.
  Babbar Khalsa India chief Jagtar Singh Hawara, a key accused in former Punjab CM Beant Singh's assassination case, had escaped from Chandigarh's Burail jail in January 2004. Police commissioner K.K. Paul described him as an ""important"" catch.
  The other two militants were Jaspal Singh, considered the brain behind the blasts at Liberty and Satyam cinemas in Delhi, and his associate Vikas Sehgal.
  Paul said preliminary interrogation of the suspects revealed that BKI militants were trying to revive militancy in Punjab and the Delhi blasts were just a prelude to that. ""With the arrest of the militants, the blast case is now closed. But it is important to understand the larger designs of the militant group,"" he said.
  The militants were produced before a city court and have been remanded in police custody till June 20.
  The three militants were in a brand new Hyundai Accent that was loaded with 10.35 kg RDX, 4 English pistols, 207 live cartridges, 3 fired shells, remote-controlled blast devices and hand grenades when the police intercepted them at Alipur in north-west Delhi on Wednesday morning.
  ""The fact that they managed to smuggle in so many explosives into the Capital suggests that they had special plans for Delhi. We are yet to interrogate them on this. The militants were in Delhi to meet a contact dealing in hawala money after which they would have left for Nepal,"" said Paul.

It is the first arrest anywhere in connection with the bombings. The man was held by Nepal's anti-terrorist police on Saturday at his flat in Kathmandu's Baluwatar neighbourhood, the officer said on condition of anonymity.
""He was arrested on suspicion of his links with the Mumbai blasts,"" he added, explaining that police were probing text messages and phone calls sent to someone in Mumbai. 
The arrest is likely to give hope to police in India's commercial capital who have struggled for clues despite the deployment of forensic teams and top detectives in the wake of the blasts. 
The explosions were the first attack on the city since the traumatic November 2008 assault that left 166 dead. 
Nepal police spokesman Nawaraj Dhakal said he was unable to confirm the arrest.
""I have heard about the arrest. But I am also collecting information about it. I can't say for sure now whether he's been arrested or not,"" he said.
No group has claimed responsibility for the explosions, which targeted jewellery and diamond trading hubs as well as a residential area.
Initial suspicion has fallen on the home-grown Indian Mujahideen, which previously claimed to have been behind a string of similar blasts across the country in 2008.

"6708",20083877,"Title: India floods strand hundreds of thousands.rtf; Date: August 31, 2008 Sunday 1:26 AM GMT; Text: The deluge came and turned his world to water, so Umesh Kushyaha decided to build a boat.
Kushyaha hammered nails into his rickety-looking wooden row boat on the side of the road, a lone strip of dry land that cuts across miles (kilometers) of water. He was preparing Saturday for what authorities say will be months more of life submerged under flood waters.
About 1.2 million people have been left homeless and scores killed in the impoverished state of Bihar in the two weeks since the monsoon-swollen Kosi river in neighboring Nepal burst its banks, dramatically changing course and spilling billions of gallons (liters) of water into the plains of northern India.
Authorities say hundreds of thousands remain stranded after their homes and villages were inundated, clinging to the roofs of houses or whatever dry speck of land they can find. An estimated 3 million residents of Bihar have been affected.
Those who could flee fled, piling their families, goats, chickens and sacks of grain into boats and heading for safety. Some waded for miles (kilometers) through the waters, carrying bundles of their belongings on their heads as they sought refuge.
But as the waters rushed in and flooded more than 750 villages and towns, many were unable to escape. Twenty people drowned Friday when their rescue boat capsized.
By Saturday, some 330,000 people had been rescued, said Prataya Amrit, secretary of the state's disaster management department. Many of them were being housed in state-run relief camps.
But while rescue efforts buoyed by a $200US million Indian government relief fund were finally picking up steam, officials warned the flooding was spreading to new areas and the high waters would last for months.
Authorities say the breach in the Kosi embankment is more than a mile (kilometer) wide and growing every day, and they will not be able to fix it until late November, when the monsoon ends and the torrent begins to subside.
""Since they say the waters will be here until the end of October, I'm making a boat,"" said Kushyaha, a 49-year-old farmer from the badly hit Saharsa district, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) northeast of New Delhi.
""We will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies,"" he said.
At a nearby relief camp set up in a four-room high school, teachers said the government had asked them to look after people for two months.
""From tonight, we will begin supplying them with cooked food,"" said Rameshwar Prasad Mandal pointing to sacks of rice and lentils stored in a classroom under the watchful eye of a portrait of Indira Gandhi, India's prime minister in the 1970s.
For many of the 800 people in the camp, it will be the first hot meal since the floods.
India's monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, brings rain vital for the country's farmers but also often causes massive destruction.
This flooding, however, is different from the annual monsoon deluge.
Apart from the roads, the vast plains have been turned into a massive lake, with only an occasional tree or rooftop breaking the surface.
The waters are deceptively placid in places but swirling and menacing in others where dozens of workers pile sandbags and rocks on the road embankments, trying to strengthen them and prevent these last vital links from being washed away.
Those who have made it to the few points of high ground consider themselves lucky. The government has some 900 boats carrying out rescue operations but they have not even penetrated some regions.
The government says it has not yet been able to asses the extent of the devastation, which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described as a national calamity.
""We will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes,"" said Amrit. ""But it is colossal.""

"4385",20061612,"Title: Nepal opposition vows to keep up anti-royal protests.rtf; Date: April 10, 2006 Monday 1:19 AM GMT; Text: Protestors vowed to continue protests Monday to pressure Nepal's royal government to restore democracy, after a four-day strike and violent street rallies brought the country to a standstill.
""From Monday, the ongoing demonstrations against the unconstitutional and autocratic regime will continue in Kathmandu and across the country,"" the Joint Mass Movement Coordination Committee said a statement received late Sunday.
The protest organizers hailed the strike as a success, despite three protesters being killed by security forces and hundreds of demonstrators being arrested for breaking a curfew and a ban on protesting.
""The four-day nationwide general strike was a huge success and has gained a new height,"" the organizers said.
Opposition parties ousted when King Gyanendra sacked the government 14 months ago had called the general strike along with a protest in the capital on Saturday in a bid to pressure the king to restore democracy.
Maoist rebels meanwhile vowed to take control of highways and destroy all statues of the royal family.
""The People's Liberation Army will take control of all the highways, and people will be mobilized to stop paying taxes to the royal regime,"" said a statement signed by Prachanda, the Maoist leader and his deputy.
Opposition parties entered a loose alliance with the rebels last November and just before the strike the Maoists announced a ceasefire around the capital in an effort to help the political parties.
The government crackdown on the anti-royal side has resulted in a new wave of international criticism for Nepal, the world's last Hindu monarchy.
Nepal has rejected the criticism, with the home minister saying that the international community was not aware of the ""ground reality"" in Nepal.
Before the protest slated for Saturday, the government rounded up hundreds of political activists, slapped a ban on protests, imposed a daytime curfew and cut off mobile telephones.
The moves were necessary because rebel Maoists had infiltrated the protest movement, ministers said.
""There is terrorist infiltration in this whole thing,"" Shrish Shamsher JB Rana, Minister for Information and Communication told AFP late Sunday.
""What they (the opposition parties) call a peaceful protest is not peaceful,"" Rana said.
Sunday saw clashes between protesters and security forces in at least 10 places around the outskirts of Kathmandu that were not covered by the curfew.
Some 451 people were arrested Sunday, Home Minister Kamal Thapa said. 
Gyanendra sacked the government and took absolute power in February 2005. He said politicians were corrupt and had failed to quell a decade-old Maoist insurgency that has left at least 12,500 people dead.

"612",20033259,"Title: U.N. Offices in Congo Are Attacked.rtf; Date: September 16, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Unidentified attackers fired on United Nations offices in the northeastern Congolese town of Bunia on Tuesday, a day after U.N. troops detained army and security chiefs of a tribal militia, a U.N. spokesman said.
Leocadio Salmeron, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Congo, said U.N. troops fired into the air to disperse a crowd of demonstrators outside the office and no one was hurt. But Etienne Membe Ngona, the deputy security chief for the Union of Congolese Patriots, or UPC, said one person was killed and three others wounded by the U.N. troops.
The assailants were hiding among the demonstrators protesting the detention of Floribert Kisembo, UPC chief of staff, and Rafiki Saba, the security chief of the same main Hema tribal faction, Salmeron said by telephone from Bunia.
Also in Bunia Tuesday, a U.N. helicopter gunship fired on 10 fighters in a pickup truck after they aimed their weapons at the Indian air force aircraft, Salmeron said. He said two of the unidentified fighters were wounded and the truck sped out of town.
The UPC commanders were detained Monday after U.N. troops found four AK-47 assault rifles, several rounds of ammunition, six anti-personnel mines and a hand grenade buried on the grounds of the home of UPC head Thomas Lubanga, Salmeron said.
Lubanga is in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, 1,056 miles southwest of Bunia, the main town in restive Ituri province.
The arms and ammunition were discovered after the U.N. ordered armed groups in Bunia to hand in weapons, including those held by bodyguards of militia leaders.
The U.N. troops from Bangladesh, Uruguay, Pakistan, Nepal and India are pushing to secure Bunia before deploying in the rest of the province the size of Belgium. On Sept. 1, the U.N. force replaced a French-led emergency force that largely stabilized the town after arriving in June to stem fighting between the UPC and a rival Lendu tribal faction. Some 500 people were killed in that fighting.
UPC supporters clashed sporadically with U.N. troops Monday following the weapons discovery and the subsequent detention of key commanders, Salmeron said, adding that at least two civilians were wounded.
Ngona said, however, that one person had been killed and seven others wounded in the clashes Monday between U.N. troops and angry residents protesting the arrest of the UPC commanders.
""Reports that my fighters clashed with U.N. troops are pure lies. We have not fired a single bullet. It was never necessary to fire shots,"" Lubanga said by telephone from Kinshasa. ""People are angry over the arrest of Rafiki and Kisembo"" together with the UPC military security chief and 40 bodyguards.
The Hema and Lendu have traditionally clashed over land and resources in the resource-rich Ituri. That fighting became more deadly in 1999, when they were armed with modern weapons and used as proxies by the Congolese government and rebels, and their foreign backers who fought in the civil war. At least 50,000 people have been killed.
The war broke out in August 1998 when Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila.

 The delayed shipment of 500 Minimis automatic rifles manufactured by Belgium's Fabrique Nationale Herstal arrived in the capital Tuesday 7 January night nearly a fortnight after the Indian government denied a chartered airliner permission to overfly India and land in land-locked Nepal, official Nepali sources said.

 The Belgian government resisted pressures of a Green Party and human rights groups to send the purchased arms shipment to Nepal to modernize the Royal Nepal Army.
 The arms consignment comes after the delivery by USA of 3,000 MI-16 A 2 rifles to Nepal last week.

"7589",20117391,"Title: Plights of domestic workers.rtf; Date: May 26, 2011 Thursday; Text: Nepal, May 26 -- Between the constitution not being drafted, the yuppies' rally against that fact, CK Lal's observation to their reaction and the response to that observation, there has been little else discussed, on and offline, these past few days in Kathmandu. This includes the recent international scandal to hit most other non-revolution inclined souls across various social networking sites.
It seems Dominque Strauss-Kahn who, as of last week, is now known as the former chief of the International Monetary Fund has gotten himself in trouble, again - I might add, to the joy of Nicholas Sarkozy (who has one less contender for the 2012 French election) and the dismay of the Europeans (who by tradition declare the IMF chief while America does the sister-institution, the World Bank).
But, this piece isn't to speculate his guilt (if it was indeed successful assault attempted rape) or innocence (if the activity was consensual). Instead it is to consider current socio-political issues shaping up in Nepal in light of an opinion piece penned by Jacob Tomsky for The New York Times, titled 'Behind Closed, Sequentially Numbered Doors' and published on May 22, 2011.
Tomsky, with his experience in the luxury hospitality business describes the ""difficult position"" that the 250,000 housekeepers in the United States frequently and unwillingly find themselves in. He details the predicament they often face - ""routinely accused by guests of stealing money from nightstands, making international calls from the room phones, rifling through luggage and pocketing jewelry"" - that is, in addition to sexual favors, requested or demanded as by Strauss-Kahn to one such 32-year old housekeeper from Guinea.
Tomsky's words read less like a piece about sexual harassment and more like a piece that reflects the plight of un-numbered kaam garnes that mark the middle-class urban household in Nepal.
My suspicion was further fueled as Tomsky ended his piece by applauding the advantages housekeepers in the Big Apple do enjoy, the grandest probably being membership in the New York Hotel Workers' Union.
I understand hotel cleaners and household help are two very different professions, but seeing the situation of female housekeepers in luxurious American hotels shed some light on the myriad of domestic workers that sweep, dust, mop and cook for the average urban family, it seemed only appropriate that we take a cue.
Truth is, we have little to zero data on the number and situation of household help. If we did collect more and that too, thorough data to stand as evidence, we would know that abuse is rampant and simultaneously underreported. Furthermore, that such abuse doest not start at sexual harassment.
No individual is less willing to be exploited than to exploit. For the middle class of us, those who rely on the help provided by others, it seems only fair that we give our helpers a proper deal - contract, minimum wage and holidays, to begin with. We don't need to wait for the constitution, we don't need to tweet about it, vent about a banda and we really don't need to wait for the Ministry of Labor to advocate it either.
According to 'A Study of the Domestic Labor in Nepal' (found over at domesticworkerrights.org), over 40 percent of household helpers in the three sample districts were between 10 and 14 in 2006. Whereas Tomsky was able to confidently claim the number of (documented) housekeepers across America, there is no such reliable data available in Nepal of our domestic workers. Without data, there is little wiggle room to address issues.
Stories as those recently published by Republica, 'Government Employee Rapes Domestic Help"" and 'Government Mulls Rescuing Domestic Child Workers,' both by Arjun Poudel, speak volumes regarding the abuse that domestic workers have to put up with.
Stories of overworked, underpaid helpers have yet to make headlines, probably because it is the norm and it contains no shock value.
As middle-class Kathmanduties with more exposure and education than generations prior, we hope more and more families that rely on assistance to run their household treat those assisting with dignity and respect.
And yet, precisely because abusing helpers is the norm and not the anomaly, the thought of a Domestic Workers' Union appeared every bit reasonable. It shouldn't take the household owner's decision to determine the parameters of the helpers' work and existence.
The demands of the Nepal Independent Domestic Workers Union (NIDWN) baffle the average urban-dweller: Contracts? Minimum wage? Medical assistance? Labor laws? Fixed working hours? Family visits? Holidays and transportation allowance?
The fact that these basics were termed as ""demands"" seemed absurd - it seems NIDWN only sought basic arrangements.

 The explosion occurred at a bridge in Bara district, about 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Kathmandu, the police said.
'They tried to defuse the bomb, but it went off before they were able to dispose it,' a police officer of the district said.
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, but police suspect it was planted by Maoist rebels waging an armed insurgency in the country.
 Also on Friday, suspected Maoist rebels torched three vehicles in Nawalparasi district in southern Nepal.
 The vehicles, bearing Indian license plates, were set ablaze on Mahendra Highway for defying a general strike called by the rebels in the district, local media reports said.
 There were no injuries in the fire.
 The Maoist rebels have been waging a bloody war since 1996 to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy and set up a one-party communist republic. More than 11,000 people have been killed in the nine years of fighting.

 In a written reply to the Supreme Court (SC), the government has reiterated that the Maoists are terrorists. The government has also made it clear that the ban imposed on the rebels is also due to the same reason, reports said.
 Arguing that the government has imposed a ban on the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), declaring them as terrorists, which is against the Article 12 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, Taranath Ghimire of Bhojpur had filed a writ petition at the apex court last month. Ghimire had demanded the removal of the terrorist tag and the ban imposed on the Maoists.

 ""The government can declare as terrorist any person, group or organization involved in any offence that is liable to punishment as per the Section 7 (2) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Act-2002, enacted by the legislative.

 Royal Nepali Army (RNA), for the first time, officially confirmed on Thursday 26 February that Matrika Yadav and Suresh Ale Magar, two top Maoist leaders caught in India, are now under the government's control.
 ""They (Yadav and Ale) are under the control of His Majesty's Government,"" RNA spokesman Col Deepak Gurung told a regular press meet on Thursday.

Gurung, however, declined to confirm whereabouts of the two rebel leaders. ""We cannot say where they have been kept for security reasons,"" he said.
 Yadav and Ale were arrested by Indian police in Lucknow and were extradited to Nepali authorities a few days ago. Yadav was the chairman of the newly formed ""Madhesi autonomous region"", while Ale belonged to the intellectual circle of the Maoists.
 According to media reports, troops have confined Yadav and Ale somewhere in an army camp in the mid-western region under foolproof security.
 Human rights organizations and, recently, Nepal Bar Association were critical of the government for not making whereabouts of the two Maoist leaders public.
 On RNA's role in the general elections which, according to the prime minister, will be held in October 2004, RNA spokesman Gurung said they are ""unaware"" of the matter.
 ""We have not received any official letter from the government with regard to the elections,"" he said.

The strike - which closed shops and schools, and left roads largely deserted - started Wednesday and was marked Thursday with three small bomb blasts in the capital Katmandu.
No one was wounded in the explosions, which police blamed on the insurgents.
In a statement, the rebels' student arm, the All Nepal National Free Student Union, said it was ending the strike because of pleas from the public. It did not comment on the students who defied the strike order and voted in the elections.
The student union opposed the college polls because it had been banned in taking part in them after being labeled a terrorist organization by the government.
Life quickly returning to normal in the city after the statement was released.
Every political party in Nepal has a student wing contesting the college elections, a key indicator of each parties' support. The polls are deemed second in importance to parliamentary elections.
When the rebels and their supporters issue strike calls demanding that people stay home, they usually are successful because residents are afraid to defy what they consider a ruthless militant group.
The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The eight-year insurgency has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
Fighting has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a cease-fire in August. The rebels walked out of peace talks and resumed attacks on government and civilian targets.

"4505",20066373,"Title: Nepal politicians under rebel pressure to take on monarch_analysts.rtf; Date: April 30, 2006 Sunday 4:01 AM GMT; Text: Powerful armed Maoist rebels have effectively given Nepal's legislators, swept back into office by ""people power,"" three months to take on the monarch, diplomats and analysts said.
Nepal's political parties were due Sunday to start thrashing out complex arrangements to trim the influence of King Gyanendra whose 14 months of absolute rule ended only after weeks of protests across the mountainous nation.
Legislators are entering a new and confused political era under pressure for instant results from the Maoists and a demanding public whose protests forced the king into his humbling climbdown.
Top of their demands were elections for a constitutent assembly to reframe the 1990 constitution that allowed Gyanendra to sack the government in February last year and assume total power.
The Maoist rebels -- who have fought a 10-year insurgency that has left more than 12,500 people dead -- called a three month ceasefire last week to ""motivate"" the political parties.
One academic estimated last week there were fewer than 10,000 active armed rebels in the country but the Maoists were able to mobilise large numbers of people to join anti-monarchy protests from territory under their control.
But with the king apparently unwilling to relinquish his powers easily, diplomats warned of months of wrangling ahead as legislators went back to work after a four-year hiatus.
The parliament was dissolved in a row over extending emergency powers to tackle the Maoist rebellion.
""By calling a ceasefire, they're saying: you've got three months, that's your deadline,"" said one diplomat.
""This isn't going to be a quick process. Whatever they do, they have to stop squabbling and deliver their promise of a constituent assembly. I do think Maoists are going to end up in government pretty soon,"" said the diplomat.
The Maoists would be able to sit back while political parties, with whom they have forged a loose alliance, moved Nepal closer to the rebels' goal of a republic and the end of 237 years of monarchy.
But if the politicians failed, they would be able to pick up on the anti-royal sentiment that featured strongly during three weeks of April protests with effigies of the king burnt and chants calling for his ouster.
""The people were not getting anything -- no peace, no money, no development,"" said P.G. Rajamohan, a research fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in New Delhi.
""People accepted the 1990 democracy which did not pay enough for them. That's why people have given their support to the Maoist movement,"" he said.
But another diplomat warned that the rebel forces, who remained armed despite their ceasefire call, could play a powerful role in any elections eventually called for a constituent assembly.
""Are we going to have elections for a constituent assembly with the Maoists sitting there with their guns on their knees? That's a pretty threatening proposition,"" said the diplomat.
Experts say Nepal is entering new territory as politicians try to call elections for the constitution forming body.
It is not allowed under the current constitution -- which could lead to legal challenges in the months ahead delaying any swift resolution of the issue, said analysts.
The king has remained out of the public eye since Monday when he announced that he was reforming parliament but did not mention a constituent assembly in two televised proclamations.
But in the event of proposals for radical trimming of his powers, the king could use his powers to delay bills, said political scientist Rabindra Khanal of Kathmandu's Tribhuwan University.
""Another confrontation is possible,"" he said. ""He might not want to give it up because they're asking the king for a republic and that means asking him to  go away.
""But I think now there is no hope for a constitutional monarchy. The major problem is the Maoists don't want to come down from the republic.""

[by Passang Norbu]  
7 June: A member of the Communist Party of Bhutan (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist) based in Nepal was killed while trying to plant a bomb near the Damchen petroleum depot at Kharbandi, Phuentsholing at around 2:15 am on 4 June.
According to police, the culprit, identified as Indra Bhadur Ghalley, was found dead 10 metres away from the blast site. ""He was killed while he was activating the explosive device, which went off,"" according to the police. Police said that the deceased absconded the country last year to join the party in Nepal.
A watchman at Kharbandi told Kuensel that the explosion was so loud that he threw his mobile phone from shock. ""When I went to inspect, some parts of the wall beside the road had been blown off and there was no-one,"" he said.
Earlier that night, a bomb which exploded near the Nainital primary school in Samtse at around 12:45 a.m. severely injured the man who tried to plant the bomb.
According to the watchman of the school, the culprit suffered deep cuts on his head and body. ""He was given water by people nearby who were alerted by the impact of the explosion,"" he said.

The Samtse police also recovered leaflets and banners of the party from Chandra Rai. Chandra Raj Rai told police that the Communist Party of Bhutan in Nepal sent him to carry out bomb blasts in Nainital village.
According to police, Chandra Raj Rai and Indra Bahadur Ghalley were involved in instigating and recruiting people in Ghumaoney geog [village group] in Samtse to join the Communist Party of Bhutan. ""They'd also given training to some people of Ghumaoney in the making and use of improvised explosives devices,"" said a police spokesperson.

But hopes that relief has arrived are soon dashed as the chopper, loaded with emergency supplies, turns away, its crew deciding for safety reasons against landing in driving rain.
""There is just nothing left to eat,"" said drenched farmer Ashish Thakur in submerged Kaanti village in Darbhanga district. 
""Even the relief helicopters are not landing anymore,"" he said.
""People are fighting for food like dogs, I have no strength left,"" the farmer wept, hugging his two hungry children and shivering wife.
Darbhanga is among the 14 worst-hit districts in the poverty-ridden state of Bihar where nearly seven million people have been struck by annual monsoon floods that have engulfed thousands of villages.
""We anticipated some floods and stored some food stocks but it was impossible for us to imagine in advance that it would be so bad,"" Darbhanga administrator Upendra Sharma told AFP.
Some 700 of Darbhanga's 1,200 villages are ""fully or partly submerged"" affecting around 2.1 million people, the official said in his headquarters in Darbangha district town, where foliage-laden muddy water was surging in.
The annual monsoon regularly brings flooding to the subcontinent but this year has seen some of the worst in recent times, claiming over 1,100 lives.
Relief teams in India, Bangladesh and Nepal are battling to bring food, clean drinking water and medicines to nearly 20 million people stranded across the region by the massive flooding. 
In India's Darbhanga district, the rains, far heavier than usual, have cut roads and rail lines, officials said.
""Compared to the 280 millimetres (11 inches) of rains we recorded during all of the last monsoon, we received 873 millimetres (34.3 inches) in July alone. It's raining non-stop,"" said Sharma.
""All links are down -- road, rail and air -- everything. Only telephones are working,"" he said.
Rising waters have shut down the area's main hospital and 45 girls have been stranded in their school in the district town for a week after swirling waters rose rapidly around their classrooms.
Villagers have been shouting moral support to them from a distance but, with no boat available, they have been unable to cross the waters to reach them, officials said.
The situation was also grim in the sleepy town of Leheriasarai.
""Every inch of our town is under water and food and milk have vanished from the market,"" said resident Dabloo Shankar.
""The authorities have vanished and there are no more helicopter relief sorties,"" said Prasan Kumar of nearby Shugoli village, staring at the rain-swollen clouds.
""We will soon be eating off the ground as we haven't had a single morsel to share among the five of us in the past four days,"" the man said of his family.
Administrator Sharma said he had set up 396 emergency kitchens to make food for marooned people but the effort was proving to be a drop in the ocean.
""We need help and very quickly,"" said a volunteer at a privately run relief agency supplying medicine to the district, where submerged graveyards also pose a looming health hazard.

 Kathmandu, 25 January: Five parliamentary parties said the student movement for a republic is just and constitutional and indicated their protest will be directed towards a republic from March.
 The political parties for the first time formally supported the on-going effective and spiralling student youth protest and said it was part of a peaceful joint popular movement.
 The five political parties said the movement will be stronger and more effective. While the government has accused the political parties for inciting the students towards unconstitutional activities, the parties backing constitutional monarchy have now formally backed the students.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 26 Jan 04
The parties decided to support protests of women, labourers, farmers, intellectuals and different professional organizations as well.
 Senior leaders who met in the capital Sunday 25 January agreed the assurances of the King in recent audiences could not be relied upon. They came to such a conclusion after sharing experiences at an all-party meeting following the parleys with the King.
 With commitment to constitutional monarchy, they agreed to take the movement to a decisive phase by mid-April.  passage omitted
 ""The slogans of the students are against autocracy,"" CPN-UML Communist Party of Nepal-(Unified Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said in response to queries by reporters who asked if political parties were inciting students.
 But Congress central committee member Krishna Sitaula said the movement launched by students questioning the relevance of monarchy was the second chapter of the fight against regression. He said: ""We hope the King will not force us to launch the third chapter of the movement."" He warned if the King becomes autocratic, the third chapter of the protest will move for a republic by declaring the end of monarchy.

Kantipur Television, Kathmandu, in Nepali 1315 gmt 4 May 04
Leaders who addressed the gathering today said their protests would continue so long as the sovereign rights of the people were not restored to them. They said, despite their commitment to parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch, the king had chosen to take away the people's sovereign rights and that this had forced the political parties to raise a finger at the king. The leaders also warned that if the king did not act swiftly in accordance with the wishes of the people, the institution of the crown would be confined to history books for future generations to read.
 The leaders also said that they had won a small war after the government withdrew its orders prohibiting assembly yesterday, but they said they had to strengthen their movement to win the bigger battle.
 Speaking at the mass meeting, President of the Nepali Congress Girija Prasad Koirala warned the king that they would move ahead if he did not restore the people's sovereign rights.
 Likewise, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Madhav Kumar Nepal, said the agitating party leaders would not go to the palace so long as Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa's government was in place.

The Maoist cadres led by one Bikal of the cantonment started beating youths at 10 in the night and also vandalized houses in the process.
""We were sleeping when a group of 25 to 30 persons smashed the door, took me out and thrashed me with the butt and barrel of guns and sticks,"" Suman Thamsohang, a local, said.
Man Bahadur Fago, Minshu Fago, Chandra Nugo, Chhabilal Limbu and Dipendra Tumbahamfey were released Tuesday afternoon with bruises all over the body 16 hours after they were taken to the cantonment two kilometers away from the village. The cantonment had called the members of the local Peace Committee to the west gate to receive the abducted persons but left them at the east gate. The five were taken to Damak, Jhapa for treatment immediately after release.
Jit Bahadur Limbu, who was badly injured in the beating, has been taken to Neuro Hospital Biratnagar, while Yogmaya Tumbahamfey claimed the Maoist cadres also looted her jewelry.
The Maoists vandalized the houses of the abducted five and Tara Fago, Mahasamiti member of Nepali Congress. ""They had come to our house at around midnight. We were spared as we were on the first floor but they vandalized the house and motorcycle,"" Tara Fago said. The Maoists carried out their atrocities despite the presence of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force in the village.
Locals claimed that the Maoists thrashed the villagers to avenge the attack on them during a wedding ceremony four days ago. ""We had chastised a combatant for misbehaving with a woman. A gang of 15 to 20 cadres had later returned to the village but we had fought them away,"" a local explained.
But the cantonment claimed that Dhruba Lawati, who had not been able to extract commission from a contractor doing graveling work inside the cantonment, had thrashed the combatants during the wedding. ""He had severely beaten up five other combatants who had gone for rescue as well.
The incident occurred after combatants went in search of Lawati and his supporters because the police didn't take any action despite a complaint,"" Pratiksha of the headquarters said and claimed that those taken to the cantonment were not beaten.
Combatants clash with locals while playing football
The combatants of Danabari satellite camp under the First Division had also clashed with locals of Danabari-9 over a game of football Monday. A combatant shoved a local player to the ground and trampled on his back after the local tackled him during the match.
""Around 30 to 40 combatants came from the camp and brutally thrashed four youths after locals entered the ground to intervene,"" a local said. Two of the four youths have been taken to Siliguri, India for further treatment.
The tournament organized for peace and bonhomie has been halted after he incident.
NC condemns Maoist attack on cadres
Nepali Congress (NC) has condemned the attacks on its cadres by the Maoist combatants cantoned in Ilam on Monday night.
In a press meet organized at the party head office in Sanepa, the party stated that around 60 armed Maoist combatants attacked NC cadres in Chulachuli VDC-1 at midnight on Monday.
""It is doubtful if the cantonments have really come under the Special Committee. It is the first, but serious crimes committed by the combatants after UNMIN's exit,"" said NC General Secretary Krishna Prasad Situala.
According to the party, the Maoist combatants beat up 12 party cadres severely before abducting them.
The Maoist combatants later released eight, but the whereabouts of four has yet to be established.
According to a statement issued by the party, one Suman Thamsuhang, who was severely beaten and left in the lurch, was rescued by security personnel.
NC party has asked the Maoists to immediately stop such criminal activities and ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

"733",20032321,"Title: Nepal sliding deeper into violence as Maoist clashes escalate.rtf; Date: November 4, 2003 Tuesday; Text: Nepal is sliding into a cycle of violence as Maoist rebels mount daily attacks against an army with increasing political influence and solid support from the West, analysts say.
The Himalayan kingdom has averaged more than 15 killings a day since the Maoists ended a seven-month ceasefire on August 27 and resumed their seven-year ""people's war"" to overthrow the monarchy, according to a Nepal-based human rights group.
After peace talks failed, the royal-appointed government set up the Unified Security Command which puts the army, whose supreme commander is King Gyanendra, firmly in charge of all counter-insurgency operations.
""Since a bulk of the national budget is consumed by security, the army and the police have to justify their expenses by putting forth an image of crushing the Maoists,"" said Kapil Shrestha, a political science professor in Kathmandu.
The army used to amount to a ceremonial force, with the police bearing the brunt of Maoist attacks, until Gyanendra deployed the troops after the rebels broke an earlier truce in November 2001.
The army has since modernized with assistance from Britain, India and the United States, including helicopters capable of night raids against the rebels, who run a virtual parallel state in rural areas.
Last week Washington offered a fresh boost to the embattled government, declaring the Maoists a threat to US national security and freezing any assets they may have in the United States.
""The army and police are under strong pressure from the government and public. The support of the United States and Britain boosts their morale. They feel they are superior to the rebels,"" Shrestha said.
Both sides have dropped any talk of resuming peace negotiations.
The Maoist leadership in a statement Sunday accused the United States of working against calls by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and others for resumed dialogue, but the rebels a week earlier said they would not restart talks because of the government's growing ""militarization.""
In Kathmandu, decision-making on the insurgency rests in the hands of the army and King Gyanendra, who has made crushing the rebellion a priority, analysts said.
The king dismissed the elected prime minister in October 2002 and appointed his own government. The five leading political parties have been protesting for months to demand new elections but to little avail.
Former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala, president of the largest democratic party the Nepali Congress, criticized the increased role of the army in fighting the Maoists.
""This is the first step toward military rule in Nepal,"" he said.
While the army and defense ministry do not release statistics on deployment, a security source said between 45,000 and 50,000 troops and police were spread across the kingdom.
A Maoist source said there were about 24,000 trained guerrillas organized under two divisions: in eastern Nepal under the command of Barsha Man Pun, whose alias is Ananta, and in the west headed by Nanada Kishore Pun, also known as Pasang.
Independent estimates have put the number of hardcore Maoists at no more than a few thousand.
The Informal Service Sector Center, a human rights group in Kathmandu, said more than 1,100 people have been killed in fighting since the end of the truce, with government forces responsible for about 70 percent of the deaths.
The Maoists announced October 22 they would no longer attack infrastructure, in what is viewed as an attempt to build public support. Clashes generally entail the Maoists attacking security posts or patrols or troops battling rebels in isolated areas.
""The Maoists have attacked projects and offices and police posts but have not been able to cause heavy damage to the army setup,"" political analyst Bhaktendra Dhoj Shah said.
But defense sources said the Maoists were plotting a more dramatic way to show their strength, such as simultaneous attacks on police or army positions.

 Kathmandu, Sunday 20 June: The president of the Nepali Congress, Girija Prasad Koirala, has made it clear he is not against a constituent assembly.
 At a meeting Sunday of the four political parties agitating against regression, Mr. Koirala said, he had no reservations against a new constitution through a constituent assembly. But, he was quoted by a source, as saying the political parties, the intellectual community and civil society should first be clear about the reason and purpose of a constituent assembly.
Annapurna Post, Kathmandu, in Nepali 21 Jun 04
It caused a stir some time back, among party activists and other parties supporting Mr. Koirala's Nepali Congress party when he said a constituent assembly would not be acceptable to him. The intellectual community and party activists involved in the agitation had urged him to rethink his position.
 Referring to the fact that the Nepali Congress had first demanded a constituent assembly, Mr. Koirala questioned whether or not the time was right for it now. He said he was sensitive to the fact that the country should not be left without a constitution at a time of crisis. According to a source Mr. Koirala also raised a question about what should be done with the arms in the possession of the Royal Nepal Army and those in the possession of the peoples' army of Prachandaq (Maoist leader). And he is also quoted as insisting that there should be national consensus on the monarchy.
 Replying to a question put by leaders of the agitating parties, the source said, Mr. Koirala also expressed the opinion that when the King and the Maoists were in possession of weapons, organizations like the UN should be brought in as election observers.
 passages omitted with comments of other leaders.
 The Nepali Congress spokesman, Arjun Narsingh KC said, the format of the movement, its demands and participants would soon change. According to Mr. KC the agitation centred in the capital would be more publicity centered beginning 29 June.

"7107",20082927,"Title: Nepal hit by strike as political tensions mount.rtf; Date: February 13, 2008 Wednesday 12:35 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's ethnically tense south was hit by an indefinite strike launched Wednesday, compounding a fuel shortage in the impoverished and landlocked nation's capital and fears for the peace process.
The strike in the Terai region is the latest protest action by the Mahadhesi minority, who are seeking greater autonomy for a region hit by a year of violence that has left at least 200 people dead.
""All transportation services have come to a halt and markets, schools remained shut today (Wednesday)"" Bhola Prasad Shivakoti, chief district officer from the southern town of Birgunj, told AFP.
The strike across the south has hit the capital hard, as the Terai is the only route to bring in petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene to the landlocked nation from sole supplier India.
Kathmandu was already facing an acute fuel shortage as tanker drivers in recent weeks have been refusing to drive through the Terai, an oil official said.
""Frequent protests and threats by various groups in the Terai have reduced the morale of the tanker drivers who are unwilling to take risks,"" Mukunda Prasad Dhungel, an official from the state-run Nepal Oil Corporation, told AFP.
""Unless the government improves the security situation in the southern plains we will not be able to get normal fuel supply into Kathmandu,"" he warned.
Chief district officer Shivakoti said Mahadhesi activists forced people to close their shops in Birgunj, 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Kathmandu, although he said that ""so far the situation has remained peaceful.""
Around two dozen armed ethnic groups have emerged in the Terai region since mainstream parties and former Maoist rebels signed a peace deal in November 2006 and formed an interim government that Mahadhesi activists say still excludes politicians from the lowlands.
Last weekend, three different groups representing the minority formed an alliance for what they called ""a final revolt"" against the country's government, which is itself riven by tensions ahead of national elections set for April 10.
Protests were reported elsewhere in the region bordering India, home to around half of Nepal's 27 million population and known as the country's bread basket.
Authorities in Kathmandu said they were ready for dialogue but warned any fresh violence would not be tolerated.
""The government is always ready for dialogue but we have not got any response from them,"" said state minister for home affairs Ram Kumar Chaudhary.
""We have made necessary arrangements to maintain law and order in the Terai region. If protesters turn violent, the state would not remain silent.""
But a Mahadhesi leader said a mere offer of talks was not enough.
""We are not against the talks with the government but we will only sit for meaningful talks,"" said Rajendra Mahato, leader of the Nepal Sadbhawana Party.
""The state must give clear views on guaranteeing a federal state structure with greater autonomy and the right to self-determination before we sit for talks.""

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora presented a certificate of commendation to officials from the Nepalese Embassy in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, according to a statement posted on the CITES Web site.
The award is in recognition of the Royal Nepalese Army's ""exemplary efforts to combat poaching and illegal trade in endangered species, in particular the leopard, the rhinoceros and the tiger,"" the CITES statement said.
The army shares the recognition with park rangers of the Royal Chitwan National Park in southern Nepal.
Park officials and army forces arrested more than 30 people in 2004 and 2005 for wildlife crimes, many of whom were subsequently jailed. They also seized rhinoceros horns, tiger skins, tiger and leopard bones, and confiscated illegal earnings, vehicles, weapons and ammunition.
""The poaching of animals such as tigers and rhinoceroses has brought some populations of these species to the brink of extinction. Many criminals involved in poaching do not hesitate to act violently towards law enforcement personnel, which makes the dangerous work performed by park staff and by the army in Nepal all the more impressive,"" CITES Secretary-General Willem Wijnstekers said.
Wijnstekers also commended Nepalese authorities for their commitment to protecting their country's biodiversity when law enforcement agencies face many other demands upon their time and resources.
Nepal's army began fighting communist insurgents in 2001. Since then fighting between the military and the rebels has killed more than 13,000.

Kathmandu, 9 September: The Maoist party has threatened to quit the government within a week if the government fails to meet its 22-point demands.
The party has said that it would launch a movement from 18 September if its demands including the declaration of republic to clear the way for the constituent assembly election were not met.
""We have proposed to strike a new agreement. If that does not happen, we will quit the government and prepare to launch the movement from 16 September,"" said Maoist leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai. The party has instructed the activists at all the regions, committees, fronts, sister organizations to join the movement that will intensify after quitting the government.
The Nepali Congress party lately decided to go for a republican set up but the Maoists have said that the model of the republic embraced by the Congress should be discussed. The Maoists have proposed that the republic should be declared by the special session of the parliament after all the major parties decide to go for a republic. All the alliance partners are being consulted regarding the new agreement, said Dr Bhattarai.
The Maoist party has been insisting that real constituent assembly elections would be held only after the declaration of republic.
At a time when the environment for constituent assembly elections was being created, the Maoists have not laid priority on the election. It puts forward its 22-point demands saying that the new agreement would be reached by mid-August. The demands of the Maoists include, besides the declaration of republic, a solution to the problems of the terai plains [southern plains], building agreement with all sides concerned, action against people guilty of killing Maoist workers in the terai and giving assistance to the families of the disappeared citizens and the people who were killed during the people's movement.
""There must be an agreement on the 22-point demands if the election of the constituent assembly election is to take place in the true sense. Otherwise, it will be just another election like the one conducted by the king during panchayat [local self-government] rule,"" said Dr Bhattarai.

"7790",20118048,"Title: Central team to diagnose mysterious disease in Bihar.rtf; Date: June 21, 2011 Tuesday; Text: Patna, June 21 -- Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that a central team of doctors would soon visit Muzaffarpur to diagnose the mysterious disease which has claimed the lives of over two dozen children.
Since the disease had not been identified yet he had requested the Union Health Ministry to send a team of doctors to take the necessary steps to combat the disease.
""And, thankfully the Union Health Minister has accepted my request and he is sending a team of doctors here,"" the Chief Minister informed, adding that unless the disease was diagnosed proper treatment could not begin.
""I've been told that the doctors are treating the affected children on symptoms only. So it's necessary to diagnose the disease first,"" he said.
However, the local doctors and people in Muzaffarpur said it was a case of suspected Japanese encephalitis which has claimed lives of at least 27 children in the last 10 days.
The State Government doctors have taken blood samples of the affected children to send them to Pune or Delhi for further test.
The Chief Minister also spoke of the controversy arising out of the Forbesganj police firing incident in which four people, including a seven month infant and a pregnant woman, were killed. When asked about the Opposition's continuous attack on the Government, Nitish Kumar said in a democratic set-up everyone was free to speak and criticise.
""In a democratic set-up everybody is free to speak what he deems fit, but the fact is that the State Government has already ordered a judicial probe into the incident which alone can unravel what happened and why it happened,"" Nitish Kumar added.
He further explained that the State Government had approached the Chief Justice of Patna High Court to appoint a sitting judge for the probe as the strength of the judges in the court had risen to 39.
""We should wait for the inquiry report that and we'll swiftly act on the basis of the report,"" he said, adding that he did not want to say anything that would influence the probe.
Meanwhile, the protesting Opposition parties have demanded a CBI inquiry into the incident which had shaken the State. A team of Forbesganj firing incident victims had also visited Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday demanding action against the guilty persons.
When asked about the rising water level in river Kosi on the India-Nepal border, the Chief Minister assured that the State Government was ""ready and alert and all precautionary measures have been taken following the reports of increase in the water level of Kosi river"".
Referring to his attempts aimed at getting the Centre to hold talks with Nepal for the excavation of a pilot channel to ease pressure on the river's eastern embankment, he said the two sides had agreed for the excavation of the 1.5 km channel but work was yet to begin as the official order had not yet reached the lower authorities in Nepal.
""I'm told by the Chief Secretary that the order given by the Nepal Government has not reached the local authorities there, so the work is yet to begin on this,"" rued Nitish Kumar.
However, when asked about his China visit, the Bihar Chief Minister said that it was informative in many ways but the he was amazed to see the roads of China.
""A powerpoint presentation of road construction in China has been brought for the road construction department here to see why such roads could not be constructed in Bihar,"" he said, while recounting the other progress made by China in the fields of tourism, agriculture, power plants and others.

"5620",2006933,"Title: Indian security hunt missing villagers after Maoist rebels kill 28.rtf; Date: March 1, 2006 Wednesday 3:15 PM GMT; Text: Indian security forces were hunting  for Maoist guerrillas who blew up 28 villagers and abducted around 100 others earlier in the week, police said Wednesday.
The Maoist attack came a day ahead of a three-day visit to India by US President George W. Bush for talks on strategic ties and countering terrorism.
The Maoists, known in India as Naxalites, used a landmine to explode a truck Tuesday in the central Indian state of Chattisgarh that was carrying people who had attended an anti-Maoist rally.
About 100 other people who at been at the rally and were travelling in other trucks were kidnapped and the vehicles torched, police said.
""Approximately 100 people are missing. Search operations have been launched to trace them,"" S.K. Paswan, state police inspector-general, told AFP.
India's Maoists, who have bases in a string of states, have recently stepped up attacks in their quest for enhanced economic and social rights for tribal people and landless farmers in rural areas.
State Home Minister Ram Vichar Netam said 40 people had also been seriously injured.
The victims had been attending rally organised as part of a state ""Public Campaign Against Naxalites"" launched last June to counteract Maoist violence.
Before the attack, Maoists had killed a total of 95 villagers for their involvement in the movement's peace marches and rallies, police say. Thousands of residents have been taking part in the demonstrations.
Meanwhile, the state's chief minister Raman Singh vowed to make the campaign against the Naxalites ""more aggressive"" and give it ""new direction"".
India's junior Home Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said Tuesday the national government was ready to send security reinforcements if Chattisgarh requested them.
Last month, rebels killed 19 security officials and over a dozen residents of Dantewada district where the Maoists have their training camps, police say.
The federal home ministry estimates 9,300 Maoist rebels operate in India. But security experts say the number is impossible to calculate as leftwing radicals hold sway across wide swathes of the largely-neglected rural areas.
The Maoists have been active in India since the 1960s. They have the same ideology as their counterparts in Nepal but say they have no operational links.

"1196",20031251,"Title: Third round of peace talks in Nepal opens.rtf; Date: August 17, 2003 Sunday; Text: A much-delayed third round of official peace talks between Nepal's government and Maoist rebels opened here Sunday, officials said.
Negotiating teams from both sides sat down together at a heavily guarded venue in the southwestern town of Nepalgunj, they said.
The army was patrolling the streets of Nepalgunj ahead of the negotiations, while banners hoping for the success of the talks were strung across many of the roads by civil groups and non-governmental organisations.
After a ceasefire was announced on January 29, talks were held on April 27 and May 9.
But the third session had been stalled partially due to disagreement over what, if anything, was agreed to in the previous rounds.
The Maoists last month threatened to suspend participation in the peace process, demanding that troops be restricted from moving more than five kilometers (three miles) outside their barracks -- which the rebels contend the government agreed to at the May 9 talks.
The government refused to budge on the troop restrictions, saying that soldiers only moved so far from their stations in exceptional circumstances.
It did, however, agree to release four senior Maoists from prison, prompting rebel supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- also known as Prachanda, or ""The Fierce"" -- to say the Maoists would take part in a third round.
Nepalgunj, on the Indian border about 420 kilometres (260 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, is the closest major town to the areas in the west of the kingdom under Maoist de facto rule.
The two previous sessions were held in Kathmandu and political observers said the symbolism of negotiating near the Maoists' home turf showed the rebels wanted this round of talks to lead to concrete action.
They are determined the talks will focus on political issues rather than procedural matters.

"7304",2011335,"Title: 'Rising' India still reluctant to lead_ analysts.rtf; Date: July 24, 2011 Sunday 2:22 AM GMT; Text: A US challenge to India to take a more assertive role on the global stage runs counter to a decades-old foreign policy that has nearly always valued diplomatic caution over strategic ambition.
Since independence in 1947, India has sporadically flexed its diplomatic, economic and military muscles, but such instances have been largely restricted to its immediate neighbours.
During her visit here last week, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was time for India to wield its growing economic and political clout further outside its borders and help ""shape the future"" of the Asia region and beyond.
""This is not a time when any of us can afford to look inward at the expense of looking outward,"" Clinton said. ""This is a time to lead.""
While there is suspicion of what is widely seen as a US strategic imperative for India to become a counter-weight to China, many experts agree the time has come for the world's largest democracy to make its voice heard more forcefully.
This is especially true, they argue, if India wants to prove its credentials for securing a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
""The 1991 economic reforms and the 1998 nuclear tests transformed India's place in the world. We must acknowledge that and speak out more often,"" said Lalit Mansingh, a former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to the United States.
All too often, India's voice is muffled by the initiative-dampening nature of its complex coalition politics and a long non-interventionist tradition that is proving hard to shed.
Mansingh cited India's lukewarm response to the pro-democracy movements that have convulsed the Arab world as an example of its preference for risk-averse diplomacy.
""I think India should have been much more welcoming of the Arab Spring,"" he said.
""The fight against dictatorship is very much in line with our democratic traditions, but we prefer to wait and watch. It is the Indian way,"" he added.
In a recent issue of Foreign Policy magazine, C. Raja Mohan, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, argued that while India was keen to ""increase its weight in global governance"" it would only do so on its own terms and at its own pace.
""The United States wants to test whether India is a responsible stakeholder in negotiations on issues ranging from climate change to international trade,"" Mohan said.
""India is prepared to engage on these issues and participate more fully in global decision-making bodies on the basis of its own self-interest, but is not prepared to take tests from anyone,"" he added.
Senior Indian civil servants remain fiercely protective of India's long-held policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, insisting that it is a better guarantor of influence in the long term.
""A passive approach is not necessarily a weak approach,"" said one senior official.
But the ""self-interest"" cited by Mohan is inevitably pushing India towards a more proactive stance, driven by the need to source raw materials for its energy-hungry economy and tap new consumers for its manufactured goods.
In both areas, it increasingly finds itself in competition with regional heavyweight China -- already a permanent UN Security Council member and an intimidating military and economic power.
China is mineral-rich Africa's top trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling $126.9 billion last year, and has extended its influence into India's immediate neighbourhood, notably in Sri Lanka and Nepal.
""India has already ceded a lot of ground in Africa to China,"" said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, vice dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs, who stressed the need to invest more energy in building relationships, whether in Africa, Latin America, or Asia.
""India must realise that economic growth at home is not enough to win you influence. Furthermore, with a slowdown in Europe and the US, it needs to think about where its markets will come from in the future,"" he said.
As for Clinton's appeal, which was for a more general leadership on issues like human rights and the environment, Chaulia voiced frustration with India's traditional wait-and-watch mindset.
""India can and should be more willing to make its presence felt on issues that matter,"" he said.
""We need to contest the orthodoxy that says, 'do as little as possible'"".

"7713",20112252,"Title: India , Israel _exploiting_ war on terror for common interests - Pakistan article.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: January 4, 2011 Tuesday
Text of article by Sajjad Shaukat headlined ""Exploiters of war on terror"" published by Pakistani newspaper Pakistan Observer website on 4 January
Since 9/11, by availing that golden opportunity, both India and Israel have continuously been exploiting the world phenomena of terrorism and anti-Muslim approach of the West in order to obtain their nefarious designs. While taking cognizance of the growing threat of global terrorism, which has been dividing the Western and Islamic nations on cultural and religious lines, American and European governments have already started inter-faith dialogue, especially between the Christian and the Muslim nations.
In the recent past, many conferences were held in various countries in which scholars from Islamic states also participated with a view to creating cultural understanding among major religious communities. In this regard, a four-day conference of Muslim and Christian intellectuals was also held at the Yale University, Divinity School of America for promoting interfaith dialogue, but ended without discussing any issue of religious fundamentalism in connection with state terrorism. Another conference of Muslims, Christians and Jews was held in at Madrid, arranged by the efforts of Saudi King Abdullah. However, all these measures are proving fruitless due to a deliberate anti-Muslim campaign, launched by the India-Israel lobbies, creating obstacles in global cultural cooperation. America and its allies have continued to kill many innocent civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir and Palestine through heavy aerial bombardment and ground shelling in the name of war on terror. Particularly by manipulating the global war against terrorism, occupying forces of India and Israel have been using every possible technique of state terrorism in the controlled territories which have become the breeding grounds of a prolonged interaction between freedom fighters and state terrorists, thwarting global cultural unity.
It is mentionable that like Palestinian ""Intifada"", the current phase of Kashmiri uprising began on 12 August 2008 when Indian forces killed Hurriyat Conference leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz, who was protesting against the Indian government's decision to give land to the trust that runs Amarnath, a shrine of Hindus. While extremist Hindus favoured the decision, but due to its revocation, started protests and economic blockade of the Muslims, emulating the Israeli siege of Gaza which had resulted in starvation of many a Palestinians. However, under the puppet regime in the India-held [Indian-administered] Kashmir, Indian brutalities are equal to those of Israel. In this respect, daily humiliations of the Kashmiris and Palestinians are a consistent feature of the India-Israeli intransigence. Nevertheless, Indian and Israeli forces have intermittently been employing military terrorism, such as curfews, crackdowns, sieges, massacre, targeted killings etc. to maintain their alien rule, while Indian troops also continue to kill Kashmiri people through fake encounters.
Another regrettable point is that irresponsible attitude of Indian, Israeli and some Western politicians has introduced dangerous socio-religious dimension in their societies by equating the ""war on terror"" with ""war on Islam"" and acts of Al-Qa'idah with all the Muslims. Their media have also been contributing to heighten the currents of world politics on cultural and religious lines with the negative projection of Islam. In this connection, reprinting of the caricatures about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and release of a Dutch film against the Holy Koran in the recent past might be noted as an example. It is because of these developments that a greater resentment is being found among the Muslims, who think that the US in connivance with the India-Israeli lobbies is sponsoring state terrorism, directly or indirectly from Kashmir to Palestine.
It is notable that India-Israel lobbies, which are working in the US and other western countries, have become proactive to exploit the war on terror against the legitimate interests of the Islamic world. [Sentence omitted] Besides, both India and Israel, which had openly jumped on Bush's anti-terrorism enterprise after the 11 September, are acting upon a secret diplomacy targeting Pakistan, China, Iran in particular and other Islamic countries in general. [Passage omitted]
In fact, by manipulating the world phenomena of terrorism and anti-Muslim approach of the West, both India and Israel have also been availing this opportunity to achieve their covert goals by convincing the US-led European states that a ""nuclearized"" Pakistan is sponsoring cross-border terrorism in Afghanistan and Kashmir. And Iran and Syria are doing the same act in Iraq, Lebanon and Israel. In this regard, equation of the ""war of liberation"" in Kashmir and Palestine with terrorism and use of delaying tactics in the solution of these controlled territories have become the main purpos"
"3906",2005614,"Title: 37 killed as Nepal bus hits landmine.rtf; Date: June 6, 2005 Monday 12:10 PM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, India, June 6 -- AT LEAST 37 passengers were killed when their bus ran over a landmine close to the Indian border, about 200 kilometres south of Kathmandu, on Monday. Initial reports, however, put the death toll at 53.
  Nepal's royal regime as well mainline parties blamed the Communist rebels for the biggest-ever attack on civilians that took place near Bharatpur, the native place of underground Maoist chief Pushpakamal Dahal. However, the Maoists have not so far claimed responsibility for it.
  Bharatpur is located in Maoist-infested Chitwan district that connects Kathmandu with the Nepalese lowlands and India.
  In the evening, a home ministry official said, "" So far, thirty-seven people have died in the incident."" The bus carrying about 90 passengers hit the landmine while it was going to Bharatpur from Ayodhyapur-Bagai around 8 am. Helicopters were used for rescue work. Reports said at least three security personnel were among the dead.

"4459",20067046,"Title: Trickle of voters as Nepal holds controversial poll.rtf; Date: February 8, 2006 Wednesday 4:11 AM GMT; Text: Voters trickled into polling booths across Nepal on Wednesday amid tight security as local elections touted by the king as the first step back to democracy got under way, witnesses said.
Few people were seen at voting stations in the capital Kathmandu, where heavily armed police and soldiers patrolled the streets as a rebel-called general strike entered its fourth day, an AFP correspondent said.
Maoist rebels and opposition parties have urged a boycott of the vote, called by King Gyanendra as part of his ""road map to democracy"" after he sacked the elected government and seized absolute power just over a year ago.
Newspapers reported that security agencies had been given the green light to shoot people disrupting the polls.
In Kathmandu's historic Durbar Square, voting booths were open but only five people had turned up in the first half hour of polling.
""I came here because it's a good thing for democracy,"" said the first to vote, Makahan Gallaa, who arrived with her husband.
Armed police wandered through the empty voter lines while election officials attributed the poor early turnout to lethargy.
""People are free to come whenever they like, many are lazy and they don't care about the time. Polls will close at 5:00 pm here,"" said an electoral official who asked not to be named.
""People are not afraid to come because there is a lot of security in Kathmandu but we don't know how many people will come. We hope things will run smoothly,"" said another election worker, Narendra Sinh Dhanderi.
Maoist leader Prachanda, whose call for a week-long general strike from Sunday has seen Nepal grind to a near halt, late Tuesday again urged people not to vote.
""Our party would like to make a final and special appeal to the general public ... to boycott the municipal polls and take the movement for democracy and peace to a new height,"" Prachanda said in a statement.
The struggle to topple the monarchy would continue and intensify after the polls, he said.
""We don't see any possibility of achieving democracy and peace as per the aspiration of Nepal and Nepalese people without resorting to decisive struggle against (the) feudalistic autocratic regime,"" he said.
More than half the 4,146 seats have no candidates, and in 22 of Nepal's 58 municipalities people have been appointed ahead of voting because of a lack of candidates. Wednesday's polling was taking place in only 36 municipalities.
The rebels are believed to have killed two candidates, thrown bombs at others and killed a strike-breaking taxi driver in an effort to reinforce their anti-poll message.
Home Minister Kamal Thapa urged the almost two million people on the electoral register to come out to vote.
""The government has completed all the procedures and enough security arrangements have been made to conduct the elections in a peaceful and fair manner,"" he told journalists late Tuesday.
Security forces will take ""strict action"" against anybody who tried to disrupt the polls or prevent people voting, Thapa said.
Critics see the elections as a way for Gyanendra to bring in local politicians who would then stand in national elections that the king has said will be held sometime before April 2007. 
The king says the road map will be adhered to and has appealed to political parties to take part in the polls and reconcile with the government.
In pre-election violence, five Maoists were killed on Monday and Tuesday in a series of clashes with security forces, the army said as polls got under way.

"4248",2005859,"Title: French alpine team needs help to recover bodies from Nepal avalanche.rtf; Date: October 27, 2005 Thursday 2:29 PM GMT; Text: A specialised French alpine team will mobilize more help including sniffer dogs to search for bodies of a French-led trekking team hit by a massive avalanche in Nepal last week, team members said Thursday.
""Two more French rescue experts are reaching Kathmandu on Friday who will take sniffer dogs trained for mountain rescue and special equipment to trace the bodies buried under tons of snow,"" French mountaineer and alpine expert Serge Koenig told reporters in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.
Seven French and 11 Nepali climbers, all part of an expedition attempting to summit the 6,981-metre (22,987-foot) Mount Kangaru, were hit by the avalanche at a base camp located at 5,000 metres on October 20.
Koenig and fellow team member Yves Martine said they believe all 18 were killed, although only one body was found, but that search and recovery efforts were difficult because of the terrain and ten-metre-thick (33-foot) snow.
""If mountaineers trapped in the avalanche are not rescued within 15 minutes, there is a rare chance of their survival,"" Martine said.
The team returned to Kathmandu Thursday to load up on supplies and would go back to the site in two or three days to renew search operations, Martine said.
Tourism ministry spokesman Sharada Prasad Trital said the body found Wednesday was identified as that of French climber Bruno Chardin.
Himalayan Rescue Association officials had said the body was that of Marie Odile Stolzenberg, wife of team leader Daniel Stolzenberg, but later admitted there had been a ""miscommunication"" from the rescuers in their radio relay from the mountainside.
The body was flown into Kathmandu from the mountain late Wednesday, he said.
The other French climbers were listed by Nepal's tourism ministry as Gregory Flematti, Bernard Constantin, Jean-Francois Jube and Jean-Paul Minette.
Koenig said the alpine team had tried to understand the path and force of the avalanche since arriving at the scene, as well as the sequence of events that led the climbers to camp at 5,000 metres on the night the avalanche hit.
""On the night between October 18 and 19 the weather deteriorated, which might have forced them to descend to the base camp instead of advancing to the summit of Mount Kangaru,"" he said.
""Three Nepalese Sherpa porters taking shelter a little bit down from the base camp were hit by the avalanche which swept them down several metres,"" he said.
""With the conditions described by them, it seemed the avalanche was very huge and it was very powerful to push everybody at the base camp down to the deep gorge between 50 to 100 metres down.""
Climbers use a narrow window between the end of the monsoon rains in September and the onset of winter to scale mountains in Nepal, which has eight of the world's highest peaks including the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) Mount Everest.

Dev Gurung, minister of Local Development, said the four Maoist ministers within the Cabinet led by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala all resigned after last-ditch negotiations with the alliance of seven other parties in the government broke down.
The former rebels, who entered the government after a peace deal last year ended fighting that had claimed more than 13,000 lives, had been demanding the current parliament declare Nepal a republic and sever all ties with King Gyanendra.
Earlier, the Maoists had agreed to wait for a new constituent assembly to be elected to decide the fate of the king, who has already been stripped of many of powers.

A general strike called by the United Democratic Mahadhesi Front (UDMF) has been dragging on for ten days, with at least two protesters killed and scores injured and arrested amid police efforts to reopen a key road.
Ethnic Mahadhesis from the impoverished Terai region want more of a say in how the country is governed, and have blocked the main road from the Indian border to Kathmandu -- the corridor for most of Nepal's imports.
""Their six demands are genuine and we are discussing them. We hope we can reach an understanding,"" government negotiator Mahesh Acharya told AFP.
The demands include compensation for anyone injured or killed in protests, the release of anyone arrested and an end to ""excessive force on protesters.""
The UDMF, which says it represents around half of Nepal's 27 million population, also wants the government to commit to discussing wider political issues.
In Nepal, hill-origin elites dominate local and national government as well as the security forces.
The European Union and United Nations have warned that the unrest threatens crucial polls planned for April that will decide Nepal's political future and most likely formally abolish the world's last Hindu monarchy.
""The constituent assembly polls are for everyone and we want all parties to take part,"" said government negotiator Acharya, who is from Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's Nepali Congress party.
The polls are a central plank of the landmark peace deal reached in late 2006 between Nepal's ex-rebel Maoists and mainstream parties.
The UDMF missed a deadline for registering candidates earlier this week, but the government told the election commission to extend the deadline until Sunday in the hope that a deal to end the UDMF strike can be reached.
Nepal's official human rights body also appealed to both sides to calm down.
""The government has used excessive force in many instances and the protestors have also gone overboard and lost patience,"" said Gauri Pradhan, the spokesman of the National Human Rights Commission.

It was the largest demonstration in 11 straight days of protests against King Gyanendra's direct rule over this Himalayan kingdom.
Protesters waived the flags of the political parties taking part in the march and chanted anti-government slogans.
Some 200 people were arrested and at least 20 people reportedly injured as police broke up the rally in Ranta Park - an area in the city that authorities have declared off-limits to protests.
Opposition parties said they were undeterred by the use of force and vowed to press ahead with their campaign to restore democracy in Nepal, pledging to stage demonstrations throughout the kingdom.
""So far the protest has been concentrated in the capital. But we have now decided to spread the protests to other parts of the country,"" said Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress, the largest political party in Nepal.
The Nepali Congress heads an alliance of seven main political parties demanding the king hand power back to an elected government.
Activists have been holding daily rallies in Katmandu since Sept. 4 to protest Gyanendra's seizure of power on Feb. 1 - a move the king said he made to end corruption and quell a communist insurgency that has claimed nearly 12,000 lives in nine years.
On Tuesday, police detained 529 pro-democracy protesters. Most were released by Wednesday morning, police said.
The king has said he assumed absolute power to end government corruption and to quell an anti-monarchist communist insurgency, which has claimed more than 11,500 lives in nine years.
Police have in recent days used water cannons, tear gas and bamboo batons to break up protests. But thousands have kept taking to the streets.
""More and more people are turning against the royal regime and supporting us,"" Sitaula said.
While the protests are growing, demonstrations have been common since the king seized power, and his rule does not appear seriously threatened.
But the opposition parties said their protests had kept him from attending the U.N. summit of world leaders. The royal palace has not said why the king's trip was canceled.
Meanwhile, the king and queen spent Wednesday touring southeastern Nepal by helicopter. State-run Nepal Television showed the royal couple waving at thousands of people who had gathered to meet him in the town of Jamkarpur.
Also Wednesday, communist rebels freed 60 Nepali soldiers held captive since last month, a human rights group said.
The soldiers, taken hostage Aug. 7, were handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross at a remote mountainous village of Lamidada, about 250 miles west of Katmandu. The Red Cross officials had flown to the area earlier this week to negotiate their release.

While discussing a bill on nationalization of assets of the dead king and his family, Sitaula said King Gyanendra transferred a bank balance of 137,427 pounds from Standard Chartered Bank in Nepal belonging to the murdered Queen Aishwarya, dead Crown Prince Dipendra and late Prince Nirajan to the Department of Treasury at the royal palace after the killings.
King Birendra and his family were among nine royals killed in a shootout at the royal palace by Crown Prince Dipendra on June 1, 2001.
Gyanendra became king June 4, 2001, after Dipendra, who is believed to have shot himself after killing the others, died in hospital.
According to the home minister, King Gyanendra transferred the funds to the palace treasury on Aug. 17, 2001 and he later transferred 108,854 pounds to an account in London.
Sitaula heads a ministerial committee formed in August to nationalize assets inherited by King Gyanendra from his elder brother's family.
The government has already nationalized fixed assets inherited by King Gyanendra from the dead king's family, following a parliamentary decision.
The nationalized property includes thousands of hectares of land and 16 palaces spread across the Himalayan nation.
The property has been brought under a trust, according to Sitaula.
King Gyanendra, a former businessman, became extremely unpopular after he used the military to stage a bloodless coup on Feb. 1, 2005, stating that the political parties had failed to quell the Maoist insurgency that started in 1996.
He relinquished executive authority after weeks of peaceful protests led by Nepal's mainstream parties and backed by Maoists in April last year.
The Maoists are now part of a peace process that started in November last year.

"4745",20063579,"Title: Prayers for Nepal 's missing 'Buddha Boy'.rtf; Date: March 14, 2006 Tuesday 3:43 AM GMT; Text: In the remote jungle of southern Nepal Buddhist monks in burgundy-coloured robes and Hindu priests pray together for the safe return of Nepal's missing ""Buddha Boy"".
Thought to be the birth place of Buddha, the source of Hinduism's holiest river, and ruled by a king who is believed by many to be a descendant of the Hindu god Vishnu, Nepal is a country that takes religion seriously.
So it was not surprising that people began flocking to Bara, 150 kilometres (95 miles) southeast of Kathmandu, to pay homage to a 16-year-old sage, when it was heard he had been meditating non-stop for months, without food and water.
But Ram Bahadur Bomjan, dubbed ""Buddha Boy"" by the media, vanished from his meditation site, nestled in the roots of a pipal tree, in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Media reported that he had been glimpsed in the surrounding jungle on Saturday, but since then there was no clue to his whereabouts more than 48 hours later.
""Over 1,000 people were involved in the search for Bomjan since Saturday but all came back to the meditation site empty handed,"" local journalist Shankar Acharya told AFP on Monday.
Bomjan started his meditation on May 16 last year, and supporters claim that he has taken neither food nor water or used the toilet since then.
As well as the seemingly impossible feat of nearly 10 months continuous meditation, supporters claim that a few weeks ago the boy burst into flames, but emerged from the fire unscathed.
Thousands of devotees have visited the site, to catch a glimpse of the boy being touted by followers as a reincarnation of Buddha.
Media here reported that Bomjan had told a friend that he was not a Buddha, but merely an ""austere sage.""
Visitors were kept at least 15 metres (50 feet) from the boy, and he was hidden from view at night be a screen, prompting some to label the claims a hoax.
Around 15 square kilometres of jungle have been combed by locals and police, but authorities have scaled back their search, said local police inspector Ram Kamal Acharya.
""There is no point in searching the same jungle again and again,"" Acharya told AFP on Monday.
Over the weekend, the police officer had said that he was 90 percent sure that Bomjan had left the site of his own accord, and had not been abducted as initial reports speculated.
Bed Bahadur Thing, the chairman of the committee set up to manage the site and look after Bomjan, said that the disturbance caused by thousands of devotees probably prompted the boy to abandon his quest.
""He may have shifted due to noise and pollution at the meditation site,"" Thing said.
Gautama Siddhartha, who later became known as Buddha or the Enlightened One, is believed to have been born in the same region near the border with India in around 500 BC.
Buddhists believe that Siddhartha achieved enlightenment after meditating under a pipal tree, and 20-year-old student Gaurab Tiwari believes that Bomjan's disappearance has parallels with the life of the founder of Buddhism.
""Even the original Buddha used to change places for meditation so he might have gone to find a new place because he was not satisfied in Bara,"" Tiwari said.
Thing has other ideas about the baby Buddha missing in the jungle.
""It is impossible to find him,"" he said. ""How can humans search for god?""

It said a group of guerrillas opened fire at a security force patrol in the town of Diktel, in Khotang district, 105 kilometres (65 miles) east of Kathmandu.
""There was no casualty on the security force side,"" it said, but two rebels were killed when the security force personnel returned fire.
Elsewhere, rebels torched a four-wheel drive vehicle owned by Madhav Kumar Nepal, leader of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist-Leninist, the radio said.
A bomb went off inside the Agriculture Development Office, in Nuwakot district, northwest of Kathmandu, causing damage to the office building, said the Nepali-language evening daily Sandhyakalin. No one was injured.
The rebels also set fire to the house of National Democratic Party central member Pratibha Rana in midwestern Nepal's Bardiya District on Wednesday morning, the newspaper said.
But the Maoists did release the chairman of a left-wing student union after hundreds of students protested against his abduction, student sources said Wednesday.
Hundreds of students protested in Kathmandu Monday demanding that the rebels free All Nepal National Free Students' Union (ANNFSU) chairman Rajendra Kumar Rai, whom they had kidnapped on Friday.
ANNFSU is affiliated to the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) political party.
The Maoists have not said why they abducted Rai, but they have in the past kidnapped people connected with rival parties.
Violence has surged in Nepal since an eight-day ceasefire, called by the rebels called to mark the Hindu kingdom's most important festival Dasain, ended Thursday.
Since the end of the temporary truce 136 people have been reported killed, dashing hopes that the peaceful holiday would restart efforts to find a political solution to the seven-and-a-half-year insurrection.
The Maoists held three rounds of peace talks with the government this year but walked out of negotiations after Kathmandu refused rebel demands to call a special assembly to redraft the constitution.
The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy since 1996 in an uprising that has claimed more than 8,200 lives, according to government figures.

"4770",20065722,"Title: Nepal opposition, rebels vows tougher action, government says militants among protesters.rtf; Date: April 9, 2006 Sunday 5:47 PM GMT; Text: Nepal's opposition parties vowed Sunday to continue a nationwide general strike and anti-monarchy protests indefinitely, as the government accused Maoist militants of infiltrating the demonstrations and shooting at police.
Police, with orders to shoot on sight anyone violating a virtual round-the-clock curfew, meanwhile fired rubber bullets and tear gas during clashes with protesters in the capital, Katmandu. Three people have been shot dead by police at rallies in other towns.
The demonstrations are part of a four-day strike called by Nepal's seven main political parties to demand that King Gyanendra who seized power last year step down and restore democracy. The strike, taking place for the first time with the support of armed communist rebels, was originally set to end Sunday.
But opposition representatives declared in a statement Sunday that, ""The nationwide general strike and protests will continue until further notice.""
Within hours, the rebels expressed their support for the extended opposition campaign.
In a statement e-mailed from an account regularly used by the rebels and signed by rebel Prachanda and his deputy Baburam Bhattarai, the communists also said they were launching a separate campaign against the king's rule. They will defy curfew orders, capture highways, break royal statues and punish anyone who pays taxes to the royal government, the statement said.
The government has justified its crackdown on the protesters by saying it had intelligence partly based on the interrogation of arrested militants that the rebels were infiltrating the rallies and planned to wage attacks on government targets.
Home Minister Kamal Thapa told a news conference in Katmandu that those fears had proved correct: police had arrested among the hundreds of protesters four men, who have previously been identified as Maoist rebels and were wanted by police.
He also alleged that militants pretending to be pro-democracy protesters had shot at security forces, but did not say if anyone was hurt.
Rebel chief Prachanda earlier promised that the rebels would not carry out attacks in Katmandu during the general strike.
""The terrorists have fired despite their pledge not to carry out violence in the capital,"" Thapa said. He said ""the security forces have recovered cartridges at Gangabu"" neighborhood on the northwest edge of Katmandu where a curfew was not imposed but several protests have been reported.
Witnesses and Nepali media meanwhile reported protests in dozens of other towns and cities.
Police fired tear gas at stone-throwing youths as at least 1,000 people assembled in Katmandu. Kantipur Television showed police shooting rubber-coated bullets, hitting at least one protester.
The government has arrested more than 800 people since Wednesday, including rights activists.
More than 2,000 people rallied in the southern town Bharatpur, angered by the death of a demonstrator shot by security forces a day earlier. On Saturday, roughly 25,000 protesters gathered and some set fire to government buildings in the town, which lies 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Katmandu.
A second protester was fatally shot Saturday in Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Katmandu. A third died when security forces opened fire on demonstrators in Banepa, 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of Katmandu, where a large crowd of protesters was shouting slogans and hurling stones at security forces.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Mao Zedong, began their campaign to make Nepal a communist state in 1996. Some 13,000 people have died since the fighting began.
The opposition parties and rebels formed a loose alliance in December to campaign for the king to step down and restore democracy.
Saturday was the 16th anniversary of the introduction of democracy in Nepal, an experiment that collapsed last year when Gyanendra took control of the government, vowing to crush the Maoist rebellion and hold elections within three years.
Many Nepalis at first welcomed the king's move, but the insurgency has since worsened and the economy has faltered, fueling nationwide discontent.
The crackdown on the opposition has prompted condemnations from the United States, Japan, the European Union and neighboring India, all of which have been critical of the king's seizure of power.

The blast on Sunday near the village Daya, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the Katmandu, also left one soldier critically injured, the Kantipur newspaper reported.
The patrol tried to retreat to safety, and was hit by another buried explosive that injured five more soldiers, the report said.
Because of government censorship, local newspapers are only allowed to cite government sources while reporting on the communist insurgency.
The attack could not be confirmed by independent sources. Officials in Katmandu told The Associated Press they were not aware of the incident.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, declared a unilateral cease-fire in September intended to allow for a resumption of peace talks with the government.
The government has refused to negotiate, saying the guerrillas must first give up violence and lay down their weapons.
Rebel violence in Nepal has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government in February. He said the measure was necessary to quell the communist insurgency, which has killed about 12,000 people since 1996.
Meanwhile, the Royal Nepalese Army in a statement said it had arrested three soldiers on charges of extorting money from civilians.
The statement said the soldiers were found threatening the local people around their camp at Jhapa, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of Katmandu, and taking money from them.
An investigation is being conducted and they would be punished severely if found guilty, the statement said without elaborating.
The army has been under pressure from rights groups both in Nepal and abroad to improve its human rights record.

One bomb, hidden behind fruit and vegetable carts, exploded at a busy market in Birgunj city in southern Nepal, wounding 12 people, police said. The city is a key transportation hub near the Indian border 100 miles south of the capital, Katmandu.
Police Chief Yogeswor Romkhani said by telephone there were no suspects and no one had claimed responsibility.
Earlier, an attacker on a motorcycle threw a bomb near the site of an election rally in Katmandu, hurting at least one person but not causing any major damage, said Home Ministry spokesman Ekmani Nepal.
The attack came minutes after a rally was held in the area by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a small group that is contesting Thursday's election for a Constituent Assembly that will decide the Himalayan nation's political future.
Police official Mahendra Bhattachand said police were searching for the attacker and no one had claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the third bombing in the capital in four days.
Some 17.6 million people are eligible to vote in Thursday's election to choose the assembly, which will rewrite the constitution and decide key issues for Nepal's future political system.
The election is also the first since communist rebels quit their armed struggled against Nepal's government and joined the political mainstream in a process that began in 2006.
Voters will elect members of the assembly, which besides rewriting the constitution, will decide key issues for Nepal's future political system, such as the level of power granted to the prime minister.
The election is an important part of a peace process under which communist rebels gave up their 10-year revolt against the government in 2006.
The country's major political parties have already decided that Nepal's centuries-old monarchy will be abolished after the election.
Nepal's King Gyanendra seized absolute power in 2005 but was forced to give up his authoritarian rule in 2006 after weeks of pro-democracy protests. He has since lost all his powers and his command of the army.
Nepali Congress, the largest political party in Nepal, organized political rallies and meetings Monday in all the constituencies.
""We have public rallies in all the districts on the last day of campaigning to try to persuade the voters to choose us,"" senior party member Shobhakar Parajuli said.
Their main competitor, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), the former communist rebels, were sending small groups of campaigners from house to house.
""Our plan has been to reach as many doorsteps as possible,"" senior Maoist leader Basanta Man Pun said.
Nepal's election law requires all campaigning to stop two days before an election, though it has been common in the past for parties to defy the law.
The Election Commission announced plans to strictly enforce the ban starting at midnight Monday, barring even newspapers from publishing opinion pieces on the polls.
Security has been stepped up, with thousands of police officers fanning out across the country, the Home Ministry said. The government has hired helicopters to patrol mountainous areas and fly police to trouble spots.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and other international election monitors were to arrive in Katmandu later Monday to observe the voting.

"7489",20111118,"Title: The lover and the beloved - A journey into Tantra_ A documentary featured on PU research scholar.rtf; Date: November 17, 2011 Thursday; Text: CHANDIGARH: An interesting research work on unravelling secrets of tantra and Nath Jogis, the oldest sect of ascetics in India, being conducted at Panjab University's department of history, has grabbed the attention of researchers overseas.
A 70-minute documentary, ""The lover and the beloved - A journey into Tantra,"" produced by the Media Centre of The University of Manchester, UK has been featured on a PU research scholar of Indo-Canadian origin, Rajive Paul McMullen. The film has been directed by Andy Lawrence, who teaches filmmaking in the social anthropology department of the university of Manchester.
From capturing McMullen's visits to the cremation grounds to the time spent with Aghori sadhus, known for their cannibalistic rites, the documentary summarizes Rajive's 15-year-old journey across the Himalayas to Nepal, Haridwar, Banaras and Gujarat, discovering ‘deeper meaning of rituals' followed by Indian Sadhus.
""The documentary breaks the myth associated with tantra in urban India, which is often mistaken to be black magic or has negative connotations associated to it. I have become a participant observer in my PhD and have been staying with Nath Jogis and several other sects of saints in India,"" said Rajive, who enrolled for his PhD on ""Aesthetic tradition of North India with reference to Nath Yogis"" under his guide Surinder Sharma at PU's history department in 2010.
Born in Mussoorie, McMullen parents, Dr C O McMullen and Catherine McMullen are both settled in Canada, while he has been travelling in India since he completed his masters in History from University of Toronto, Canada, eight years ago.
""The documentary is all about the spiritual quest of a person, who discovers the thin line that separates life from death. It is an attempt to encourage Indians to find deeper meaning in their traditions instead of dreading them,"" said Rajive, who was a former head of department of history at Baring Union Christian College, Batala.
""Rajive is deeply involved with the topic and has done a great job. He has gained a lot of field experience, which adds value to his research. It's a moment of pride for the department,"" said Rajiv Lochan, chairperson of the department of History, PU.
The documentary will be screened at PU's English auditorium from 3pm on Thursday.

 Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times website on 11 August
 Ilam, 11 August: The private schools in Ilam [far east Nepal], which had remained closed for the last three months following Maoist threats, will reopen from today at the initiation of the civil society. Realising the difficulties faced by the locals, the civil society is working to reopen the boarding schools and industries.
The Himalayan Times website, Kathmandu, in English 11 Aug 05
At a meeting of the civil society held today in the presence of a member of the Human Rights Commission, Sudip Pathak, the locals demanded that the Maoists call off all kinds strikes in the district. Addressing the meeting, Pathak urged the locals to boycott Maoist-called bandhs [strikes]. He emphasised on the need for a consensus between political parties and the Maoists to bail the country out of the current crisis.
 Central President of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists Bishnu Nisthuri said commoners have been affected due to violation of human rights by the state and the Maoists. A team of human rights activists and journalists, which is here to monitor the 24-day long Mechi bandh, visited private schools in the district headquarters.
 Meanwhile, the Maoists today called off the tea estate bandh, realising the problems of the workers. Central Secretary of the All Nepal Tea Workers' Organisation Chandra Sapkota, alias ""Bishal"", told the Human Rights Forum over the telephone that they have called off the bandh. He said that the claim of the Nepal Trade Union that loaded trucks have been allowed to ply on the roads was an attempt to defame their activity.
 The closure of boarding schools has affected 25,000 students and 1,000 teachers. Out of 258 private schools in Ilam, 30 have already been shut down due to the Maoist threats.

 Text of report by Nepalese newspaper The Himalayan Times web site on 24 April
 Kathmandu, 23 April: International human rights watchdog Amnesty International (AI) has expressed deep concern over the imposition of ""severe restrictions"" on people's freedom of movement. Security forces preventing a former Supreme Court [SC] judge and president of the Nepal Bar Association [NBA] from flying to Delhi is an ""ominous sign"" of the government's lack of political will to live up to its recent commitments to the international community, said Purna Sen, director of the Asia and Pacific programme of AI, in a statement.
 ""The action comes barely two days after the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) adopted a resolution on Nepal,"" it said. The resolution, among others, had called on authorities ""to allow all citizens to enter and leave the country freely"".
The Himalayan Times web site, Kathmandu, in English 24 Apr 05
AI, however, lauded the authorities for releasing 60 prisoners of conscience, but expressed concern over the continuing deterioration of rights situation.
 ""Fundamental rights remain suspended, widespread arrests continue and the media is operating under strict censorship. In addition, fighting between security forces and Maoists has increased and a disturbing new phenomenon of vigilante violence has emerged.""
 With an objective to reduce human rights monitoring and reporting, the authorities have prevented a number of human rights defenders from leaving Kathmandu. Their names are reportedly on a list compiled by security forces of those persons whose travel has been restricted, according to AI.
 Meanwhile, the Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Studies flayed the authorities for barring former SC judge Lakshman Aryal, NBA president Shambhu Thapa, and advocate Bhimarjun Acharya from flying to New Delhi. The government's act was against its agreement at the recently concluded 61st session of the UNCHR, it said in its statement.
 The NBA, on the other hand, condemned the government for barring its former president and lawyer Harihar Dahal from travelling to Pokhara today. This, according to NBA, is against the fundamental rights, legal system and the international humanitarian law.

  A spokesman of the Defence Ministry said three infiltrators fell into the River Kishan Ganga after they were shot dead by the security forces. He also confirmed the deaths of six other infiltrators.
  Security forces, however, are continuing their search of the area, and the spokesman said that the sanitation drive would be completed in a few days. He said security forces took time to reach the heights because of very difficult terrain and bad weather.
  Meanwhile, the Pakistan-backed Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen militant outfit has claimed responsbility for the infiltration bid into the Gurez Valley. In a statement faxed to various newspaper offices, it said that four militants, including Commander of TUM for Gurez, Aashiq Hussain, a resident of Lolab, had been killed in the operation.
  Elsewhere in the valley a top militant Commander and a soldier were among six people killed overnight. Official sources said troops guarding the Line of Control (LoC) in Keran sector noticed the militants sneaking into Indian territory and engaged them in a gunbattle. This was the third infiltration attempt by militants during the past four days. 
  On Friday, Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Bangalore that the infiltration set up  in  Pakistan  is fully intact.
  ""The infrastructure for launching the infiltrators from the other side  of border is intact and whatever little bit improvement  of 
 the situation has taken place is not that they have given up  the efforts  of  infiltrating  but it is because  if  the  vigilance, 
 surveillance  of our armed forces,"" Mukherjee told  reporters  in Bangalore.
  The fierce standoff in Gurez sector began on Tuesday evening. India  says  there  has  been a rise  in  incursion  attempts  by 
 militants from across the border in the past few months,  warning it had the potential to undermine peace initiatives.
  Despite  improving  bilateral ties, it says,  Islamabad  has  not stopped  militants  from operating on its soil or  crossing  into 
 Indian Kashmir.
  More  than 45,000 people have been killed in Jammu  and  Kashmir, mainly   Hindu  India's  only  Muslim-majority  state,  since   a 
 separatist revolt started in 1989.
  Mukherjee  also  clarified  that no  lethal  weapons  were  being supplied  to  strife-torn  Nepal  since  an  embargo  on  defence 
 dealings imposed soon after February's royal coup, was revoked.
  New  Delhi  a  major aid donor and  key  arms  supplier  restored limited  weapons  supply to the Kingdom after a  meeting  between 
 Prime  Minister Manmohan Singh and Gyanendra at  Bandung  earlier this year.
  ""After  the Bandung meeting between the Prime Minister and  Nepal King it was decided to resume arms supply but not lethal weapons, no lethal material for instance mine protection vehicles and some other  equipment we have supplied but regular supply we have  not  started,"" Mukherjee said.

The king and his wife Queen Komal arrived in Burundi from Tanzania and went to the Burumata military base where most of the 944 Nepalese soldiers are stationed, the UN Operation in Burundi (ONUB) said.
No details of the ONUB visit were immediately available but the king and queen later made a courtesy call on Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza before departing Bujumbura en route to Cairo.
Nepal is the third-largest troop contributor to ONUB which has been in Burundi since June of last year helping the small central African nation to recover from 12 years of bloody ethnically driven civil war.
The mission has some 5,500 peacekeepers stationed throughout the country.
Gyanendra, who had visited Bangladesh and South Africa before going to Tanzania and Burundi, is under increasing pressure at home where is expected to return on December 2.
On Friday, more than 30,000 people defied a government ban to take part in a communist-convened anti-monarchy rally in western Nepal, demanding that the small Himalayan kingdom become a republic.
Gyanendra sacked a four-party coalition and took full control of the government in February, defending the move from international condemnation by saying he needed emergency powers to stop a Maoist insurgency that has claimed more than 12,000 lives since 1996.

 'Sending troops is not an option open to India,' Indian Ambassador to Nepal Shyam Saran said at a farewell meeting with Nepalese and foreign reporters here.
'We have been helping and will continue help Nepal in many other different ways to battle the insurgency,' said the Indian envoy, who will from Aug. 1 assume the post of secretary at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.
 India would like to help Nepal grapple with the Maoist rebel insurgency by 'strengthening the capability of your military forces,' the envoy added.
 India is assisting Nepal by providing military hardware, including attack helicopters, and training to Royal Nepalese Army, and the two countries have recently stepped up cooperation in exchange of insurgency-related intelligence information.
 'We are ready to give more,' he said.
 India, which in Nepal is sometimes charged with harboring Maoist rebel leaders in its territory, considers the violence to be an 'illegitimate' means of achieving the rebels' political goals, Saran said.
 The envoy mentioned the 1,445-kilometer open border between Nepal and India and said 'Nepal's Maoists are also a security problem to India.'
 The rebels took up arms against Nepalese government in 1996 to replace monarchy with a communist republic. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the nine years of fighting.
 India sent troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce a peace accord, but the troops ended up fighting the Tamil separatist guerrillas, who accused them of siding with the Sri Lankan government. The troops were withdrawn in 1990 after the death of nearly 1,200 soldiers.

Responding to last week's formal letter from the government inviting the rebels to sit down for a third round of negotiations, chief rebel negotiator Baburam Bhattarai said King Gyanendra himself should take part in the talks to legitimize them.
The king should otherwise make public announcements to the effect that the government negotiating team is authorized to make decisions and that he would fully implement any decisions taken, Bhattarai said in his reply given to the government Wednesday through talks facilitators.
The rebel leader also accused the army of consistently violating an agreed code of conduct following the January cease-fire as part of preparations for military rule of the country.
In the process, Nepal has allowed hundreds of military experts and advisers from the United States into the country, he said, and demanded the deportation of all foreign military experts and advisers.
He also reiterated the rebels' demand that the government should honor and implement the decisions of the second round of talks, which included limiting the movement of the army to 5 kilometers from barracks or bases.
The government should spell out its position on the rebels' political demands, mainly on a new Constitution, before going for a third round, he said.
The rebels, who took up arms against the Nepalese government in 1996, held two round of peace talks with the previous government, following a cease-fire in January this year.
The rebels took up arms against the government in 1996 to abolish the monarchy and end multiparty rule in Nepal, though they now say they would settle for constitutional monarchy and allow multiparty democracy.

Kathmandu, 9 October: Maoist combatants at the Hattikhor cantonment [Nawalparasi District, south-central Nepal] have detained a group of security personnel and media persons who had gone to the camp to deliver relief packages to them.
The team of six policemen and five media persons had gone to the Maoist Fourth Division camp to hand over 50,000 rupees [approx 800 US dollars] provided by the Motherland, an organization of Nepalis' diaspora in the United States.
The Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) division commander, Pratikshya, said that they were detained since the policemen had entered camp with arms against the comprehensive peace accord. She said they were being interrogated.

The surgery on Laleh and Ladan Bijani, 28, could be scheduled as early as next week, said an official from the Raffles Medical Group though others have said it could be delayed until July.
The sisters have tried for years to persuade doctors to attempt the procedure. German doctors concluded in 1996 that surgery could kill one or both of the women because they share an artery that feeds blood to their brains.
Last year, doctors in Singapore said they believed the surgery was possible, but that the decision on whether to proceed would be left up to the twins.
""They seem determined to go through with this,"" Dr. Keith Goh, head of the team of surgeons working with the twins, said last December.
The hospital plans a news conference Monday to discuss the surgery.
X-rays and scans revealed two separate brains surrounded by one skull, doctors have said. If the surgery is successful, the women will be left with palm-sized cavities on their heads.
After a lifetime of sacrifices to accommodate each other, the women have said they do not want to live joined together any longer.
Their hopes of living separate lives were rekindled last year when they read about how Goh separated infant twins from Nepal who were similarly fused at the skull. The sisters arrived in Singapore on Nov. 20 from Iran for medical and psychological evaluations.
Laleh hopes the surgery will allow her to pursue her dream of working as a journalist in Tehran, while Ladan wants to earn a graduate degree in law and move back home with their parents in Shiraz.

Two men were shot and slightly wounded by security guards when they tried to storm the Egyptian embassy, which represents Iraqi interests in the Himalayan kingdom, police and a doctor said.
The streets returned to normal after the government clamped an indefinite curfew and declared a national day of mourning Thursday for the victims of the worst hostage massacre in Iraq since the US-led invasion.
Demonstrators, some chanting ""Punish the Muslims!"", swept through Kathmandu early Wednesday, throwing stones and ransacking any targets with Arabic-language script.
Protesters climbed on top of and set fire to the Jama Masjid mosque, the largest shrine of the city's small Muslim minority, after pulling out its furniture and electrical equipment for a sidewalk bonfire.
Riot police used batons to push the crowd of some 5,000 people out of a sensitive central area which includes King Gyanendra's Narayanhity Palace, a police officer said.
The mosque suffered only minor damage but many of its contents were destroyed.
The protests erupted late Tuesday after news that the 12, who left the impoverished nation in search of jobs, were murdered by militants who abducted them about 10 days ago.
The kidnappers accused them of cooperating with US forces.
A mob made up mainly of youths broke windows of more than a dozen employment agencies blamed for sending Nepalese to Iraq and set fire to their vehicles, furniture and computers, police said.
An employee at Qatar Airways, one of the main airlines used by Nepalese seeking jobs in the Middle East, said dozens of angry people stormed into their premises and smashed furniture before setting the building on fire.
The employee estimated damage in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Many protesters also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, saying he should take responsibility for the failure to free the hostages.
The government had repeatedly stressed that Nepal, which is fighting a bloody Maoist rebellion, was not part of the US-led coalition in Iraq.
Deuba appealed for calm in an address to the nation Wednesday.
""The terrorists who committed this gruesome act don't have any religion or principles. I call upon all citizens of Nepal to have patience,"" he said.
""We made honest efforts to save them but the militants never spelt out their conditions,"" Deuba said. ""We are now trying our best to bring back the bodies of the victims.""
His government announced compensation of one million rupees (14,400 dollars) for the families of each of the 12 slain hostages, a major sum in the one of the world's poorest countries.
The Himalayan capital's skies were patrolled by army helicopters, which were last called out last week when Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the monarchy ordered a halt to traffic to and from the city of 1.5 million people.
Hindus make up more than 86 percent of the population in Nepal, the world's only officially Hindu state. But the kingdom has experienced little of the inter-religious violence that has scarred neighbouring India.
Muslims account for 3.8 percent of the 27 million population. Some 7.8 percent adhere to Buddhism in Nepal, which is the birthplace of the Buddha, with smaller religions comprising 2.2 percent.
Spontaneous protest strikes were called in the towns of Pokhara, Gorkha and Biratnagar with youths taking to the streets to stop vehicles.
A statement announcing the killings was posted on an Islamist website by an Al-Qaeda-linked group called the Army of Ansar al-Sunna.
It was accompanied by pictures of the grisly beheading of a blindfolded hostage, including one where his bloodied head was held up like a trophy by a hooded captor. A video showed the other Nepalese being shot.

The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has expressed ""extreme concern"" over actions taken by a Maoist district people's court against journalists Yekandra Kumar Kunwar and Birendra Rawal.

In the statement addressed to Maoist spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Warren has also urged the Maoists to uphold their commitment to a free and independent press and immediately cease all action, legal and otherwise, against the duo.

"7877",20112858,"Title: Govt exempts 70% VAT on sugar to fix new price of sugarcane.rtf; Date: January 3, 2011 Monday; Text: KATHMANDU, Jan. 3 -- Agitating sugarcane farmers called off their protest on Monday after the government fixed sugarcane price at Rs 401 per quintal, exempting existing Valued Added Tax (VAT) on sugar by 70 percent.
""During a meeting held at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), sugar mills agreed to purchase sugarcane from farmers at Rs 401 quintals at par with the price offered last year after Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal announced 70 percent VAT exemption on sugar,"" said Kapil Muni Mainali, president of Sugarcane Farmers' Association.
With the partial exemption of VAT on sugar, the cost per quintal of sugar would go down by Rs 43.
The Ministry of Finance on Sunday had proposed 60 percent VAT exemption on sugar. However, farmers had continued their agitation on Monday, bringing vehicular movement along East-West Highway in eastern Nepal to a grinding halt.
Prior to fresh revision in prices, sugar mills were offering Rs 320 per quintal of sugarcane. They had said that they would be able to offer Rs 421 per quintal of sugarcane as demanded by the farmers only if the government became ready to completely waive VAT on sugar.
Sugarcane farmers in different Tarai districts had been staging protest for the last couple of months, demanding the government to fix reasonable price for their produce. Over 1.5 million farmers across the country are involved in sugarcane farming.
Earlier, The farmers had partially closed the East-West Highway on Sunday and Monday and had announced complete blockade from Tuesday.
They had threatened to disrupt the highway for an indefinite period starting Tuesday citing inappropriate price evaluation of sugarcane. The farmers claimed they were forced to make the announcement as the government turned deaf ears to their agitation for the past two weeks.
The farmers had clashed with police in Sarlahi in their attempt to block the highway for two hours on Sunday. Police fired into the air and used tear-gas shells to disperse thousands of farmers who were demanding increase in the price of sugarcane on Sunday.
The District Administration Office on Monday was forced to clamp a curfew along the highway in Sarlahi to contain possible violnece as the farmers had planned to continue protests even through Monday. The curfew was effective from 8am to 5pm Monday Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

 The British forces in Basra have announced the return of normal life following the incidents of the past two days and the confrontations between the citizens and the British forces.
 Capt Hisham Halawi, the official spokesman of the British forces in southern Iraq, has stated that calm had returned to the south (Basra, Al-Zubayr and Safwan).
 In a telephone interview with Al-Watan, Halawi added that about 25m litres of petrol were currently being distributed to petrol stations in Basra at market prices and not at the black-market prices which led to a petrol shortage in Basra.
Al-Watan web site, Abha, in Arabic 12 Aug 03
Halawi affirmed that the British forces, together with Iraqi police, would be deployed to ensure the fair distribution of petrol to everyone.
 The British forces spokesman denied that the British man killed in Basra was from the military, noting that he worked with a company which is carrying out economic projects in the south and was an employee of a private security company.
 Regarding the level of services, Halawi said that British engineers are working with Iraqi engineers to repair the main electricity networks in Safwan, Al-Zubayr and the centre of Basra, and that electricity will be restored soon.
 An Iraqi citizen and a Nepalese member of a security service working for the provisional authority of the American-British coalition in southern Iraq were killed in Basra on Sunday.
 The spokesman explained that some Nepalese elements, who formerly served in the British army, are currently working for private security companies in Iraq.
 Halawi ended his interview with Al-Watan saying that traffic has returned to the centre of the city, while British soldiers had taken up positions at petrol stations to regulate the distribution of petrol.
 British officials earlier stated that tribal leaders had talked to the angry residents to restore order in the second largest city in Iraq.

    Due to the escalating anti-government insurgency, Nepal's  ranking as a tourist destination dropped from 10 in 2003 to 27 in  2004, according to a list released by iExplore.com, the Chicago- based tourism company.
    Nepal has been a traditional top 10 adventure destination for  several successive years. The ranking has been determined on the  basis of vacation packages purchased under the company's adventure and experimental traveler's programs.
    According to the company, tourist traffic to Nepal has declined because of the fighting between the anti-government guerrillas and government forces.
    China, which ranked fourth in 2003, improved its position to  occupy the third rank just behind Egypt. The other destinations  among the top 10 include India, Italy, Chile, Costa Rica, France  and Alaska of the United States.

Monday's attack was in Kavre district 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the capital Kathmandu, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The Maoists opened indiscriminate fire at troops in Kavre district at around 9:00 a.m. Monday,"" he said. ""The Maoists fired from the jungle where locals were collecting animal feed, so our troops did not return fire.""
The army said earlier Monday that soldiers had killed 16 Maoists in a gunbattle on Sunday afternoon in the west of the country.
""The troops have recovered 16 bodies of the Maoists after the clash which lasted for almost two hours,"" an official, who declined to be named, told AFP.
Sunday's gunbattle began when rebels attacked troops near Palpa 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Kathmandu. It was the scene of a February 1 clash that resulted in the deaths of four soldiers and seven police officers.
No security forces were killed in Sunday's encounter, the army officer said, but details of the number of injured have not been disclosed.
On Sunday the army chief said soldiers were ""heading towards the path of victory"" against the Maoists, who have been fighting to establish a communist republic for the last decade.
Military analysts have said the army cannot defeat the guerrillas in their rural heartland, and the Maoists cannot take the well-defended capital and surrounding valley.
King Gyanendra sacked the government and took direct control of the country a year ago, claiming it was corrupt and had failed to quell the Maoist insurgency.
Last November mainstream opposition parties entered a loose alliance with the Maoists, a move that has brought criticism from the United States.
US ambassador James F. Moriarty, in an interview with private television, made a new appeal to the king to reach out to the political parties and restore parliamentary democracy.
He also said the agreement between the political parties and the rebels is dangerous for the parties.
""If the palace and the parties don't cooperate, if the king does not reach out, if they don't plan a way back to democracy, the current state of affairs will not last long. And, I think the most likely result is the collapse of the state and the Maoists will make use of that,"" Moriarty said in the interview, according to the Kathmandu Post Monday.
Since the Maoists ended a fou- month unilateral ceasefire in early January, more than 160 rebels, civilians and security personnel have been killed.
In the decade since the rebels began their ""people's war"" in the impoverished Himalayan nation, some 12,500 people have been killed and between 100,000 and 200,000 people have been displaced.

""By reiterating calls for general elections within a year, the king and royal army have made it clear that they want to continue their rule over people and country,"" Prachanda said in an emailed statement.
King Gyanendra, the world's last Hindu monarch, renewed a call for national elections in the troubled Himalayan nation in a Nepali New Year address Friday.
The last week saw thousands of people demonstrate across Nepal against the royal regime. Four protesters were killed by security services and hundreds detained.
""Now it is clear that Nepali people's wish for democracy and peace will be fulfilled only after taking the ongoing movement to the pinnacle of success,"" said the Maoist supremo.
""People from all walks of life are raising voices for democracy and peace by fighting the autocratic feudal regime's barbarism,"" Prachandra said.
Opposition forces which were sidelined when the king took direct control in February 2005 entered a loose alliance with the rebels late last year.
Authorities in Nepal said the protests this week had been ""thoroughly infiltrated"" by rebels and that was why the government arrested political leaders, banned on protests, cut mobile phones and imposed curfew.
Opposition politicians dismissed the king's call for dialogue and elections and vowed to keep up their anti-royal protests.
Since the rebels began theie ""People's War"" in 1996, some 12,500 people have been killed.

The seven villages, located about 700 km west of Kathmandu, have an estimated population of over 6,000.
""The rebels had been collecting data from the area a week ago announcing that a member from each family has to accompany them for their so-called public campaign,"" the locals said.
It is unclear where the captives have been taken, they added.
Nearly 10,000 Nepalese people have lost their lives since the anti-government insurgency broke out in the Himalayan kingdom in early 1996.

"6469",20082140,"Title: BHUTANESE REFUGEES SEND MEMORANDUM TO INDIAN PM.rtf; Date: May 16, 2008 Friday 5:59 PM  EST; Text: Kathmandu, May 16 (UNI) Various human rights organisations of Bhutan have requested Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to help solve the long-standing political and refugee crisis there just ahead of his visit. Human Rights Organisations including National Front for Democracy, Bhutan (NFD) and Human Rights Organisation Bhutan (HUROB) sought his help. 
""Over 108,000 Bhutanese, after being victimized by Bhutan's ultra-nationalist policy, have been forced to live as refugees,"" NFD memorandum is quoted as saying in the local media. ""The drama of democracy being staged recently has not only failed to address the sentiments of those exiled, but also of those living inside the country."" ""We request consideration of the genesis of armed struggle by refugee youths, after being pessimistic due to the infernal refugee life for over one-and-half decade,"" read the HUROB letter sent to Dr Singh. The organisations also expected the visit to be crucial for refugee repatriation and India's role in the process. Meanwhile, Bhutanese refugee leader Rong Thong Kinley Dorji , who is spending his exiled life in New Delhi of India, also expressed hope that the visit would be important for establishing real democracy and begin repatriation of Bhutanese refugees who are languishing in various camps in eastern Nepal and India. Some of the refugees have been resettled in the US and New Zealand. Some EU countries and Australia have also agreed to resettle the Bhutanese refugees. The Bhutanese of Nepalese origin were excluded from Bhutan since early 1990s.

"5611",20061113,"Title: UNDERWORLD DON ARRESTED NEAR NEPAL BORDER.rtf; Date: August 9, 2006 Wednesday 3:32 AM  EST; Text: NEW DELHI, Aug 09 -- Fazal-ur-Rehman wanted in connection with several cases of kidnapping, was arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell at Sanauli along the Indo-Nepal border on Sunday. He was wanted by the CBI and the Interpol had issued red corner notices against him. 
  Delhi Police Commissioner K.K. Paul on Monday said they had reliable inputs indicating that Fazal, who earlier operated from Dubai for seven years, shifted his base to Malaysia and then to Nepal last year. He started operating from Nepal so that he could visit his native place at Darbhanga in Bihar by crossing the porous India -Nepal border. 
  Although the police kept receiving inputs about Fazal's frequent visits to Darbhanga, they were unable to track him down, as he would change his route. However, on Sunday, a police team received a tip-off that Falzu would cross the border through Sonouli. Subsequently, a trap was laid. 
  During interrogation, Fazal allegedly confessed to having made threat calls to a Gujarat-based saree tycoon Pankaj Agarwal at the instance of Bollywood heroin Shilpa Shetty's parents about three years ago when he was operating from Malaysia. 
  The police said that Fazal entered the world of crime in 1988 when he was arrested in a kidnapping case. He was lodged in the Darbhanga jail for four years, during which he came close to a criminal named Jameel Khan. After being released, he started collecting protection money on Jameel's behalf. 
  Police said Fazal came to Delhi after Jameel was shifted to the Tihar Jail. In 1994, Jameel got Kanwaljit Singh kidnapped from the Patiala House courts. In 1995, Fazal was arrested in a case. In Tihar Jail, he came in contact with underworld don Babloo Srivastava. After being released, Fazal went to Dubai from where he began making extortion calls to businessmen.
