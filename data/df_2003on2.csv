"573",20031976,"Title: Pakistan Airlines to resume flights to India in January.rtf; Date: December 11, 2003 Thursday; Text: Just days after Pakistan and India lifted their two-year suspension on air links, Pakistan International Airlines announced Thursday it will begin operating six flights a week to two Indian cities in January.
PIA's marketing director, Kamran Hasan, said the airline also plans to boost its total flights to India to 12 in March, the same number it flew before the ban was imposed due to strained relations.
Beginning the first week of January, the airline will operate two flights each on its Karachi-New Delhi, Karachi-Bombay and Lahore-New Delhi routes, Hasan said.
Earlier this month, as part of confidence-building measures, India and Pakistan agreed to restore airline overflight and landing rights by Jan. 1, two years after the nuclear-armed rivals cut all transportation links amid tensions that took them to the brink of war.
Hasan said PIA, Pakistan's state-run airline, also plans to resume six flights to three other South Asian destinations in January: two to the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka; two to Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo; and two to Nepal's capital, Katmandu. PIA closed these flights because they were too costly when India barred Pakistani overflights in early 2002.

"4960",2006566,"Title: Roundup_ Guerrillas atrocities push kids into stone quarries in Nepal by Dhruba Paudel, Wang Haijing.rtf; Date: January 1, 2006 Sunday 9:00 AM EST; Text: The constant threatening of the  anti-government guerrillas to join their outfit coupled with  extreme poverty led many kids from different parts of Nepal to  work in stone quarries in central Nepal.
    Sanjeeb Kumar Bhujel, migrated from eastern Khotang district  because of guerrillas threatening, is an example of those  thousands of kids who is working in stone quarries since last two  years at Agra river in central Dhading district, some 50 km west  of Kathmandu.
    Sanjeeb's 12-year old brother Rabin, a grade seven student also joined his brother quitting his studies since the last two months. ""The guerrillas repeatedly coerced me to join them, thus I had no  way out other than to join my brother,"" Rabin told Xinhua with a  gloomy face.
    Though the guerrillas were all out to get both the brothers  recruited in their group, they were strictly against the idea.  They had to feed the guerrillas at any cost whenever they arrive  at their village. ""The reality is such we were not in a condition  to feed our family for a whole year,"" both the brothers said in a  same voice.
    More than 40 percent of all stone quarry workers are migrants,  according to the study of Concern for Children and Environment in  Nepal (CCEN), a non-government organization working with the kids  of the stone quarries. 
    Many of them came to the city looking for better jobs, even  more fleeing a devastated rural economy and the real possibility  of getting caught in the cross fire of a war between the  guerrillas and the government's security forces since 1996, Bijaya Sainju, chief of CCEN noted.
    Nearly 85 percent of the stone quarry children came to work  there through a parent or family member. Of those parents, more  than 95 percent were illiterate.
    Though some cited the fact that kids are able to work along  with their families as proof that the stone quarry industry is  among the country's more child-friendly sectors, such family bonds are one of the major obstacles to child rights groups seeking to  end under age labor, Sainju noted.
    Many parents from the villages are illiterate, and they don't  see any immediate returns from sending them to school. ""So, they  want their children to work instead of going to school,"" Sainju  noted, adding, ""These stone quarry children are always deprived of their basic rights to education, health, and recreation.""
    It is estimated about 32,000 children now are working in the  stone quarrying industry of Nepal and a majority of them are  between 11 and 13 years of age, Sainju revealed.
    The average age of child laborers in the stone quarries is 12  years, a full year younger than the national average for other  sectors. More than two-thirds of those children worked from nine  to 10 hours every day and still others regularly pulled to 12-hour shifts. ""And it is not uncommon to see children as young as five  working alongside adults,"" Sainju quoted a statistics conducted by the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child, as  saying.
    In 1992, the Nepali government passed the Children's Act with  the highly publicized goal of protecting the rights of all  children and placing a ban on the use of children under the age of 14 in the workplace. 
    The law was later followed up with the Children's Regulation of 1994, and most recently with the Child Labor Prohibition and  Regulation Act passed in 2000.
    On paper, Nepal should be on equal footing with the countries  of Western Europe and North America. But though donor countries  place much pressure upon the governments of the developing world  to sign onto international conventions, such measures have proved  largely unenforceable. And in reality, Nepal currently has one of  the world's worst reputations for child exploitation.
    Gauri Pradhan is president of Child Workers in Nepal, a  pressure group that pushed hard for laws to protect children and  which is now having to work even harder to get them enforced.
    ""The Nepali government is good and progressive at creating laws and ratifying international conventions,"" he said, adding, ""They  are just very bad at implementing them. And children suffer a  great deal because of this.""
    Under age workers now make up a full quarter of the workforce,  contributing at least 10 percent of Nepal's total GDP.
    All of this has led many Nepalis to view international pressure to completely do away with child labor as both impractical and  potentially harmful to the country's overall economic development, Sainju added.

"5787",20073621,"Title: Maoists set to enter parliament as Nepal cabinet okays constitution.rtf; Date: January 14, 2007 Sunday 12:42 PM GMT; Text: The transformation of Nepal's Maoists from rebels to mainstream politicians moved closer Sunday after the cabinet approved an interim constitution giving the ultra-leftists seats in a new parliament.
The rebels will hold 25 per cent of the seats in the temporary parliament.
""The cabinet meeting Sunday approved the finalised interim constitution due to be presented before parliament tomorrow,"" Deputy Prime Minister Amik Sherchan told AFP.
""The Maoists will enter parliament for the first time and the house session will pass the interim constitution on the same day after discussions,"" he added.
The former rebels fought a violent ""people's war"" for a decade in the impoverished Himalayan nation to install a communist republic, but have now agreed to join mainstream politics.
The Maoists said the entry into parliament of former rebels was a huge step for the country.
""It will be yet another historic moment for us and all Nepali people,"" Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said.
The former rebels will work with other parties in parliament and ""focus on the social and economic transformation of the country"", Mahara said.
The temporary constitution has provisions stripping the king of his status as head of state, with his executive powers passing to the prime minister.
The interim constitution grants the former rebels 83 seats in a new 330-seat parliament. Among their delegates are representatives of marginalised groups never present in parliament in Nepal before.
The Maoists are expected to join the cabinet within a couple of weeks, but negotiations are still to take place on which posts they will hold.
Once former foes, the rebels and government have observed a ceasefire for nearly nine months, and the rebels have agreed to place their weapons and army under UN monitoring.
The Maoists are expected to start placing their weapons in containers under UN supervision Monday, but as part of the peace deal the rebels will retain  keys to the locked-up weapons.
""We are waiting for the United Nations and we are ready to begin registering our weapons. On our side, everything has been completed,"" the rebel spokesman said.
The parliament, due to be sworn in Monday, will oversee elections to a body that will draft a new version of Nepal's constitution and address the future of the monarchy, a long-held rebel demand.
The Maoists are keen to see Nepal become a republic but some other parties want a ceremonial monarchy.
King Gyanendra reinstated parliament in April after weeks of often violent mass protests calling on him to end direct rule.
The rebels and seven parties in government struck a loose alliance in November 2005 after the king seized direct control earlier that year.
The Maoist insurgency began in western Nepal with an attack on a police post in 1996, and claimed at least 12,500 people lives. It also dealt a hammer blow to Nepal's already fragile economy.

"4936",20064571,"Title: Nepal Legislators Move to Curb the King's Powers.rtf; Date: May 19, 2006 Friday; Text: Late Edition - Final
Nepal's newly reinstated Parliament approved a far-reaching measure on Thursday that is intended to shrink the king's power, abolishing his Privy Council, requiring that he pay taxes and, most important, stripping him of authority over the army.
  That last provision appears to flout the Constitution, which plainly describes the king's authority over the military. Lawmakers insist that their action overrides all other laws, but their measure seems certain to be challenged in court.
The resolution, however, satisfies loud public calls to reduce the king's power. Three weeks of violent street protests led King Gyanendra, who took full control of the state in February 2005, to cede power to an interim government late last month. ''Hang the king!'' was a popular mantra of the demonstrators.
  Even this week, after Parliament failed to take up the new measure on Monday as it had planned, protesters took to the streets, burned cars and demonstrated angrily against the legislature. 
  The latest step to diminish the king's authority may also be temporary. The government has promised to hold elections for an assembly that would rewrite the Constitution, potentially ridding Nepal of a monarchy altogether. That has long been a principal demand of Maoist rebels who have been fighting a decade-long insurgency, and in recent months appears to have gained traction among citizens, particularly the youth.
  On Thursday the 205-member legislature, removed by Gyanendra in 2002 and reinstated after his concession on April 24, unanimously approved the resolution by a voice vote, Reuters reported from Katmandu.
  The measure, declaring Nepal to be a secular nation, also strips the label ''His Majesty's Government'' from government institutions, a powerful symbolic move intended to enfeeble the throne. Nepal is the world's only Hindu kingdom, with the king regarded by some as a direct descendant of a Hindu god.
  Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said Thursday as he introduced the resolution, referring to the protests against Gyanendra, ''It reflects the aspirations of the people and respects the sacrifices of the people who were martyred during the movement.''
  Mr. Koirala's government has already called for peace talks with the rebels, freed some of their top commanders and reciprocated a cease-fire announced by the Maoists.
  Last week the government ordered the detention of five former royal government ministers, under a long-established law called the Public Security Act. The United Nations human rights envoy in Nepal, Ian Martin, has since expressed concern over the arrests, saying the government should be ''setting new standards for fully respecting human rights and upholding the rule of law.''

Itahari [town in eastern Nepal], 22 August: Possibility of talks between the government and the Terai [southern plains] Janatantrik Mukti Morcha [Republican Liberation Front] (Goit group), which had until some time ago stipulated various conditions for talks, has now increased.
A central leader of the group has said that talks are going to take place between the government and his group, which has been raising arms and engaging in the politics of killings, violence and abductions.
Morang-Sunsari [two districts in eastern Nepal] in-charge of the group, Sanket, disclosed this in a press statement issued on Tuesday [21 August]. The statement says that his group is ready for talks with the government. Sanket said that his group and the United Nations are about to hold talks at a location in Morang or Sunsari district.
He claimed that the date and venue for talks between the United Nations and his group prior to talks with the government have been readied. However, he did not disclose the time and venue for the talks.
He also claimed that his group would sit for talks with the government soon as per the commitment expressed by convenor of his group Jaya Krishna Goit to talks under mediation by the United Nations. The statement said that his group was ready to resolve the problem through talks and urged the group's workers not to raise donations or carry out abductions or killings of individuals.
Although talks with the Goit group are about to take place there are no indications of talks with the Jwala Singh group of the Janatantrik Mukti Morcha. On the contrary the leaders of that group have been totally rejecting all talks. Before this, the Goit group had also refused to talk.

 Party President Puspa Kamal Dahal, in a statement, said politburo member Matrika Yadav and alternate member Suresh Ale Magar were held and handed over to Nepalese authorities by the Indian government last Sunday.
His party 'is angry at the arrest and handover and calls on all human rights groups, intellectuals, and civil society of Nepal and India to raise concern and voices for their release,' said Dahal, who is widely known as Prachanda.
 Earlier Tuesday, a Nepalese newspaper reported the arrest and handover of the two Maoist leaders as the latest case of India's assistance to Nepal in tackling the Himalayan kingdom's eight-year insurgency.
 India, which shares a 1,445-kilometer open border with Nepal, is often castigated for allegedly giving shelter to Nepalese rebel leaders, charges India denies.
 The Kantipur daily said Yadav and Magar were arrested by Indian security forces in Lucknow, northern India, on a tip from the Nepalese government.
 Yadav was a member of the Maoist rebel team in peace talks with the Nepalese government and Magar is a senior ideologue of the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist).
 The peace talks collapsed last August.
 The Indian government has pledged to arrest Nepalese rebels when information about their movements inside India is available.
 Last August, senior Maoist rebel leader C.P. Gajurel was arrested in Chennai, southern India, on his way to London.
 He is being tried by an Indian court for carrying a fake passport.

After the polls closed at 5 p.m., the spokesman of the Election Commission, Tejmuni Bajracharya, said municipalities in towns of southeast Nepal recorded a high turnout of voters.
The Rautahat municipality recorded the highest turnout of 74 percent followed by Malangawa at 60 percent.
However, the capital Kathmandu recorded a dismal turnout of 8 percent, he said, adding that the commission is still working out the national turnout.
Counting of votes will begin on Thursday, with all results of the municipal elections slated be declared in three days, he said.
Earlier, an election official in Madhayapur town, about 30 kilometers east of the capital, said only 30 voters had showed up by noon at one booth where some 1,500 voters were registered.
The Maoist rebels in the evening called off their general strike, which was supposed to run until Saturday.
Top rebel leaders said that the strike, which began Sunday, was withdrawn early because ""we have successfully foiled the elections.""
Nepal's major political parties boycotted the elections, saying they do not address the nation's problems and will only perpetuate King Gyanendra's undemocratic rule.
The parties organized scattered protests in the capital on Wednesday, and police said over a dozen protesters attempting to disrupt the election were arrested.
Protest organizers claimed that hundreds were arrested.
There were two major incidents of violence Wednesday related to the election.
In the western town of Dang, an army soldier opened fire at a group of party workers protesting against the municipal polls, killing one party worker and injuring another.
Earlier, a suspected Maoist rebel was shot dead as he tried to set off an ambush near a polling booth at the town of Dhanagdhi, also in western Nepal.
Suspected Maoist rebels also opened fire at a polling station in Biratnagar, eastern Nepal, but no one was injured, according to the reports.
The last election for Nepal's 58 municipalities was in 1997.
In October 2002, Nepal's parliamentary democracy came to a screeching halt with the king's sacking of an elected government. The constitutional monarch followed up in February 2005 by seizing executive power for himself, though he vowed to reactivate multiparty democracy within three years.

"1911",2004193,"Title: Nepalese official slams ministry's response to Iraq hostage crisis.rtf; Date: September 8, 2004, Wednesday; Text: An unidentified Nepalese Foreign Ministry official has heavily criticized the government's response to the Iraq hostage crisis, saying that Kathmandu must learn from the Indian experience. (Three Indians were released after 42 days in captivity in Iraq, just days after the murder of 12 Nepalese hostages.) The official said communication was never effectively established with the hostage-takers, and that the government was completely unable to convey a coherent message to the hostage-takers either through the media or diplomatic channels. He blamed a shortage of linguists within the ministry, as well as a shift in focus in recent years from political to economic diplomacy, and said diplomatic appointments in recent years have been made as awards for service to a political party of family rather than on the basis of experience or qualifications. The following is the text of a report by Nepalese daily newspaper Rajdhani on 8 September
 Kathmandu, 7 September: Unless total reform is brought in the working system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is the possibility of the recurrence of the incident of 31 August. Foreign affairs experts have expressed the opinion that the Foreign Ministry need to propel itself with special programmes and upgrade its competence level and skills to save the Nepalese abroad from possible difficulties.
Rajdhani, Kathmandu, in Nepali 8 Sep 04, p1
""If we had diplomats with the knowledge of Arabic language, we could have communicated our position to the Iraqi terrorists. After hearing what we had to say, there was ample possibility of securing the release of the hostages, said a high level official at the Foreign Ministry to Rajdhani, remorsefully. The high-level official, who did not want to be named, said we could not save them even when the conditions set by the terrorists had been met.
 The kidnappers Ansar-al-Sunnah had wanted the Nepalese not to be sent to Iraq to cooperate with the Americans. Of course, the government has no policy of sending its citizens there. Those who went there secretly had gone there as ordinary workers rather than for assisting the Americans. The government could deliver this message to the underground kidnappers within the country through some television channels but it failed to deliver the it to the weapon-wielding terrorists standing beside its abducted citizens. ""Just as all of the Maoists living in the rural areas cannot watch Nepal Television, Ansar-al-Sunnah too could not possibly hear our message through Al-Jazeera and Al Arabiya television channels,"" says the high level official. ""What is the meaning of the message that does not reach its target?""
 Just one day after 12 Nepalese fell victim to the murder due to inadequate efforts of the Nepal government on 1 September , neighbouring India demonstrated its diplomatic skills by securing the release of its three citizens. ""We have to learn from the Indian diplomatic efforts that secured unharmed release of its citizens who went through distressing 42 days in captivity,"" he says.
 Like Nepal, India too has no embassy in Iraq. Like the Nepalese, the Indian civilians had entered Iraq illegally. Though it has been stated that they Indians had been freed after their employer manpower company paid ransom demanded by the Muslim extremist captors, it is known that the amounts were paid by the Indian government itself.
 To secure the release of its citizens, India mobilized its ambassadors in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt. The families of the three abducted citizens and the whole nation could cheer in joy because India had taken initiative by sending to Iraq its ambassador with knowledge of Arabic language that the kidnappers spoke. ""We could bring the same joy in our country also,"" says the high level Foreign Ministry official.
 On 25 August, four days after the Nepalese were taken hostage in Baghdad the government had, through a letter to the interim government in Iraq, reportedly requested for mediation to secure the release of the citizens. But the Iraq government, which is itself in crisis, greeted the request by arresting 14 other Nepalese rather than mediating. The diplomatic meaning of all this was do not let your citizens enter Iraq, that is the solution of the problem.
 Meanwhile, the Nepalese ambassador in Pakistan who also looks into Iraq affairs, Pushkar Man Singh Rajbhandari, and the ambassador in Qatar, Shyamananda Suman, seem to have made some efforts. But their efforts were limited in dialling telephones from their office and writing letters. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Prakash Saran Mahat on Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya television channels said: ""I request for the release of the innocent Nepalese."" This is only the physical effort made by the government.
 The government could not seek a local mediator with the knowledge of Arabic, or make a request through a Muslim country with which Nepal's diplomatic ties are strong, and to which the Iraq's militants give importa"

"4415",20061783,"Title: Nepal expresses shock at killing of labourers in Kashmir.rtf; Date: June 14, 2006 Wednesday 10:47 AM GMT; Text: A Nepalese diplomat Wednesday expressed shock at the killing of Nepalese construction workers in Indian Kashmir this week as Kashmiri groups urged a probe into the incident.
Nine laborers -- eight of them Nepalese -- were building a house in southern Anantnag district Monday when seven gunmen dressed in army fatigues and suspected to be Islamic militants abducted them and later shot them dead.
The ninth victim was from the eastern Indian state of Bihar, police said.
""In Kashmir sporadic incidents (involving Nepalese) have been recorded earlier also but on a scale like this it is really shocking,"" said Tara Pokharel, political counselor at the Nepalese embassy in New Delhi.
Four other laborers, all of them Nepalese, were wounded in the incident, he added.
""We are just trying to get the correct information from the authorities concerned, we have been approaching police officers in the state,"" said Pokharel, adding that some but not all of the victims had been identified.
The workers were from eastern Nepal, he said.
Several groups in Indian-administered Kashmir Wednesday urged the state government to launch a probe into the killings.
""We demand a thorough probe into the killings by some impartial agency under the supervision of judiciary,"" prominent local Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami said in a statement.
""Killing of innocents is becoming a routine now to malign the Kashmiris and these heinous acts are seemingly carried out under a well-planned conspiracy.""
The Kashmir Teacher's Forum, which has thousands of members, termed the shootings ""inhuman.""
Police and the army blamed Islamic rebels fighting Indian rule in divided Kashmir for the massacre but major militant groups denounced the killings and said they were being blamed only to ""malign the freedom struggle and label it as terrorism.""
With increasing numbers of laborers leaving an unstable Nepal for jobs overseas, many have ended up in conflict areas where they face attack.
In 2004, 12 Nepalese working in Iraq were abducted and later killed, prompting a backlash against Muslim-owned businesses in Kathmandu.
Thousands of non-Kashmiri laborers work in Kashmir with the army, private companies and also as domestic help.
Kashmir is in the grip of a 16-year-old insurgency against Indian rule that has so far left more than 44,000 people dead.

Police have arrested four persons on suspicion of involving in the murder of Janakpur-based radio journalist Uma Singh two weeks ago.

Reports quoting local police said the four persons are now undergoing interrogation over their alleged involvement in the murder case.
Earlier, police had arrested four other murder suspects, who are facing investigation.
Although the motive behind the gruesome murder remains unclear some media reports suggest there was a property dispute going on between Uma and her sister-in-law Lalita for some time. [passage omitted]
Singh, a reporter with Today FM in Janakpur, was hacked to death by a gang at her rented single-room apartment on 11 January.
The Federation of Nepalese Journalist (FNJ) has been organizing protest programmes demanding that the government identify the murderers and prosecute them as early as possible.

"2193",20044541,"Title: Authorities beef up security in Nepalese town ahead of reception for king.rtf; Date: March 27, 2004 Saturday; Text: POKHARA, Nepal (AP)- Hundreds of government soldiers patrolled the streets of this mountain resort town on Saturday to thwart any attempt by Maoist rebels to disrupt a huge public reception for Nepal's king.
Thousands of people are expected to attend the rally for King Gyanendra at a stadium in Pokhara on Sunday.
Some residents will have the opportunity to pay their respects to the monarch who will later address the crowd.
Though Maoist rebels have not directly threatened to disrupt the reception, they have called for a two-day general strike in the region, beginning Saturday, apparently to prevent people from traveling to Pokhara, nearly 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting since February 1996 to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,000 lives.
But officials were adamant that suitable security arrangements had been made.
""The strike is not going to hamper the rally,"" Home Minister Kamal Thapa told reporters on Saturday.
""Adequate security arrangements have been made to ensure the safety of the participants,"" said Laxya Bahadur Gurung, who organized the rally.
Troops set up road blocks and checked vehicles while residents shut businesses and stayed at home on Saturday.
Authorities were not taking any chances since a massive rebel attack at Beni, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Pokhara, that killed scores of soldiers, civilians and guerrillas last weekend.
Fighting between the rebels and government soldiers has escalated since the insurgents withdrew from a seven-month cease-fire last August after three rounds of peace talks.

 Kathmandu, 27 February: Nepal continues to remain a safe haven for illicit drug trade, despite the enhancement of law enforcement capacity and expertise. Nepal ranks third in order of drug notoriety on cultivation and smuggling.
 And compliance of the International Convention on Psychotropic Substance of 1971 - of which Nepal is a party - is very weak. Customs and border control still remain weak in the country, particularly along the country's border with India.
Kathmandu Post via Nepalnews.com web site in English 28 Feb 03
This is stated in the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a United Nations body, which was released worldwide today.
 Launching the report formally in the capital, National Information Officer of the United Nations Information Centre (UNIC), Ram Babu Shah, said that cultivation and trade of narcotics drugs is gradually on the rise in Nepal.
 Also on the rise, according to him, is the tendency to experiment with synthetic drugs such as ecstasy pills, amphetamine and methamphetamine. ""The trend is particularly alarming among youngsters living in urban areas,"" he added.
 Drug cultivation has been proven to be ""non-profitable to the national economy in the long term,"" yet it is going on in countries like Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Myanmar Burma , Thailand and other countries of East Asia.
 While big-time smugglers and traders, including terrorists, are making big bucks through illicit drug trade, Shah said, ""Farmers are reaping only one per cent of the benefit.""
 A summary of the report, made available to the press today, says that the overwhelming share of the profits made form illicit drug trafficking does not occur in countries where illicit drug crops are cultivated, but in countries where finished products are illegally sold and abused.
 The statement said that this is the first time that the Vienna-based independent expert body, which reviews the global drug situation annually, has focused its attention on the impact of illicit drug cultivation, trade and abuse on overall economic development.
 ""The expert body categorically dispels the myth that drug-trafficking may constitute a route to prosperity by stressing that illicit drug production prevents economic growth and does not lead to sustainable development in the long-term,"" the statement added.

Koirala opposed integrating Maoist fighters into Nepal's army on the grounds that it would ""politicise"" the institution, state-owned media Rising Nepal reported on Wednesday.
""The army is the nation's wing and it should not be politicised,"" Koirala said.
""The Maoist army will not be integrated with the Nepal Army,"" he added.
As part of a peace deal in November 2006 that ended a decades-long civil war by the Maoists to overthrow the monarchy, former rebel fighters have been housed in UN-monitored camps across the impoverished Himalayan country.
But just half of the Maoists' claimed 32,250-strong rebel army are actually former guerrillas, according to the UN, which was asked to count them under the peace deal.
""We're alarmed by the prime minister's remarks. It's a threat to the peace process,"" said Maoist chairman Prachanda in Kathmandu.
As part of a 23-point deal reached between the former rebels and government last month, both sides agreed to form a special committee to look into the integration of ""verified"" Maoist fighters into the army.
The Maoist chief said Koirala's comments were ""against the spirit of the interim constitution and the peace accord"".
""Such comments will only complicate the situation,"" Prachanda warned, adding it could derail assembly polls slated to be held by mid-April to elect a constituent assembly that will draft the country's new constitution.
The ultra-leftists quit the government in September in a row over the future of the monarchy and other issues but returned last month after lawmakers agreed to abolish the centuries-old institution and declare a republic.
However, King Gyanendra will remain on the throne for the time being as the deal between the Maoists and the government to make Nepal a republic will only be put into effect at the first meeting of a new constituent assembly.

Text of report by Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak website on 13 December
[Column by Ibrahim Karagul: ""British Martyr, Muslim Gurkha""]
The British Muslim Forum has begun a nationwide campaign to get Muslim youth to join the British army and go to the front. The campaign's most effective argument is martyrdom! Muslims joining the British army will be sent to the front and if they die there they will become martyrs. The British Muslim Forum gives this assurance to the young people.
We are not in the Second World War. Nazi Germany is not attacking the United Kingdom. Nor is any invasion of Europe being planned in order to crush fascism. The United Kingdom is not under threat. So, on which fronts exactly is martyrdom being given? Where are these youth going to fight? In what cause are they going to become martyrs?
Naturally, they are going to be sent to Afghanistan and Iraq. They are going to fight there. They are going to give up their lives for the legacy of British imperialism. If they die they will be considered martyrs because they died protecting their country, their homeland.
The conferences that are being held are saying this: ""Even if the country you die in while serving in the armed forces is a Muslim country like Iraq or Afghanistan, your death while fighting for the United Kingdom will grant you martyrdom.""
They will come to Iraq. They will kill their Muslim brothers in Basra, Baghdad and Al-Fallujah. They will stop fighting so that they can worship and pray namaz, and they will visit the mosques in the region. They will pray to Allah for victory and martyrdom.
When British army soldier Pakistan-born Jabron Hashimi died in combat last July there was an argument as to whether or not he was a martyr. While Muslim congregations were saying he was not a martyr but a traitor, the British Muslim Forum, which has close to 600 mosques in its membership and is one of the largest Islamic institutions in the United Kingdom, says this: ""He was a martyr because he died fighting for his country. Islam orders that fealty be given to lands on which that person was born and the laws of those lands."" This comment was uttered by Forum Chairman Hurshid Ahmed.
The Forum was one of Prime Minister Tony Blair's greatest supporters after the bombing in London on 7 October, and is the greatest supporting force for the British administration's relations with the Muslim community.
Who has killed hundreds of thousands of Muslims or people in Afghanistan and Iraq? The United States and the United Kingdom. Huge massacres, mass graves, chemical weapons, torture and prison of war camps are whose products? Theirs, of course. Who were these death squads? Those who came to liberate these countries, to civilize them and to make them part of the family of man. Who are their enemies? The Iraqis defending Iraq or the Afghans defending Afghanistan? What are they? Terrorists threatening the Western way of life? A world where victims are terrorists and where killers are the symbol of freedom!
A 20-year old Muslim youth living in the United Kingdom gets up and goes to fight in Afghanistan. What happens? If he dies he is a martyr. If he lives he is a monument to freedom. So, what if the same youth leaves London and goes to Kandahar to join the Muslim Pashtun resistance fighters who are fighting the occupation of their country? Of course, he is a terrorist and is committing crimes against humanity. If he caught the torture and humiliation he would be exposed to are intolerable. Let us remember the fates of Western Muslim youth caught while fighting for the Taleban during the occupation of Afghanistan. An Iraq-born Muslim fighting in the British army in Basra is a hero. The same person is a terrorist if he fights for Iraq's liberation!
Let us ask the British Muslim Forum: Are Muslims who die in Basra defending their country from British occupation martyrs? Or are they pathetic souls who lose their lives because they do not understand Blair's ""liberating"" efforts? Again, let us ask: Are the Indian soldiers who died fighting the Ottomans at Canakkale martyrs? If the answer is ""yes"" then what about those Indians who died fighting the British for the liberation of India? According to Britain, if they died fighting the Ottomans at Canakkale they are martyrs but if they died trying to save their country from British occupation they are terrorists.
In the deserts of the Middle East, in Iraq, in Kanal, in Akabe, in Medina the Arab terrorists fought alongside the British against the Ottoman soldiers and died martyrs. Those resisting the occupation in Anatolia, in North Africa and South Asia were terrorists. But any who died fighting for British imperialism in these lands was a martyr.
The British Muslim Forum, which is dealing out title deeds for martyrdom, is creating a new Gurkha class. Muslim Gurkhas! Like the thousands of Nepalese Gurkhas who fought in the British army and have been doing that army's dirty work si"

    ""The generous contribution of donor nations will help  developing Asia-Pacific countries meet Millennium Development Goal  targets, and bring better opportunities and a brighter future to  people living in the region's poorest nations,"" ADB President  Haruhiko Kuroda said. 
    The ADB's Asian Development Fund (ADF) provides grants and  low-interest loans to the Asia-Pacific's poorest countries, which  are home to some 400 million people living on less than two  dollars a day. 
    The ADF from 2009 to 2012 has seen an increase of over 60  percent from the previous period. 
    A chunk of the fund would be spent on essential infrastructure  including roads, clean water, sanitation and power networks, the  Manila-based bank said. 
    ""ADF support is a major source of assistance for countries like  Nepal, who are in urgent need of resources to help our poorest  citizens,"" said Nepalese Finance Secretary Vidyadhar Mallik. 
    ""We appreciate the generosity of the international donor  community in significantly increasing ADF resources, and  successfully completing ADF negotiations,"" Mallik said. 
    The donations were offered just before the ADB's 41st annual  meeting of the Board of Governors in Madrid. 
    Kuroda, among others, also stressed the support for Asia's  rural areas. 
    ""With child malnutrition still widespread in Asia, and the  global food crisis threatening to reverse the gains nations have  achieved in reducing poverty, support for rural infrastructure and  rural finance is critically important,"" Kuroda said. 
    Future ADF resources were also expected to benefit education  initiatives. 
    ""Education is the key to young persons' advancement and  nations' development, and an investment today pays off many-fold  in the future,"" Kuroda said. 
    Mitigation and climate change are among other issues to be  tackled with  the ADF backing. 
    The ADB is dedicated to reducing poverty in the Asia and  Pacific region through inclusive economic growth, environmentally  sustainable growth and regional integration.

Details of the assault are scant, but this much is known: the insurgents overran about 200 troops camped on a remote mountainside. At least 40 of the soldiers may have been executed. Dozens appear to have fled.
Days after Sunday's attack, the rebels' first major victory in months, the army has retaken the area around Tilli, about 550 kilometers (340 miles) northwest of Katmandu, and rescued some of the troops who fled. But the rebels say they are holding 50 soldiers prisoner, and even Nepalis who support the king say the attack is alarming.
""The king was the last hope for most of us, but if attacks like this continue there will be no future for Nepal,"" said Sharad Thapa, a government worker in the capital. ""This is just terrible.""
King Gyanendra seized power Feb. 1, saying that dismissing the democratically elected government and taking the reins himself was the only way to quash the insurgency. Nearly 12,000 people have been killed since the start of the rebellion in 1996.
The coup was condemned internationally, and major allies Britain, India and the United States suspended military aid.
At home, Nepalis were split - there were few ardent supporters of the stumbling politicians who King Gyanendra had usurped, but many people also distrusted the king.
Militarily, it has produced mixed results. Attacks have dropped in larger towns, but little has changed in the countryside, where the rebels remain in control of large swaths of territory.
Sunday's attack, analysts and opposition leaders say, could seriously weaken the king.
Inderjit Rai, an independent political analyst in Katmandu called it ""a major blow to the government.""
""It proves that security situation is still vulnerable in much of the country,"" he said. ""If the government fails to take control of the security situation then they lose support from all the people.""
""The attack has proved the king's claim of improved security to be nothing but hollow,"" said Ram Sharan Mahat of the Nepali Congress, the country's largest party.
The rebel leader who claims to have led the attack, a man known only as Prabhakar, said on the insurgent's Web site that the victory had ""shaken the enemy,"" and proved that the guerillas could defeat the government on any battlefield. He said 26 rebel fighters were killed in the fighting.
The rebels have a strong presence across much of rural Nepal, particularly in areas where there are few military outposts, and they control much of the isolated mountainous region in the Himalayan nation's northwest and midwest.
While they are believed to have about 20,000 fighters, few observers believe they could defeat the king and take control of the nation.
So far, the king's main political opposition comes from political parties pressing to get back into power - and not a popular movement like the one that forced the previous king, in 1990, to establish a democracy.
Some observers warn, however, that the incessant fighting between the palace and the political parties gives strength to the rebels.
The U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, James Moriarty, said Tuesday that ""the continuing divisions between the Palace and the political parties aid only the Maoists and their plans to turn Nepal into a brutal and anachronistic state.""
""The people want reconciliation. They want peace. The way to achieve peace is with a democratic government united against the Maoist assault on Nepal,"" he said.

Nepal's former Maoist rebels stormed out of the government late on Friday, accusing a rival party of clinging to power despite being defeated in landmark elections in the Himalayan country two months ago.
""Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala must resign to open the way for the formation of a new government,"" senior Maoist official Dinanath Sharma told AFP after the ultra-leftists announced their resignations.
Nepal abolished its monarchy three weeks ago, but the country's two most powerful parties -- the Maoists and the prime minister's Nepali Congress party -- have been unable to reach a deal on power-sharing.
The Maoists, who dominate the new assembly elected in April, say they have the right to lead the government and choose a new president.
They say the wrangling is preventing the assembly from starting work on its chief task of rewriting of Nepal's constitution.
""The constituent assembly has not been able to begin drafting a new constitution because of these power-sharing problems,"" said Sharma.
Nepali Congress officials say Koirala -- regarded by many as the architect of a peace deal that ended a deadly civil war waged by the Maoists and led to the creation of the new republic -- deserves to be Nepal's first president.
""The Maoist decision has shocked us, the political impasse has deepened but that doesn't mean we are out of solutions,"" said Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun Nasingh Khatri Chettri.
The president's role is a crucial one because the person occupying the office is expected to be commander of the armed forces.
""This deadlock is creating uncertainty, but we are always ready to reach a consensus through mutual understanding,"" said Maoist official Sharma.

[Presenter] The leader of the opposition parties has said that the government's ban on mass meetings and rallies is a sign that the government is now unstable. They also said that they will defy the government's orders. Stating that the government was scared of the peaceful rally and protests by the opposition parties, they argued that this was the reason why the government had introduced the prohibitory orders. They also clearly stated that the scheduled mass meeting for 20 January would take place according to schedule.
Meanwhile, professional organizations have said that the government's prohibitory orders will affect the people's right to express and freedom of speech and they have called on the government to immediately retract its decision. 
The government had yesterday imposed a night-time curfew in the capital and other towns across the country in addition to banning public gatherings and mass meetings. The Nepali Congress had said that the government's decision was a sign that it was being defeated. The party appealed to the people to take part in the mass gathering scheduled for 20 January and defy the government's order. They said that the party would fight for democracy, human rights and the people's right to self determination and expression so that the people would never have to fight for them in the future. 
Speaking to party workers at a meeting at the party's headquarters, the vice-president of the party, Sushil Koirala, said the government was showing signs of defeat and called on the people to defy the government's order and take part in the 20 January mass meeting in the capital. The secretary-general of the party, Ram Chandra Poudel, and the spokesperson, Krishna Sitaula, also called on the people to defy the government's prohibitory orders.

"6571",20081111,"Title: China throws Everest torch coverage into doubt.rtf; Date: April 24, 2008 Thursday 7:18 AM GMT; Text: Beijing abruptly closed the door Thursday on most foreign media coverage of the Olympic torch's Mount Everest ascent after journalists raised concerns over safety and reporting curbs in restive Tibet.
The move marks the latest controversy to hit Beijing's grand plans for the Olympic torch, which has become a target for protesters critical of China's crackdown on Tibetan unrest and its human rights record.
China plans to take a special high-altitude Olympic torch to the summit of the world's tallest peak in May, and had invited world media including AFP to cover the event as a triumphal symbol of Beijing's hosting of the Olympics.
But last-minute changes this week by Beijing Olympic officials called for a rapid and tightly controlled two-to-three day trip through riot-hit Tibet to Mount Everest base camp.
The changes raised concerns among journalists about the health impact of ascending too quickly to the camp's elevation of 5,150 metres (16,900 feet).
After foreign media requested further information on the safety concerns, Beijing Olympic Games organisers set a sudden Thursday morning payment deadline for air tickets to the Tibetan capital Lhasa.
The situation descended into farce when the Olympic official tasked with collecting payments refused to accept the fees from organisations including AFP and other international news agencies as he headed to the airport to purchase the tickets.
""I'm sorry, it is too late. I am going to the airport now,"" said Xu Xianhui, a Beijing Games media official.
It was not immediately clear if the refusal to accept payment was part of an official government decision to keep reporters out of Tibet.
Xu said the payment of some foreign media organisations had been accepted but declined specifics.
Olympic organisers were asked to explain the refusal but did not immediately reply.
China has clamped tight control on Tibet following anti-Chinese rioting there last month, and has expelled foreign journalists and tourists from the region.
The Olympic torch relay, now in Australia, has been dogged by protests against China's rule of Tibet and human rights record along its international route.
China has taken steps to ensure no potential disruptions to the Everest summit attempt.
The state-controlled Tibet Daily reported earlier in April ""row upon row"" of tents housing security personnel at base camp. China also has banned other climbing expeditions from its side of the mountain.
Nepalese security forces, meanwhile, have been authorised to use guns against protesters on its side. A US climber was expelled from the mountain on Wednesday after a pro-Tibet banner was found in his backpack, a Nepal tourism official told AFP.
The journalists invited to cover the Everest ascent were to have left Beijing for Lhasa on April 22 to witness the summit attempt in early to mid-May.
However, Beijing Olympic officials postponed the trip on the day of departure, citing weather conditions.
Officials also had said reporters would be brought quickly to Everest but only after the summit attempt had gotten well underway, contrary to original plans, and barred from reporting on anything besides the torch.
Experts say the trip from near sea level to such a high altitude should not be done in less than a week. Otherwise, travellers face an increased risk of debilitating altitude sickness and potentially fatal pulmonary edema.

The bomb was thrown near a convention center in Katmandu, hurting at least one person but not causing any major damage, said Home Ministry spokesman Ekmani Nepal.
The attack came minutes after a rally was held in the area by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a small group that is contesting Thursday's election for a Constituent Assembly that will decide the Himalayan nation's political future.

The election is also the first since communist rebels quit their armed struggled against Nepal's government and joined the political mainstream in a process that began in 2006.
Voters will elect members of the assembly, which besides rewriting the constitution, will decide key issues for Nepal's future political system, such as the level of power granted to the prime minister.
The election is an important part of a peace process under which communist rebels gave up their 10-year revolt against the government in 2006.
The country's major political parties have already decided that Nepal's centuries-old monarchy will be abolished after the election.
Nepal's King Gyanendra seized absolute power in 2005 but was forced to give up his authoritarian rule in 2006 after weeks of pro-democracy protests. He has since lost all his powers and his command of the army.
Nepali Congress, the largest political party in Nepal, organized political rallies and meetings Monday in all the constituencies.
""We have public rallies in all the districts on the last day of campaigning to try to persuade the voters to choose us,"" senior party member Shobhakar Parajuli said.
Their main competitor, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), the former communist rebels, were sending small groups of campaigners from house to house.
""Our plan has been to reach as many doorsteps as possible,"" senior Maoist leader Basanta Man Pun said.
Nepal's election law requires all campaigning to stop two days before an election, though it has been common in the past for parties to defy the law.
The Election Commission announced plans to strictly enforce the ban starting at midnight Monday, barring even newspapers from publishing opinion pieces on the polls.
Security has been stepped up, with thousands of police officers fanning out across the country, the Home Ministry said. The government has hired helicopters to patrol mountainous areas and fly police to trouble spots.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and other international election monitors were to arrive in Katmandu later Monday to observe the voting.

The demonstration by about 3,000 people was limited to the western edge of Katmandu. A police officer said they had orders to allow the protest as long as participants stayed away from the center of the city and did not chant any anti-China slogans.
Police have been breaking up every demonstration by Tibetan exiles since they began almost daily protests on March 10. Nepalese officials have said they cannot allow protests against China.
Nepal has been accused by the United Nations and human rights groups of using excessive force in stopping the protests. Police have beaten participants with batons, fired tear gas and detained hundreds of people.
The protesters marched Monday to the United Nations' human rights office, where they handed a statement to officials asking the world body to investigate killings and other alleged violations of human rights in Tibet.
Doma Tsomo, one of the demonstrators who delivered the statement, said U.N. officials gave assurances the request would be conveyed to U.N. headquarters.
Thousands of Tibetan refugees live in Nepal, a key route for Tibetans fleeing Chinese rule.

""The government should seriously focus its attention on ecotourism in view of its high development potential,"" said the chairman of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), Ang Tsering Sherpa.
""As Nepal's vast rural areas are rugged mountain terrains endowed with scenic beauty they hold out good prospects for the development of ecotourism,"" added Suman Pandey, chairman of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal (TAAN).
""If ecotourism is promoted in those places it will contribute significantly to poverty alleviation,"" he told an Eco-Trekking Workshop and Adventure Meeting organised by TAAN in Kathmandu.
Tek Bahadur Dangi, executive director of the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB), said Nepal's earnings from tourism represented 17 percent of total national earnings.
""Tourism is one of Nepal's important foreign exchange spinners. Last year, a total of 492,000 tourists visited Nepal and its earning from the tourism sector was estimated at 167 million dollars,"" he said. The figure does not include earnings from Indian tourists.
But tourism here is facing an uphill battle. The number of tourists, after reaching its highest level in 1999, dropped last year by close to 60 percent from 500,000 to 215,000, according to official figures.
Besides a Maoist insurgency, tourism has been dampened by a 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and the shocking massacre of the royal family in 2001.
Officials also attribute the fall to factors outside Nepal, including the slowdown of the global economy, the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Iraq war and the SARS outbreak in Asia.
But government officials said after massive publicity from celebrations marking the golden jubilee of the first ascent of Everest by Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Norgay Tenzing on May 29, 1953, they were planning further promotions.
""The government is planning to launch a promotional drive about rural areas of scenic beauty as well as their infrastructural development,"" said Shanker Koirala, undersecretary at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
He repeated a government proposal that within the next two years all Himalayan peaks in the kingdom will be opened for climbers.
""The tourism industry could thrive if the country's political situation improves and the government formulates a good tourism policy,"" Sherpa said.

 Reports from far-western district of Kanchanpur say security forces have repulsed a major Maoist attack at the security base of the Armed Police Force (APF) at Gadda Chowki and a customs post near Nepal-India border in the far-western region on Monday [30 May].
 According to reports, hundreds of Maoist insurgents arrived at the APF security base at around 7.30 p.m. [local time] on tractors and opened fire from three or four positions simultaneously.
Nepalnews.com website, Kathmandu, in English 31 May 05The insurgents left after nearly three-hour long gun battle.
 A Mahendranagar-based journalist, who visited the site of clashes Tuesday morning, told Nepalnews over phone that bodies of a security personnel and a Maoist rebel have been recovered from the site of the encounter. He said empty bullet covers were scattered around the area and people were still terrified.
 Gadda Chowki is a bordering custom point, four km west from Mahendranagar - a major business centre in the far-western region. SSB [Special Services Bureau ] security personnel from India were deployed only a kilometre away from Gadda Chowki in the Indian territory and were on alert, reports said.
 The rebels had erected barriers along the Mahendra highway before staging attack at the security base. Security sources said there have been heavy casualty on the part of the rebels and that they took away bodies of at least half a dozen their fallen comrades along with them. Security sources said the rebels had gathered at Jimuwa, the northern part of Kanchanpur district, near Churia forest, before travelling to the south. Senior security officials in Kathmandu confirmed the clashes at Gadda Chowki but said they were still awaiting for details.

The fate of those abducted wasn't immediately clear, but victims of such kidnappings are usually released after spending a few days being lectured about the rebels' struggle to overthrow Nepal's constitutional monarchy.
At least 230 students and teachers were taken Sunday from in and around the village of Himchadhari in the Accham district, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of Katmandu, the army said in a statement.
The rebels kidnapped another 200 people in Gaira village in neighboring Doti district at the weekend, as well as 300 students and teachers from several villages in the remote mountains of Baitadi district to the south, the statement said.
""The terrorists are continuing murder, terror, kidnapping, looting and similar activities,"" the army said.
The Maoist rebels did not immediately respond to the army's statement.
The mass abductions came despite a promise from the guerrillas that they would not go after civilians during a unilateral cease-fire they declared earlier this month.
The rebels announced the cease-fire on Sept. 3, a move they said was intended to allow for a resumption of peace talks aimed at ending the nearly decade-long war in the Himalayan kingdom. The insurgents said they would defend their positions during the cease-fire but not attack any government officials or civilians.
However, human rights groups have accused the insurgents of taking hostages, and the abductions, a long common occurrence, are the latest sign that little has changed for the vast majority of Nepalese, despite the cease-fire.
In fresh unrest over the weekend, the army said soldiers killed at least eight rebels in two separate incidents - the first reported violence since the cease-fire was announced.
The rebels claimed their fighters were arrested and then executed while the army said soldiers on patrol came under attack and the rebels were killed in ensuing gun battles.
Rebel violence in Nepal has escalated since King Gyanendra seized control of the government in February. The king said the measure was necessary to quell the communist insurgency, which has left more than 11,500 people dead since 1996.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, declared cease-fires in 2001 and 2003, but negotiations with the government failed both times.

The policemen were handed over to human rights activists and were in good health after their two weeks in captivity, a government official said by telephone, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
On April 5, a rebel attack on government buildings and security bases in Malangawa, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, Katmandu, left six policemen, five rebels and two civilians dead.
Another 10 people died when a military helicopter deployed to help fight the insurgents crashed in the area, killing all crew and soldiers on board.
The Royal Nepalese Army said the Russian-built MI-17 helicopter crashed because of technical problems, but the rebels said they shot down the aircraft, and celebrated it as a victory in their decade-long rebellion.
The rebels have escalated attacks against government targets since withdrawing from a unilateral cease-fire earlier this year.
The rebels, who claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, began their violent campaign to replace the monarchy with a communist state in 1996. The insurgency has left more than 13,000 dead.

""We need to deal with the lifting of the embargo -- sea, land and air -- which for the Lebanese is a humiliation,"" Annan said before wrapping up a two-day visit to Lebanon.
""And of course the (Lebanese) government needs measures to assure, ensure that the entrances (to) the country -- sea, land and air -- are secure,"" he added at the UN headquarters in the southern port of Naqura.
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said: ""The naval blockade is to prevent rearmament of Hezbollah.
""The moment when the international community, Germany, Denmark and the others, will reinforce the arms embargo from the sea side, it will be the moment when we can open it,"" she told a news conference in Copenhagen.
Israel is maintaining its blockade despite an August 14 ceasefire that ended its devastating month-long offensive.
Annan arrived in Israel on the second leg of his Middle East tour to strengthen the fragile truce, after viewing destruction in southern Lebanon wrought by the war between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.
He met Defence Minister Amir Peretz, who said that Israeli forces will remain in south Lebanon for several more weeks and will leave once the expanded UN peacekeeping force foreseen by the Security Council truce resolution begins deploying in numbers.
Israel forces ""will remain for several weeks, no longer than that,"" Peretz told reporters after the meeting.
""As far as we are concerned, the desire to leave southern Lebanon is that of the state of Israel and will happen immediately after (international) forces arrive in reasonable numbers,"" he said.
Annan said he expected a swift doubling in size of the existing UN force which the truce resolution foresees swelling to an eventual 15,000 personnel.
""We should be able to double relatively quickly the 2,500 men we have on the ground and move up to 5,000"" so that the Israelis can move back to the international border, he said.
Before his talks with Peretz, Annan met the families of three captive Israeli soldiers, two of whom were seized by Hezbollah on July 12 sparking the Lebanon war, and the third by Gaza militants in late June.
Hezbollah has demanded the release of Arab prisoners in Israeli jails in return for the two soldiers it holds, and although the Jewish state has insisted on an unconditional release, local media have reported that talks over a potential prisoner swap are under way.
Annan had earlier flown along the volatile border between Lebanon and Israel, after being briefed by UN commanders in Naqura, the main arrival point for the peacekeeping reinforcements.
France, which currently leads the UN force, said a 900-strong battalion armed with battle tanks and heavy artillery would deploy in south Lebanon by mid-September, while five warships left Italy to spearhead Rome's contribution.
Italy aims to deploy 2,450 ground troops in two phases over four months. Rome's will be the largest contribution to the international force, which Italy will command from March next year.
Nepal became the latest country to pledge a contingent for the expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), saying on Tuesday it will send 850 troops.
The Turkish government will recall parliament early from summer recess next week to vote on sending troops.
Turkish press reports said Ankara could send between 600 and 1,200 troops.
In Beirut on Monday, Annan called for the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, including an Israeli withdrawal in tandem with the deployment of Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers.
""It is a fixed menu, it's not a buffet, it's not a smorgasbord, it's not an a la carte menu where you choose and pick,"" he said. ""We are entering the stage of recovery and reconstruction, we have a chance to have a long-term ceasefire.""
Much of south Lebanon lies in ruins following the offensive that killed at least 1,287 people in Lebanon, nearly all of them civilians, as well as 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.
A Lebanon donors' conference will be held in Sweden on Thursday, aiming to raise 500 million dollars (392 million euros) for the country's immediate humanitarian and reconstruction needs.
On Wednesday, Annan is to meet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and other top officials in Jerusalem, and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
He is due to leave Israel on Wednesday afternoon for Jordan.

Swirling fog forced state-run railways to suspend as many as 11 trains Monday, stranding over 8,000 passengers across northern India, he said, adding that services were also running way behind schedule Tuesday.
""Most trains leading to New Delhi are regularly being cancelled as they are arriving 16-20 hours late,"" said a spokesman for Indian railways.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, recorded its lowest temperature this winter of 4.9 degrees Celsius (40.8 Fahrenheit) Tuesday as temperatures dropped across the country, a government meteorologist said.
The cold spell, one of the worst for tropical Bangladesh, has killed almost 700 people. There are no official government figures.
Most of the dead have been poor, elderly or young, those least prepared for the frigid weather.
Weather in Nepal brought some cheer Tuesday as the mercury soared and meteorologists declared that the worst of the cold wave -- which has claimed 80 lives in the Himalayan kingdom -- was over.

The appointments announced by the royal palace were the king's third overhaul of his Cabinet since he seized absolute power in February, ousting a previous government and imposing tight controls on dissidence.
The king had asked the country's main political parties to offer candidates to join his Cabinet. But the parties all refused because they oppose the king's direct control over the government and instead organized street protests to demand that he restore democracy.
The 12 new ministers and junior ministers announced Friday are all known supporters of the king.
""This indicates the king is going to do what he pleases, and he will not try to reconcile with the political parties,"" said Arjun Narsingh, Nepali Congress party spokesman.
The new ministers include people who were key players in trying to crush a popular movement in 1990 that forced the previous king to establish parliamentary democracy, said Raghuji Pant of the Communist Party of Nepal.
""The king is trying to show that he will not bow down to pressure. It shows that the king is going to force through with his direct rule,"" Pant said.
Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal and country's five other major parties have formed an alliance to try force the king to roll back his takeover of the government in this Himalayan country.
The king said he needed the expanded authority to fight the country's Maoist insurgency and control corruption among the politicians. Foreign governments have decried his move as a setback for democracy.
Among the newly named Cabinet members are former Home Minister Niranjan Thapa, who played a key role in trying to put down the deadly 1990 revolt. He was named the new law and justice minister.
Prakash Koirala, who was expelled from Nepali Congress party for his open support for the king, was given the post of minister for environment, science and technology.
Other party defectors like Salim Ansari, Binod Kumar Shah and Golche Sarki also have been included in the royal government.

"6215",20073563,"Title: Southern Nepal clashes leave 19 dead, hundreds wounded.rtf; Date: September 20, 2007 Thursday 7:54 AM GMT; Text: The death toll from weekend riots in southern Nepal rose Thursday to 19 as police reached remote areas affected by the bloodshed and found more bodies, officials said.
The fighting in the Kapilbastu district ignited after gunmen killed a local politician Sunday in Chandrauta village, 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Katmandu, said the chief administrator Narendra Dahal.
The death toll jumped from three to 19 after police reached remote villages on Wednesday and Thursday. Dahal said more bodies may be found as police continued to search the district for missing people.
Hundreds of people were wounded and scores of homes and vehicles were damaged in the riots, prompting authorities to impose a curfew. Dahal said it was still in effect in some areas of the district to prevent further violence.
Police were investigating which groups were involved in the fighting, he said.
Rioting began after local politician Mohit Khan was gunned down Sunday. Khan had headed a vigilante group formed to counter communist rebel attacks two years ago when King Gyanendra directly ruled this Himalayan nation and government troops were fighting the guerrillas.
The Maoist rebels gave up their armed revolt and joined a peace process with Nepal's government last year.
Khan's supporters allege the Maoists were responsible for his death, but the communists have denied any involvement.
A police chief in the area, Sashi Silwal, said hundreds of policemen were deployed to halt any new rioting. Buses and other vehicles on highways were being escorted by police.
Violence in southern Nepal has killed at least 90 people this year.
Several ethnic groups have been organizing strikes, transportation shutdowns and demonstrations to demand greater rights. They include a handful of small armed groups, who sometimes fight among themselves as they compete for residents' support.
Many southerners say their region has been sidelined in favor of the more populated, mountainous north. They are demanding greater autonomy, more seats in the national legislature and a guaranteed number of representatives in the administration.
A team from the U.N. human rights office was also in the area investigating the deadly riots, said spokesman Marty Logan. He said a U.N. report on the rioting and number of deaths would be released after the probe was complete.

"4987",20062606,"Title: Report_ Poacher traded skins of 725 endangered animals, including 40 tigers.rtf; Date: June 7, 2006 Wednesday 11:53 AM GMT; Text: Authorities investigating India's most notorious alleged wildlife smuggler say there's he killed around 726 endangered animals, including tigers and leopards, in his 31-year career trading their pelts and bones, a newspaper reported Monday.
Sansar Chand was arrested nearly a year ago, but investigators are only just unraveling the extent of his alleged activities and his reportedly prominent role in the disappearance of tigers and other big cats from wildlife reserves, the Hindustan Times said.
Last week, investigators filed criminal charges against Chand in a New Delhi court, using as evidence a diary that he had maintained since 1974 to keep track of the animals he allegedly killed.
G. Mohanty, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Investigation India's equivalent of the FBI on Wednesday confirmed the diary had been used by prosecutors to charge Chand, but could not provide details of its contents.
But the Hindustan Times reported that Chand's diary had abbreviations for the animals he killed. Among those he recorded hunting were some 40 tigers and 654 leopards. It's illegal to hunt either of the cats in India, where both are endangered.
Police accuse Chand of leading a gang that smuggled skins, bones and other animal parts across the Nepalese border and into China, where they are used in traditional medicine. Along with the parts of animals he killed, Chand is also alleged to have bought skins from other poachers.
Poaching has decimated India's big cat populations. Estimates of number of tigers left in the wild range from 2,000 to 7,000, with about half in India.

 New Delhi, 12 November: India's Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy on Thursday 11 November said the Marxist-Maoist movement may one day threaten the region's security ""vertically down from Nepal to Andhra Pradesh"" in south India.
 ""We need to orientate, equip and train to fight terrorism in all the three spheres - land, sea and air,"" he said during a lecture organized by Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. ""Today, the (Indian) air force machines and crew are optimized to support counter insurgency operations.""
 According to him, the Indian air force, which has excellent ties with the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), has developed ""flexible command and control means - such as UAVs and other sensors - for enhanced effectiveness"". ""Our force,"" he added, ""would continually train and upgrade its equipment to combat terrorism, the scourge of this decade"".
Kathmandu Post via Kantipuronline.com web site in English 13 Nov 04
Later, Krishnaswamy told the Post that the Indian Air Force and RNA were working together to fight terrorism in the region. The Indian army has provided training and military assistance - such as Advanced Light, Cheetah and Chetak helicopters - to the RNA. ""We have excellent ties and good cooperation (with RNA), and it will continue,"" he said.
 Threats to India's internal security, he added, emanate primarily from ""unsettled"" and ""soft"" border problems. Besides the world headlines making disputed Line of Control between India and Pakistan, India has unsettled border problems with Bangladesh and China; and soft border problems with Nepal and Myanmar Burma , according to him.
 In another development, New Delhi's special task force of parliamentarians, CTFN (Centre's Task Force of Naxalism), has pointed out that the recent merger of Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and People's War Group (PWG) could ""amplify"" Maoist-related violence across the region.
 According to Indian Home Ministry's ""initial analysis"", there are clear linkages between Indian Naxalite groups and Nepali Maoists (CPN-M Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist ). ""CPN-M has increased its activities in the terai plains region of Nepal bordering India,"" it said, and added that there was ""regular exchange of men and material"" between the Nepali and Indian Maoists.
 The development comes as New Delhi urges Andhra Pradesh government - which is looking forward to its second round of talks with Maoist rebels there - and other Maoist-affected states to strengthen their intelligence and policing mechanism to check open Maoist activities such as mass meetings.

"7706",20115050,"Title: Storm brews in UML over Khanal's move.rtf; Date: August 6, 2011 Saturday; Text: KATHMANDU: Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman Jhala Nath Khanal came under attack today at the party's Central committee meeting with some CC members demanding that Khanal be barred from chairing the meeting as he faced the allegation that he had disregarded the party's decision.
The UML central disciplinary commission too, had said last Tuesday, that Khanal had violated the party decision by reshuffling his cabinet on August 1.
Today's meeting lasted for three hours as Khanal was unwell. The next meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday. Khanal did not present any document at today's meeting, which was called to discuss the upcoming meeting of the National Representative Council, scheduled for September 16 to 18, and a host of other political issues.
Before the meeting kicked off, some CC members loyal to the KP Oli-Madhav Nepal faction, including Raghuji Pant, Krishna Gopal Shrestha, Khagaraj Adhikari, Guru Baral, Agni Kharel and Mahendra Pandey argued that Khanal should not chair the CC meeting as ""he had been accused of violating the party's standing committee decisions of July 26, 28 and August 1. But Minister without portfolio Ghanshyam Bhusal defended Khanal saying that he had the right to chair the meeting as the allegation was yet to be proved. Vice-chairperson Bidhya Devi Bhandari said the three secretaries - Bishnu Poudel, Shankar Pokharel and Yuvaraj Gyawali - had shed-light on a series of standing committee decisions that Khanal had violated, the copies of the decisions were distributed to all CC members.
The three secretaries, according to some CC members, alleged that Khanal had ignored the party's decisions by inducting a new team of ministers from the UCPN-Maoist in his cabinet.
""It was wrong on Khanal's part to call the standing committee meeting when he had already set the stage for swearing in the new ministers,"" Karna Thapa, another CC member, quoted secretary Gyawali.
CC member Krishna Gopal Shrestha said the three standing committee meetings, chaired by Khanal himself, had decided not to reshuffle the cabinet and to hold the CC meeting on August 21 to discuss formation of unity government. The meetings had also decided that the PM did not have to step down pro-tem.
But, according to CC member Yogesh Bhattarai, who is close to Khanal, Vice-chairman Bamdev Gautam, and Bhusal, no decision had been taken at the standing committee meeting on August 1 as the ""party chairman had left the meeting after adjourning it"".
Gautam defended Khanal's cabinet reshuffle, saying it was his prerogative and an issue between the PM and UCPN-Maoist, which deemed it necessary to send its new team to the cabinet.

"912",20031820,"Title: U.N. Votes to Expand Force in Congo.rtf; Date: July 28, 2003 Monday; Text: In a fresh attempt to bring peace to Congo, the Security Council voted Monday to strengthen the U.N. military presence and impose an arms embargo on rival factions in the resource-rich east.
The council's unanimously resolution will increase the U.N. peacekeeping force from 8,700 to 10,800 troops, a move welcomed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
The additional troops would replace an emergency French-led international force sent to Bunia, in northeastern Congo, to reinforce 750 U.N. troops and stem fighting between rival tribal factions.
The French-led international force of 1,500 troops is scheduled to leave by Sept. 1.
A multinational force of 3,000 troops from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal is expected to be in Bunia by the end of September.
The multinational force is expected to gradually expand its operations into the volatile surrounding Ituri region.
""This resolution will allow the United Nations to have a more forceful and flexible presence in the Congo, particularly in the eastern part of the country,"" said U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte.
France and many African nations had backed Annan's call for a larger, more robust U.N. force, but the United States had been reluctant. During President Bush's trip to Africa earlier this month, however, Washington said it would support the increase.
Under the previous mandate, U.N. troops were only allowed to fire in self-defense. The French-led force is authorized to shoot to kill, but only in Bunia.
The new resolution authorizes the U.N. force to protect U.N. personnel and facilities, protect civilians and humanitarian workers ""under imminent threat of physical violence,"" and help improve security conditions so humanitarian aid can be provided.
It authorizes the U.N. force ""to use all necessary means"" to fulfill its mandate in Ituri, and in North and South Kivu in eastern Congo - the scene of continuing violence.
In the past, the Security Council has called on neighboring countries and other nations to stop supplying the weapons that have fueled the five-year-old conflict.
On Monday, the council went a step further, banning the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment in the region ""to all foreign and Congolese armed groups and militias operating in the territory of North and South Kivu and of Ituri"" and to all groups that did not sign the peace agreement in Congo.
The resolution appears to be targeting the heavily armed tribal fighters in Ituri as well as Rwandan and Burundian rebels whose operations in eastern Congo are threatening to derail the peace process.
Since a 1999 cease-fire, foreign troops have withdrawn from Congo and most fighting has stopped, except in the east. Conflict erupted in August 1998, when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into the country to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila.
Congo's president Joseph Kabila, his son, signed a decree on June 30 that established a power-sharing administration of rebels and the government.

"7702",20117795,"Title: Uncle held for abduction of boy.rtf; Date: September 14, 2011 Wednesday; Text: PALPA, Sept. 14 -- Police have arrested the uncle of Kishore Neupane, who was abducted on August 7, on the suspicion of his involvement in the abduction of his nephew.
Palpa Police arrested Jageshwor Neupane on Wednesday after investigations revealed his involvement in the case. Police had arrested Jageshwor earlier but released him two weeks ago with the condition to mark his attendance daily at the District Police Office after the family told the police that a hasty arrest of a relative would vitiate the family atmosphere.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Govinda Thapaliya said the accused was released as the police had not been able to find any evidence against him other than trying to destroy phone call records. ""On top of that the victim's father himself had been the guarantor for the release of the accused. We have again arrested him after finding additional evidence against him,"" DSP Thapaliya said refusing to divulge the details about the new evidence as the investigations are ongoing.
The conversation with abductors about ransom was recorded on father Ram Prasad's cell phone but his brother Jageshwor had vanished with the mobile set just five minutes after the conversation was recorded. He was later found along with the set while the abductors, who had been regularly calling for ransom, has not called even once in over one month after the conversation was recorded. The status of the 17-year-old is not known yet.
""We were in a tight spot as the family had not lodged a formal complaint against anyone and had also requested to wait for a few days considering the safety of the boy,"" DSP Thapaliya explained.
The boy's father conceded that there are enough evidences to suspect his brother. Maternal uncle Shankar Basyal added that the family has reached the conclusion that Jageshwor was involved in the case. ""We had suspicion earlier but we thought the boy will be released. He had said that he took the mobile to play the recording to the DSP and inspector but we subsequently found that he didn't go to the police,"" Basyal said.

 Thousands of people displaced by the Maoist insurgency in eastern parts of Nepal are living in hardships as there is lack of adequate food, drinking water, education and health services. More than 1,000 families from Morang, Sunsari, Terhathum, Jhapa, Panchthar, Taplejung, Dhankuta, Sankhuwasabha and Ilam districts have been living at a shelter of Kirat indigenous people of eastern Nepal priest Atmananda, located at Banjo. They fled their homes and villages after Maoists intensified their terror, looting, extortion and demanded either money of man as published, presumably ""or men"" .

The number of people taking asylum here is increasing day by day. ""We fear a breakout of an epidemic in the areas owing to poor sanitation,"" said Kehar Singh Yonjan, chairman of Kirat Cholung Mangena Sewa Samiti.
 Yonjan said that displaced people were pouring in here in the hope that it is a safe place for them. ""The Maoists have been unable to attack the shelter after the disciples of Kirat religion handed over some of the influential Maoist workers to the administration after successfully retaliating their assault in the past,"" he said.
 Some of the people have abandoned their land and cattle after the Maoists issued threat to finish off their whole families if they failed to meet their demands of food grain and cash, said a person on condition of anonymity.  passage omitted
 Phalgunananda health clinic, the only health post in the village, has been unable to provide health services to the displaced families.
 ""We are unable to bear the burden of rising number of children in the school because of limited resources and manpower,"" said Mukti Sangwa, headmaster of Saraswoti Secondary School. More than 1,500 students have been in the school, which had only 150 students a year ago.

The court issued the order after hearing a legal challenge against the July convictions of Deuba and cabinet colleague Prakash Man Singh.
Both men were sentenced to two years in prison by the Royal Commission for Corruption Control and fined 90 million rupees (1.26 million dollars).
""The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Dilip Kumar Paudyel, ordered the Royal Commission for Corruption Control to explain within seven days the reason why the ex-premier and his party colleague had been detained,"" a court official said.
Lawyers Binod Karki and Sarbagya Raj Nayo had earlier told the supreme court that the anti-graft commission was unconstitutional and the convictions should be thrown out.

Advani on Friday called on visiting Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, and expressed concern over growing Maoist influence in the Himalayan country. 
  Advani, however, welcomed the ongoing dialogue between Nepal Government and Maoists, but said the outcome of their talks should not threaten India's internal security.
  He said the Maoist menace in India had achieved dangerous proportions and it should not gain further from the recent developments in Nepal.
  ""The Naxalite problem, starting from Nepal's border and extending as far as southern Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, has become a grave concern for us. If you (Nepal) are talking to Maoists, we do not have any problem. But the outcome of your talks should not hit India, it should not pose a problem for India's internal security,"" Advani told reporters after meeting Koirala.
  BJP has been cautioning the Centre against the increasing influence of Maoists in Nepal.
  New Delhi, which played a significant role in establishing talks between the Maoists and Koirala government, though, is concerned about links between the Nepali rebels and growing numbers of Indian Maoist insurgents on its side of the porous border between the two countries.
  The Maoists and the new government have agreed to hold elections for a special assembly to prepare a new constitution that would decide the future of the monarchy.

"7061",2008561,"Title: Sherpa in bid to conquer Everest for 18th time.rtf; Date: May 11, 2008 Sunday 1:56 AM GMT; Text: A Sherpa aiming to conquer Everest for the 18th time and septuagenarians battling for the title of oldest climber to reach the summit are lining up their record bids as the main climbing season opens.
Nepal this week lifted a climbing ban imposed to prevent pro-Tibet protests on the roof of the world as the Chinese Olympic torch was carried up the northern approach to the mountain from Tibet.
The main season for climbing the world's highest peak is expected to open towards the end of this month and hundreds of mountaineers, support staff and paying clients from 32 expeditions are now acclimatising for the final push.
""Now because of climate change, the season is shifting later and later. This year we expect the good weather window might open around the third week of May,"" said Ang Tsering Sherpa, chairman of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an expedition organiser.
With a breathtaking 17 summits of the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) peak already under his belt, Apa Sherpa looks likely to get to the top again, said chairman Ang Tsering.
""I think Apa has a good chance. He is physically very, very fit and as long as the weather permits, he will break his own record,"" he said.
Last year, retired Japanese school teacher Katsusuke Yanagisawa -- 71 years and two months old when he reached the summit -- became the oldest man to conquer the peak. This year two men are trying to beat the record.
His countryman, 75-year-old adventurer Yuichiro Miura is currently at base camp struggling with acclimatisation -- a process of making short trips up and down the lower reaches of the mountain to prepare climbers for the ""death zone"" above 8,000 metres, where there is just a third of the oxygen present at sea level.
""I was tired all day yesterday,"" Miura wrote on his expedition website Friday.
""But then I remembered it was the same situation as when I was 70 years old, but I feel even more tired now than when I was here when I was 70,"" said Miura, who won international fame in 1970 when he became the first person to ski down the South Col of Mount Everest, using a parachute as a brake.
Despite his previous Himalayan exploits -- which also include clinching the record for the world's oldest person atop Everest in 2003 -- Miura is up against stiff competition in 77-year-old Nepalese Min Bahadur Sherchan.
Sherchan is a former British Gurkha -- soldiers who have been part of the British army for nearly 200 years -- and was a government mountaineering liaison officer with years of experience of high peaks.
""When I last spoke with him he said he is feeling in very good condition,"" Ramjindaji Gurung, coordinator of Sherchan's Senior Citizen Mount Everest Expedition, told AFP.
""He has been going up and down between camps one and two to acclimatise and will be making a start for the summit in the next few days,"" Gurung said.
Last year 557 people -- 254 via Nepal and 303 via Tibet -- reached the highest point on earth, which was a record.
This year the only expedition allowed on the approach through Tibet so far has been the Olympic torch team, so the number is expected to be significantly lower.

  The serial explosions in the capital had killed three people, including two students and a housewife. The charge carries a punishment of life imprisonment and a fine.
  The Election Commission (EC) has expressed surprise at Singh's victory in the election, and is likely to take a decision on Tuesday on whether to disqualify his victory or not. Singh won the election fighting as an independent candidate.
  Singh is also reportedly wanted in Bihar for several crimes. He is reportedly associated with two insurgent groups - the Nepal Peoples' Army and the Terai Army.
  ""We are looking in to the matter,"" EC spokesperson Laxman Bhattarai said.
  Four of Singh's associates - Jagat Narayan Sharma, Sanjeev Sah, Upendra Sah, and Ram Lakhan Sharma - are behind bars in Kathmandu's central jail, and have reconfirmed Singh's involvement in the crime.
  The Maoists on Monday continued their winning spree in the Constituent Assembly elections. Out of the 195 seats declared, the Maoists have won 110 seats, and are leading in 15 constituencies, the EC official said.
  The Nepali Congress has won 30 seats, and are leading in five more while the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) won 24 seats. The counting for the 239 seats under the first-past-the-post system is likely to be completed on Tuesday, the official said, adding that the counting for the proportional system would begin on Tuesday afternoon.
  The official also said the process of counting would be completed by April 22 to allow the quick formation of the new government. Even after winning a majority, the Maoists are open to forming a coalition government, the leaders said, adding that cooperation of all the parties is required to write the new constitution.
  However, UML leaders claimed they would not like to be part of the new government as they have lost the elections. Few other members of the ruling Seven Party Alliance (SPA) may join the new government.
  The Maoist cadres are still celebrating their victory across the country. ""But, we are very careful as the regressive forces could try to disrupt the internal security situation,"" senior Maoist leader C.P. Gajurel, said.

""We have been maintaining informal contacts and holding discussions with the Maoist negotiators for the third round of the peace dialogue,"" Thapa told a press conference.
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire on January 29 and have held two rounds of talks aimed at ending seven years of insurgency that have cost more than 7,800 lives.
Since the last round of talks Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand resigned after protests from political parties over his appointment in October by King Gyanendra.
The king appointed Surya Bahadur Thapa as premier and he, earlier this month, announced a two-member negotiating team that included Kamal Thapa.
""We will be honouring the outcome of the peace talks held during the former government,"" Thapa said.
""The top priority of the present government is to resolve the problem with the Maoists and help restore peace and security.""
Last week, seven Maoists and a civilian were killed in a gunfight between rebels and the army -- the deadliest clash since the two sides entered into the ceasefire.
""It is regrettable that people lost their lives in the clashes. The Maoists attacked the Royal Army medical and social service team and the army had to shoot in self defence,"" Thapa said.
The main political parties were furious when the king sacked the elected prime minister, replaced him with Chand and postponed elections.
They have been holding protests and have said they will not cooperate with the new government.
""We will be making further efforts for the support of the opposition,"" Thapa said.
Thapa welcomed the visit by Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to China, which began Sunday.
""Both India and China are Nepal's close and good friendly neighbours.
""We hope the Indian prime minister's visit to Beijing and his talks with the Chinese leaders will help develop China and India's friendly relationship.""

 The government on Tuesday 2 November has said it has asked Royal Nepalese embassies in the Middle East to try to find out whereabouts of the Nepali citizen who was one of the eight persons taken hostage in Baghdad by an Iraqi insurgent group on Monday, and ensure his release.
 The government has also appealed to the group that has taken the Nepali citizen hostage to free him immediately and not to harm him.
 The government move came within hours of news reports that one of the persons taken hostage in Iraq was a Nepali security guard serving at the Saudi Arabian Trading and Contracting Company in the Mansur district of Baghdad.
Nepalnews.com web site, Kathmandu, in English 2 Nov 04
The identity of the Nepali national taken hostage by the Iraqis is yet to be ascertained, Foreign Ministry officials said.
 Spokesperson at the Foreign Ministry Durga Prasad Bhattarai told reporters that the government was trying to collect details about the person. ""We have instructed our missions in the Middle East to take immediate measures to get him freed,"" he added.
 Nepal doesn't have diplomatic relations with Iraq and has imposed ban on the Nepalis to go and work in the war-ravaged country. Reports, however, say hundreds of Nepalis have sneaked into Iraq from nearby countries and continue to work their risking their lives.
 Of the eight captured men, five were Iraqis, one was Nepali, one American and one Filipino. Two of the Iraqis were later released.
 The government had faced severe criticism after it failed to contact the insurgent group, Al-Ansar al-Sunnah, that had kidnapped a group of 12 Nepalis who had entered Iraq to work there. The brutal killing of the innocent Nepalis by the group in late August sparked violent protests in the capital, Kathmandu, on 1 September.
 An angry mob, said to have been infiltrated by agent provocateurs, had targeted and rampaged hundreds of offices of manpower agencies, media houses, mosques and GSA general sales agent offices of foreign airlines. Two persons were killed and the government had to impose curfew for several days to bring the situation under control.
 The government-formed commission to probe into the incident is yet to submit its report.

Demonstrators were marching toward Katmandu from several directions, and thousands of people protested just outside the curfew area in the suburb of Gangabu, watched by a line of police and soldiers.
District administration officers said the 2 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew was necessary to prevent opposition parties from holding a huge rally, planned for Thursday, to demand that King Gyanendra loosen his grip on power.
Residents in parts of central Katmandu came out onto their roofs, whistling and banging plates. People used mobile phones to call each other and send text messages, trying to draw each other out for demonstrations.
""We are ready to sacrifice our lives for the nation because we are about to be killed, but we are not concerned about that. It is for the nation and without the nation there is no life,"" said Sangam Poudel, a 22-year-old student.
Security forces had orders to shoot curfew violators on sight. Diplomats, journalists and human rights monitors were not issued passes allowing them onto the streets as they had been in the past.
Police tried to keep media and rights workers away from any protests, escorting some foreign journalists back to their hotels.
A foreign diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the restriction on passes was intended to keep observers journalists, rights activists and diplomats from seeing what was going on in the streets.
Still, opposition leaders met on Thursday and decided to go ahead with the protest.
Krishna Sitaula of the Nepali Congress party said there would be rallies at Katmandu's major entry points, where protesters would try to break through police lines.
About 5,000 protesters rallied in Kirtipur, just southwest of Katmandu, on Thursday morning, local resident Arun Giri said by telephone. There is no curfew in the farming suburb.
Gyanendra, meanwhile, met with a special envoy sent by neighboring India at the royal palace in the heart of Katmandu, state-run Nepal television said.
Karan Singh was in the palace for two hours, according to the report. Details of the meeting were not immediately available.
India, a burgeoning global power that does not want chaos on its doorstep, sent Singh on Wednesday to press the king to reach a compromise with the parties. The parties want a new constitution that would limit or eliminate the monarchy's role.
Before meeting the king, Singh met several opposition leaders.
Two weeks of often violent protests and a general strike against palace rule have paralyzed the Himalayan country, leaving cities short of food and fuel and Nepal at its most volatile since King Gyanendra seized power 14 months ago.
The royal government has responded harshly, claiming that communist insurgents now allied with the opposition have infiltrated rallies to instigate violence. Police have beaten, tear gassed and arrested thousands of protesters.
Security forces have killed at least 10 people, including some pro-democracy protesters shot dead Wednesday, since the opposition launched a general strike in the Himalayan kingdom on April 6.
Officials claimed security forces opened fire Wednesday only after being shot at during an assault by brick-throwing protesters in Chandragadi, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of Katmandu.
The government has made such claims in the past, but no shootings by protesters have been independently verified.
The region's chief administrator, Bhola Siwakoti, said the demonstrators had defied a ban on protests and were looting.
There were conflicting reports of how many were killed Wednesday. The Defense Ministry said two people died, another Nepali official put the toll at four, and a U.N. official said it was five. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the situation's sensitivity.
""The events show how desperate the present royal regime is. It is becoming paranoid,"" said Dhruba Adhikary of the independent Nepal Press Institute. ""The movement is getting popular. It is expanding and growing.""

The guerrillas on August 24 lifted the week-long blockade that had hit deliveries of food and fuel. 
But they threatened to resume it in another month unless the government releases information about missing rebel suspects and frees jailed ones.
A report by the Investigation Commission said that out of the 54 Maoists, 17 were in detention, seven had died in clashes with security forces and the rest had been released, according to a home ministry statement.
The Maoists' call for information has also been a key condition for resumption of a peace dialogue with the government and an end to their shutdown of dozens of companies, which has hit an already desperately poor economy.
The commission will investigate the cases of more Maoists reported missing and its tenure has been extended by a month, the statement said.

Moving a motion on the threat posed by such influx in the State Assembly, United Democratic Party (UDP) legislator Ardent M Basaiawmoit said, ""the unregulated inflow of illegal immigrants in the State is an alarming trend that could spiral out of control and threaten the very survival of local tribal population"".
Criticizing the government on failing to take strong measures, he added: ""The question that comes to everyone's mind is whether Shillong or any others part of Meghalaya is next on the target of sleeper cells of Jihadi groups.""
The legislator also suggested that the Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty should exempt Meghalaya to control the unabated influx of Nepalese citizens in the State.
Supporting the UDP legislator, the opposition Congress legislators, too, asked the government to adopt strong mechanism to tackle the problem.

A quarrel had occurred between the local people and the armyman involved in the shootings, according to the local people. The armyman, who got into a fit of anger, carried out the shootings, killing the civilians, it is said.
After the on-the-spot inspection of the incident, the army has formed an investigation committee headed by an army brigadier general. The probe panel, which is asked to present its report within three days, has already started its work, the army has said. The army termed the incident as unexpected and regrettable.

"5204",20061878,"Title: Nepal 's king breaks silence amid crisis, but offers few concessions to opponents.rtf; Date: April 15, 2006 Saturday 12:22 AM GMT; Text: A legendary curse on Nepal's Shah dynasty holds that its line of Hindu god-kings would end after 11 generations. It's made it to 12 with the current monarch, Gyanendra.
Yet after nine days of often violent protests against his absolute rule demonstrations that have seen thousands chant ""hang the king!"" how much longer Gyanendra can hold onto his crown of peacock feathers, yak hairs and jewels is an open question. Especially after he failed in a speech Friday to offer any major concessions to his opponents.
In a land once considered an exotic Shangri-La a mountain kingdom of Hindu temples, Buddhist shrines and towering peaks, like Mt. Everest a medieval monarchy is facing modern-day unrest as pro-democracy protesters take to the streets of Nepal's towns and cities.
With his opponents growing more strident by the day, ""even if he cedes power tomorrow, there will always be a question of whether the monarchy is needed,"" said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the respected Samay weekly.
Even so, Gyanendra appears unready to give up the power he seized back for his dynasty in February 2005, 15 years after his older brother introduced democracy following widespread civil unrest.
In a message for Nepal's new year, Gyanendra on Friday repeated calls for a dialogue with the opposition, and for elections to be held offers that were once again rejected by his opponents, who along with the international community say are attempts by the king to consolidate his grip on power.
Instead, they demand a special assembly be convened to rewrite the constitution and limit the king's role in this country of 27 million people, if he is given any at all.
The opposition vowed to hold more protests Saturday, although on Friday there were only sporadic demonstrations across the country as Nepalis celebrated the start of the year 2063.
For many here, the speech's rehashed overtures and failure to directly mention the protests are signs of how far-removed Gyanendra is from ordinary Nepalis.
""We are not stupid like peasants living in the mud,"" said Yubaraj Baral, a 34-year-old shop owner, who has taken part in the protests.
""He thinks he can ignore the people,"" Baral said, angrily pointing to the fact Gyanendra spent the first six days of the protests at his lakeside residence in the resort town of Pokhara. ""This is why we will kill him.""
Strong words considering that for generations of Nepalis Baral's parents among them kings were never mere mortal rulers.
Tradition holds that Nepal's monarchs are reincarnations of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu, to be venerated by their subjects, over whom they once held near absolute sway.
Even today, ancient traditions run deep in the palace, just as they do throughout Nepal, and the king, who was educated at a Jesuit school, consults astrologers and oracles for advice.
Reverence for the king can also be seen among the country's elite ""my king never makes mistakes,"" Information Minister Shrish Sumshere Rana told journalists Friday.
A 2001 palace massacre in which the crown prince gunned down his father, the late King Birendra, and much of his family and then killed himself, brought his uncle, Gyanendra, to the throne and also helped pierce the mystique surrounding Nepal's royalty.
Four years later, Gyanendra seized power, saying he would bring order to a chaotic political scene and quell a communist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the past decade.
But the worsening insurgency, faltering economy and Gyanendra's heavy-handed tactics he's jailed opponents and banned criticism of himself, his government and the army have left Nepalis questioning his commitment to democracy.
The severe response to the protests in recent days has only fueled resentment. Four people have been fatally shot by security forces and hundreds have been beaten.
""If the police and army beat the people, the people will beat the king,"" said Anik Moktan, a 26-year-old student.
Gyanendra's extreme wealth in a deeply poor land hasn't helped his case. Before assuming the throne, he was known as hardheaded businessman with interests in tourism, tea and tobacco, and after the massacre he is said to have inherited much of his family's wealth.
""How can such a man who spends millions and millions on cars and clothes and going on foreign travel rule a poor country?"" asked G.C. Chetri, a 23-year-old student.
Royalists, meanwhile, are keeping quiet.
For the first few days, Krishna Bushan didn't pay much attention to the demonstrations in his neighborhood. But as the protests grew angrier, the 36-year-old civil servant decided Saturday to take down the portrait of Gyanendra and Queen Kamal that hung above his sofa. He now keeps it propped up against his bedroom wall.
""It's not good if people see that we love our king,"" he said, glancing at the portrait, orange flower garlands dangling over the yellowing image of the bejeweled royals.
""How can we survive without them?"" he asked. It was a question, he said, that he h"
"7251",2009686,"Title: Bangladesh faces high risk of quakes - experts.rtf; Date: Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring; Text: August 12, 2009 Wednesday
Text of report headlined ""Bangladesh runs high quake risk"" published by Bangladesh newspaper The Daily Star website on 12 August
Bangladesh faces a high risk of moderate to strong earthquakes that may result in widespread damage and loss of thousands of lives, said experts.
Bangladesh also faces the risk of tsunami as four active sources of earthquake in the Bay of Bengal can generate tremors with a magnitude of over seven on the Richter scale in the Bay affecting the country seriously.
The observatory at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) recorded 86 tremors of over four magnitude during January 2006-May 2009. Another four earthquakes took place with magnitude of over five during the period.
The meteorological department detected at least 90 earthquakes taking place in the country between May 2007 and July 2008, nine of them above five on the Richter scale and epicentres of 95 per cent being within a 600 kilometre radius of Dhaka city.
Experts say it is these minor tremors that indicate the possibility of much more powerful earthquakes hitting the country.
According to a seismic zoning map prepared by the Buet, 43 percent areas in Bangladesh are rated high risk, 41 percent moderate and 16 percent low, said Prof Mehdi Ahmed Ansary.
The map, which is being drawn up under the supervision of Prof Ansary with funding provided by the science and information and communications technology ministry, divides the country into three earthquake vulnerability zones.
Panchagarh, Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Mymensingh, Netrakona, Sunamganj, Kishoreganj, Moulvibazar, Sylhet, Habiganj and Brahmanbaria are placed in the highest risk zone. Parts of Thakurgaon, Sirajganj, Tangail, Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Cox's Bazar also fall into the category, said Prof Ansary.
Zone-2 includes Rajshahi, Natore, Magura, Meherpur, Comilla, Brahmanbaria, Feni and Dhaka while zone-3 is made up of all the islands, Barisal and Patuakhali.
The current zoning map has, however, not been included in the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC), which needs to be urgently updated, pointed out Ansary, who is also vice-president of the Bangladesh Earthquake Society.
In the zoning map of 1993, which was included in the BNBC, 26 percent of the country was high risk, 38 percent moderate and 36 percent low in terms of earthquake vulnerability.
ASM Maksud Kamal, an expert on earthquake and tsunami preparedness, said four sources of earthquake in the Bay of Bengal are active and can generate tsunami.
He said one of the sources generated an earthquake of 7.8 magnitude in 1762 which generated Fiche, waves caused by earthquakes in rivers and other closed water bodies, and around 100 people were killed in boat capsizes at that time in the Buriganga.
Kamal said all the four sources in the Bay called F1, F2, F3 and F4 have a capability of generating earthquakes of over 7 magnitude creating tsunami which will affect Bangladesh.
In that case the sea level will rise by 4-5 metres at Nijhum Dwip. The water level will rise 2-3 metres at the Sundarbans, Cox's Bazar and the estuary of the Meghna.
Kamal said seven major earthquakes struck Bangladesh during the last 150 years and only two had the epicentre within the country.
The Srimangal earthquake on July 8, 1918 was recorded at 7.6 on the Richter scale and its epicentre was in Balisera valley near Srimangal. Although there was damage, the intensity rapidly decreased due to the shallow focal depth and only minor effects were felt in Dhaka, he said.
The Bengal earthquake of July 14, 1885 caused considerable damage in the Sirajganj-Bogra region and perhaps more severe destruction in Jamalpur-Sherpur-Mymensingh region. The magnitude of the earthquake was more than 7.0 on the Richter scale and the epicentre was at Manikganj, he added.
During the 1762 earthquake in Chittagong-Arakan coast the magnitude was 7.6 but the exact epicentre remained unclear.
The great Indian earthquake of June 12, 1897 that had a magnitude of 8.7 with the epicentre in the central part of the Shillong plateau was recalled as one of the world's worst.
Based on the epicentres of earlier earthquakes, Dhaka has crossed 130 years, Chittagong has crossed 250 years and Sylhet about 100 years, which now raises the prospect of a major earthquake striking Bangladesh, said Kamal.
He observed that fault zones like Dauki fault zone, Shahjibazar fault zone and Tripura to Assam fault zone are very active and have been generating energy for quite a long time but as no earthquake occurred in those areas, it is a matter of time before the big one strikes.
Prof Ansary said eight fault zones are active in Bangladesh. They are Bogra fault zone, Tanore fault zone in Rajshahi, Tripura fault zone, Sitakunda-Teknaf fault zone, Dauki fault zone (Haluaghat Fault), Dhubri fault zone, Chittagong fault zone, Shahjibazar fault zone (sub-Dauki fault) and Rangamati fault zone (Borcal).
